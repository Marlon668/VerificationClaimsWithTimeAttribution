pomt-01219	In rural Virginia, "Sen. Warner ran 8-10 points ahead of a traditional Democrat -- ahead of Senator Kaine, ahead of Governor McAuliffe."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/21/david-hallock/mark-warner-got-more-rural-votes-other-democratic-/	Plenty of Monday morning quarterbacks attended a recent seminar where a political adviser to Democratic incumbent Mark Warner and one for Republican Ed Gillespie looked back on Virginia’s surprisingly close U.S. Senate election. A woman in the audience at George Mason University asked if Warner’s margin of victory -- less than 18,000 votes out of almost 2.2 million cast -- would have been greater if the senator had spent less time campaigning in rural areas and more time stumping in populous Northern Virginia, a haven for statewide Democratic candidates. The woman was echoing a question raised by many pundits after the election. David Hallock, a Warner adviser, replied that rural votes helped Warner win. "You look at the kind of Republican areas, the rural areas, Senator Warner ran 8-10 points ahead of a traditional Democrat -- ahead of Senator Kaine, ahead of Governor McAuliffe in those areas -- which is more than the margin of victory at the end of the day," he said. Warner has long prided himself as a vote-getter in rural Virginia, pursuing a so-called "Bubba strategy," attending NASCAR races and even commissioning a blue-grass campaign song during his successful 2001 run for governor. We examined whether Warner this year really did top the past rural vote performances of two stalwarts in his party -- Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. Terry McAuliffe -- by the 8-10 percent margin Hallock cited. The first step was to define rural Virginia. We relied on a state map highlighting 52 localities that the federal government defines as rural. Then, we compared Warner’s 2014 votes in those places to the results from McAuliffe’s 2013 gubernatorial election and Kaine’s 2012 Senate contest. Here’s how the statewide rural vote broke down: Warner, 2014: 39 percent McAuliffe, 2013: 35.6 percent Kaine, 2012: 41.4 percent The rural localities form six regions. Here’s how Warner’s performance compared to the other Democrats in each of those areas: Eastern Shore: Warner, 44.2 percent; McAuliffe, 42.8 percent; Kaine, 50.3 percent. Northern Neck: Warner, 41.2 percent; McAuliffe, 39.1 percent; Kaine, 45.8 percent. Shenandoah: Warner, 33.3 percent, McAuliffe, 34 percent; Kaine, 39.9 percent. Alleghany: Warner, 37.1 percent; McAuliffe, 33.4 percent; Kaine, 38.5 percent. Southside: Warner, 48.5 percent; McAuliffe, 45.3 percent; Kaine, 51.3 percent. Southwest: Warner, 35.9 percent; McAuliffe, 29.7 percent; Kaine, 35.3 percent. The 39 percent overall rural vote for Warner this fall was considerably below the level he achieved during his other successful campaigns. Warner got 61.2 percent of the rural vote in his 2008 landslide victory for the U.S. Senate over Republican Jim Gilmore; he got 51.2 percent in his 2001 gubernatorial win over Republican Mark Earley. Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the decline in Warner’s vote percentages this year -- not just in rural areas but across Virginia -- may be due to the senator’s positioning as a centrist. "The moderate strategy that worked so well for Warner back in the day, just doesn’t work as well today," Farnsworth said. "The real polarization of politics means there’s just not as many people interested in a moderate politician. The strategy of winning over moderate rural voters doesn’t work well when there aren’t many moderate rural voters." As we mentioned, a number of pundits question whether some of Warner’s time courting rural voters would have been better spent wooing Northern Virginians. We’re not taking sides in this debate, but thought we’d offer a few statistics to put it in perspective. Unofficially, Warner won by 17,723 votes. The State Board of Elections is scheduled the certify the final results on Monday. In rural Virginia, Gillespie got 163,608 votes and Warner received 108,772. Gillespie won a 54,386-vote edge. In Northern Virginia, Warner gained 358,878 votes, 57.4 percent, and Gillespie got 252,584 votes, 40.4 percent. Warner won a 106,294-vote advantage in the region. Our ruling Hallock said Warner, in this fall’s Senate election, ran "8-10 points ahead" of past performances by fellow Democrats McAuliffe and Kaine in rural Virginia. He’s flat out wrong. McAuliffe’s portion of the rural vote, in his 2013 gubernatorial victory, was 3.6 percentage points below Warner’s. Kaine’s slice of the rural vote, in his 2012 Senate win, was 2.4 percentage points above Warner’s. We rate Hallock’s statement False. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said Hallock did not respond to three emails seeking data for his claim. Our requests were sent to an incorrect email address for Hallock.

pomt-14321	When it comes to fighting terrorism, "Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/30/hillary-clinton/evidence-backs-hillary-clinton-claim-torture-count/	The day after the March 22 terrorist attack in Brussels, former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave a speech at Stanford University talking about ISIS, the threat of terrorism and whether torture is a useful tool to fight it. "One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims," she said, adding, "Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture." "Many intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact. It also puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk," Clinton said. Most of us can see ourselves spilling the beans on anything and everything if we were subjected to the kinds of "enhanced interrogation techniques" that suspected terrorists have been subjected to by the United States since 9/11. We wondered if, as Clinton contended, it has been well established that torture does not work. Tell them what they want to hear Because nobody's going to volunteer to be part of a scientific study where you might get tortured — ethics review boards might be apoplectic about such a proposal — the only way to examine the issue is through case studies. The experts with whom we spoke said that, for a host of reasons, torture has long been recognized as an inefficient way to get information. The biggest problem is that it tends to produce wrong information. The United States Army Field Manual warns that information gathered by torture can be faulty. That's because, during torture, truth becomes irrelevant. And when the interrogators don't know if the information is true, the torture may continue even if the detainee tells the truth. At that point, the captive will fabricate information with the goal of telling the interrogator what he wants to hear. "It is enormously well documented (including by the Senate study of the CIA program) that torture generated enormous amounts of false statements," said Lisa Hajjar, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies torture. (More about the Senate study in a bit.) One example was the case of Abu Zubaydah, initially billed by the Bush administration as al-Qaida's chief of operations. Waterboarded 83 times, he told tales of planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. Critics say that's because he knew little. Joining al-Qaida after 9/11, he scheduled people to move in and out of training camps and was mentally challenged. Before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration said it had "information that Iraq had been training al-Qaida operatives in the use of chemical weapons, thus connecting Iraq to 9/11," said Hajjar in a review article in the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. "This information was extracted by torture from a Libyan prisoner, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, who subsequently recanted the lies he had told interrogators to make the pain stop." Bad truth detectors Interrogators aren’t particularly good at telling when someone under torture is lying or telling the truth. "Interrogators in these situations think they're perfect lie detectors but research tells us quite differently," said Darius Rejali, a torture expert at Reed College in Oregon. Special training programs designed to enhance that ability "make the interrogators more confident that they can detect the truth, but in fact they would be better off flipping a coin." In the current war on terror, consider the case of Hassan Ghul. After his capture, he was cooperative without being tortured and provided information key to finding Osama bin Laden through bin Laden's associate, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. But after he cooperated, the CIA decided to torture Ghul anyway. It produced no useful additional intelligence. "The people who do know something will lie whether you torture them or not. The problem comes when you pull people in who don't know anything, and they're claiming that they do," said Rejali. That opens the door to all kinds of fanciful intelligence from crazed-from-torture informants. "Sleep deprivation will make you imagine you were there shooting (President John) Kennedy behind the grassy knoll," said Rejali. Another issue is that news reports of torture turn public opinion against authorities who condone or permit torture. Rejali cited the cases of a 2005 bombing attempt in London. When video of the bomber aired, "the parents came forward and said, 'He's our son. He's the killer.' Would the parents have come forward if they knew their son was going to be tortured? You can be fairly certain the answer to that is no." "Not only does torture undermine what we know works, which is public cooperation, but it can also deeply alter the duration, severity and cost of a conflict," he said. "Torture alienates societies needed for war efforts," said Hajjar. Senate torture report When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released when Democrats controlled the Senate. The full document, about 6,700 pages and approved in 2012, remains classified. A 525-page redacted executive summary was released in December 2014. There's also a minority report developed by Republicans on the committee and a CIA response. The majority report says techniques such as waterboarding, standing sleep deprivation, forced feeding through a rectal tube, temperature extremes and confinement in coffin-sized boxes were not effective for getting intelligence from people detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The committee's analysis of 20 prominent cases that reportedly "saved lives" — cited by the CIA and the Bush administration — found either that the key information was gathered before torture began, the information was already available to the intelligence community before the enhanced techniques were initiated, or there was no relationship between those success stories and the information provided by the detainees. For example, the majority report says that "CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports." Another example: The CIA said Ghul, the detainee who gave information that eventually led to the location of bin Laden, had been subjected to harsh interrogation and had produced valuable information. The agency neglected to mention that the information came before Ghul was subjected to enhanced interrogation. Other instances where the Bush administration said enhanced interrogation — described by the president as tough, safe, lawful and necessary — produced valuable intelligence have also been debunked. The minority report says that in many of the 20 cases, enhanced interrogation tactics did produce significant breakthroughs, although sometimes as part of a delayed cascade effect. The problem with most of the accounts of people who say that torture works, said Rejali, is that only the cases where it seemed to succeed are remembered and the ones where it didn't are forgotten. "In the two and a half years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies arrested more that 5,000 suspected terrorists," said Mark Costanzo of Claremont McKenna College and Ellen Gerrity of Duke University, writing in the journal Social Issues and Policy Review. "There was sufficient hard evidence to bring formal charges against only three of these suspects, and only one of these three was convicted." Our ruling Clinton said that when it comes to fighting terrorism, "Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture." When it comes to the real goal of getting useful intelligence, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the details interrogators will get from a detainee can typically be acquired without torture. When torture is used, the "information" extracted is likely to be fiction created by a prisoner who will say anything to get the punishment to stop. All ethical issues aside, the experts say, it doesn't work because it is extremely inefficient and, in many ways, counterproductive. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14653	"According to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to third best in the country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/22/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsins-high-school-graduatio/	State of the State addresses tend to be bursting with boasts and brags. But given the preparation that goes into such speeches, claims made in them are probably more likely to be on target than off-the-cuff remarks. That’s essentially what we have with one in a string of education boasts made by Gov. Scott Walker during his sixth State of the State, given Jan. 19, 2016. "In our state, fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores went up again in 2015," the governor said. "And according to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to the third-best in the country." Given the nature of his speech, Walker clearly was taking some credit for the graduation rate apparently rising and the ranking being so high. Let’s take a look. Old claim, new claim Walker made a similar statement in April 2014. He said the state’s high school graduation rate and third-grade reading scores had improved on his watch. Our rating was Mostly True. Both numbers were up since 2010, the year before Walker took office. But some credit could have been to due prior elected officials, and the trend lines hadn’t changed much going back to prior to 2010. The graduation rate covers students in public high schools who earn a regular diploma within four years of starting high school. To back Walker’s new claim, his office cited an October 2015 news release from the state Department of Public Instruction about the latest graduation data. The release said federal data released that month showed Wisconsin’s graduation rate for the 2013-’14 school year was 88.6 percent. That rate was up 0.6 percentage points from the previous year, ranking Wisconsin third in the country, according to the release. Here’s how the federal data listed the top states: Public high school graduation rate, 2013-’14 school year Rank/State Rate 1. Iowa 90.5% 2. Nebraska 89.7% 3. (tie) Wisconsin and New Jersey 88.6% Now the federal data for the previous school year: Public high school graduation rate, 2012-’13 school year Rank/State Rate 1. Iowa 89.7% 2. Nebraska 88.5% 3. (tie) Wisconsin and Texas 88% So, Wisconsin’s graduation rate did improve, but its rank did not. Our rating Walker said: "According to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to third best in the country." The latest-available graduation rate for public high school students in Wisconsin was 88.6 percent in the 2013-’14 school year. That’s up sixth-tenths of a percentage point from the previous year. But Wisconsin’s rank -- third -- did not change. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True. More on education Wisconsin Democratic Party: Wisconsin dropped "from second in the country to 41st" among states where more than half the students took the ACT exam. Pants on Fire. Activist Scot Ross: Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin "moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt." Mostly False. Lawmaker Jennifer Shilling: A "voucher school that closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening." Mostly True.

pomt-14567	"Making public colleges and universities tuition-free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-sanders/was-college-once-free-united-states-and-it-oversea/	Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are battling for the "most progressive" label in the Democratic presidential primary, and for Sanders that includes his call for free tuition at public colleges and universities. During the Feb. 4 debate in New Hampshire, Sanders argued that there is a precedent for free tuition in the United States and overseas. "Now, all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas," Sanders said. "Making public colleges and universities tuition-free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States." How common is free college tuition worldwide and did it used to exist in the United States? College costs overseas A spokesman for Sanders referred us to a 2014 report from the Organization for Economic Co‑operation and Development, a group that compares data on a variety of topics in advanced industrial nations. We obtained the 2015 report from OECD that showed the number of countries with no tuition as of 2013-14: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden and Turkey. Germany also now has free tuition at public universities, although students pay some fees. "Yes, it’s free -- it’s the German taxpayer paying for it," said Peter Kerrigan, deputy director of German Academic Exchange Service. "Somebody is footing the bill. It’s just not the student." For the Nordic countries that charge no tuition, individuals face high income tax rates. The approach to funding higher education "reflects these countries’ deeply rooted social values, such as equality of opportunity and social equity," states an OECD report. College tuition in the U.S. College tuition has never been set on a nationwide basis, said John R. Thelin, professor at the University of Kentucky and author of A History of American Higher Education. Instead, it has been set by each state or college and is subject to approval by the legislature or board of trustees. However, there are examples of some colleges or universities offering free tuition decades ago, especially universities established through federal land grants starting in the 1860s. "Public colleges and universities were often free at their founding in the United States, but over time, as public support was reduced or not increased sufficiently to compensate for their growth in students and costs (faculty and staff salaries, utilities etc.), they moved first to a low tuition and eventually higher tuition policy," said Cornell University professor Ronald Gordon Ehrenberg. For example, California offered free tuition to in-state students until the 1970s, although it charged an "incidental fee" starting in 1921. Baruch College in New York was founded in 1847 as the Free Academy, the first free public institution of higher education in the nation, according to the college, which is now part of the City University system of New York. At least some students were paying by the early 20th century, and 1976 marked the end of any tuition-free policy. At the University of Florida, a school catalog from 1905-06 stated: "No tuition is charged to students whose home is in Florida. All other students will be required to pay a tuition fee of twenty ($20) dollars per year." Public higher education was often free when a very small percentage of students attended, said Roger L. Geiger, education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II. "Historically, many individual institutions refrained from student charges, including early Stanford. Community colleges were often free, being considered an extension of secondary schools." he said. In Sanders’ home state at the University of Vermont, a book about the school’s history indicates that tuition was charged in the 19th century. Senior class tuition was $8.34 in 1827. "I don't think there was ever a time that UVM did not charge tuition," said Jeffrey D. Marshall, director of research collections. Sanders talked about public colleges, but we heard about at least one private university that offered free tuition for decades: Rice Institute, later which became Rice University. That university in Texas charged tuition for the first time in 1965. There are also a few small private colleges or universities that are tuition free today, such as Berea College. Our ruling Sanders said, "Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States." There are at least nine advanced countries that offer free college, including the recent addition of Germany. There was a time in the United States when some public colleges and universities charged no tuition. However, tuition has never been set as a national policy -- it is a decision for each school or state government officials. And some colleges charged tuition dating back to the 1800s. Sanders' statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-12748	Says his budget "calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/01/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-historic-defense-increase/	In his address to Congress, President Donald Trump said his budget "calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." Trump’s budget director Mick Mulvaney gave reporters a broad overview of the president’s budget Feb. 27. He said the White House wants to spend $603 billion on defense. Mulvaney compared that to the $549 billion allowed under spending caps based on a 2011 budget control law. On that basis, Trump seeks nearly a 10 percent increase. But when we looked at past budgets, we found there have been much heftier jumps in military spending. As America entered WWII, its defense spending more than doubled. However, that was a world war, so a fairer comparison might be more recent budgets. But even over the past 35 years, Trump’s plan still isn’t exceptional. A word of caution: Making apples-to-apples comparisons in defense spending can be tricky. Budget writers talk about the base defense budget. That number excludes billions for Overseas Contingency Operations, a big ticket item that covers the costs of actually fighting wars. Right now, that spending adds about $55 billion to the Pentagon’s account. When the contingency money is factored in, spending today is about $587 billion. This difference can lead to some confusion as people debate the magnitude of Trump’s request. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Trump’s plan raises the Pentagon’s budget by only about $18 billion. But he’s comparing Trump’s apparent base request to the full Pentagon budget. So with that in mind, let’s go back in time. President Jimmy Carter’s last budget kicked up military spending 25 percent in 1981. President Ronald Reagan’s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised it by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008. Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, had a tempered view of Trump’s assertion. "The defense budget Trump proposed for 2018 is a significant increase, but it is not one of the largest increases," Harrison told PolitiFact. During Trump's speech, Harrison tweeted this chart, which excludes war-related money. By Harrison’s count, since 1977, there have been 10 increases that were at least a little bit larger than what Trump has in mind. Laicie Heeley, a defense budget analyst at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, said, "Trump's historical increase is actually quite average." We reached out to the White House and were still waiting for a response when we published. Our ruling Trump said his budget plan has one of the largest increases in defense spending in the country’s history. Looking strictly at money for the Pentagon’s base budget, Trump is calling for about a 10 percent hike in spending. But in the past three decades, there have been 10 years when the base defense budget has gone up more than what Trump has requested. In some years, the increase was more than double Trump’s. The term "one of the largest" has some leeway, but the defense analysts we reached said while it is a significant increase, it is not remarkable.

pomt-12230	"There was someone else on that plane for the secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch meeting."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/18/blog-posting/fake-news-saga-claims-paul-ryan-attended-loretta-l/	An online post that said House Speaker Paul Ryan witnessed the 2016 meeting between former President Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch is a fake news story that is part of a larger contrived saga. A headline on a July 11, 2017, post on Wazanews.tk read, "There was someone else on that plane for the secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch meeting." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post is based on a real June 27, 2016, meeting Clinton and Lynch had on the tarmac of the Phoenix airport, which drew fire because former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was under investigation for keeping a private email server. Supposedly new information about the meeting came to light, the post said. A Baltimore Morning News reporter determined from flight paperwork that Ryan traveled with Lynch to Phoenix, specifically to attend the meeting with Clinton. The story launched into several melodramatic theories why the trio were meeting, including possibly brokering then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s "freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss." There’s no newspaper called the Baltimore Morning News, and there’s no proof Ryan was at all involved in the meeting, because the story is fake. Wazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam, but the story appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com, which makes up its content. OurLandOfTheFree.com said it "makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality." There is no contact information readily available on the site. The site followed up this story about Ryan joining Clinton and Lynch with several more posts. One said a Justice Department pilot was going to spill the beans about the meeting on Fox News, but ended up being found dead (but not before leaving behind details of the discussion). Again, none of it is true. This is another example of a series of fake stories attempting to fool readers with a bogus saga about an oft-cited political event. We rate the claim Pants On Fire! Editor's note: The meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch was in 2016. A typo in an earlier version of the story had the incorrect year.

pomt-10854	"The Z-visa that was offered in that Senate bill let everybody who's here illegally, other than criminals, stay here for the rest of their lives."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/06/mitt-romney/z-visas-have-many-requirements/	At a Republican debate on Sept. 5, 2007, Romney criticized a provision in a Senate bill that would allow some immigrants to remain in the United States. His full quote: "The Z-visa that was offered in that Senate bill let everybody who's here illegally, other than criminals, stay here for the rest of their lives. And that may not be technically amnesty, but it is certainly amnesty in fact." But that's an inaccurate description of the bill. Only immigrants who meet certain requirements will be able to stay here "for the rest of their lives." For instance, immigrants who have entered before January 1, 2007 are eligible to apply for Z visas.

pomt-04109	"The amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/13/dawson-hodgson/rhode-island-sen-dawson-hodgson-says-state-spends-/	Supporters of the University of Rhode Island complain that it doesn't get enough state funding, particularly amid calls for a better educated, more competitive state work force. State financing per URI student has fallen by an inflation-adjusted 47 percent since 2002, one national report said last year. State Sen. Dawson T. Hodgson, R-North Kingstown, raised the issue in a Jan. 3, 2012, radio interview on WPRO-AM. Hodgson talked about the state budget as more than a financial document, but, rather, as a statement of values and priorities. In that vein, he noted, "the amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island." We hit the books to see whether the legislature-URI comparison passes the test. We called Hodgson, who said he would supply figu res the next day. In the meantime, we checked with Robert A. Weygand, URI's vice president of administration and finance, who walked us through university budget documents showing that the state contributed $58.1 million for URI operations this fiscal year. Weygand said that if you factor in state contributions used to pay debt on voter-approved bonds for some university buildings -- money URI doesn’t see for yearly operations -- the total state contribution would be about $77.3 million. State Budget Officer Thomas Mullaney told us the part-time legislature was budgeted to receive $37.2 million in state funding this year. Adding in federal funds brings that to $38.8 million. And money not spent last year brings this year’s total budget to about $40.4 million, he said. The state funding pays for day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives and Senate, mostly for salaries for staff such as legislative pages and researchers. When we heard from Hodgson by e-mail, he provided figures showing the same $58.1-million that Weygand cited for the state’s contribution to URI and $38.8 million for the legislature. Any way you crunch the numbers, the state’s contribution to URI is still many millions of dollars more than what it is for the legislature, not nearly the same, as Hodgson said. Hodgson said the context for his statement on the radio is important, noting that the state’s contribution to URI amounts to little more than 8 percent of the university’s $706-million budget. "I believe that investing in public higher education must be a priority for sustained economic growth, and I am not satisfied with the value we are getting for our money from our part-time legislature," Hodgson said by e-mail. Our ruling Dawson Hodgson said, "The amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island." In fact, the state contributes $58 million to URI, roughly $20 million more than the legislature’s budget. That’s not "nearly as much." Whether Hodgson’s point about budget priorities is valid or not, he got the numbers wrong. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12912	"Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jan/18/carlos-guillermo-smith/after-fort-lauderdale-airport-shooting-legislator-/	The suspect in the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport told the FBI in Alaska in November that he was hearing voices. Anchorage police confiscated Esteban Santiago’s handgun and took him for a mental health evaluation. Police returned his gun to him in December when he asked for it. On Jan. 6, he flew to Broward County and is the suspected gunman in a rampage at the airport that left five dead and several others injured. Days later, Democratic state legislators held a press conference in Tallahassee to argue for gun control measures and more mental health funding. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, said that Republican legislators argue that the way to reduce gun violence is not through gun control but mental health care funding. But Florida, he said, has the worst record in the nation in terms of funding mental health care treatment. "We see once again Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding — 50th," he said. "There is no one that is doing worse than we are when it comes to making sure we that we are providing comprehensive mental health care." Florida is near the bottom of the pack in mental health funding, and one key ranking cited by many experts places the state at 51st in per capita spending. However, there are some caveats about the ranking. Comparing state mental health funding Smith pointed to news articles about Florida’s low ranking on mental health funding and data from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. Mental health funding experts said they consider the institute’s data as the best source. The institute collects annual data on expenditures by state mental health agencies from the states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The total amount of expenditures is divided by the state population to compare the amount per capita. The most recent data, for fiscal year 2014, showed Florida ranked 51st out of 52 jurisdictions for total state mental health spending — behind 49 states and Washington, D.C. — at $36.05 per capita. The Sunshine State was only ahead of one jurisdiction: Puerto Rico, at $20.22. Florida has consistently been near the bottom of the rankings for years, said Ted Lutterman, senior director of the institute. In general, states in the northeast and northwest spend more, while southern states spend much less, he said. One key caveat about this data: It is based on money spent through Florida’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Office, managed by the Department of Children and Families, and it doesn’t include services paid from other sources, including Medicaid or local funds, on mental health programs. "Those additional funding sources aren’t reported to DCF, but they’re still used within the local systems of care to treat individuals," said Jessica Sims, DCF spokeswoman. The national research institute asks the state mental health authority in each state to provide information on all the funds used for its public mental health provider system, including state psychiatric hospitals and community providers. If another state agency uses Medicaid funds to pay for services directly and doesn’t work with the state mental health authority, then the state mental health authority will not have that data, Lutterman said. In most states, the state mental health authority helps manage the Medicaid funds. However Florida administers Medicaid differently, Lutterman said, and therefore isn’t able to report the Medicaid data for this report. The National Alliance on Mental Illness uses the per-capita state expenditures to compare rankings, said the alliance’s spokesman Bob Carolla. "It reflects the relative degree of commitment to mental health by the state," he said. "Medicaid dollars compared to Medicaid dollars could be a separate indicator, except I believe it’s more problematic because of the differences that exist between the state Medicaid programs." Florida lags behind the majority of states on Medicaid spending per enrollee and the state Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act. Another way to examine mental health funding is to look at whether states are increasing the amount each year. The National Alliance on Mental Illness annual survey of state mental health care legislation doesn’t rank states but shows general budgeting trends. The 2015 report shows Florida maintained funding in 2013 and increased it in 2014 and 2015. Our ruling Smith said, "Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding." A key source of data for ranking states on mental health spending is the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. That data shows that Florida ranked 51st in 2014. However, it is difficult to compare Florida with other states because it administers its Medicaid program differently than most states.

pomt-12578	California will have the "highest gas tax in the nation" once its 12 cent gas tax hike goes into effect.	false	/california/statements/2017/apr/11/jim-patterson/will-california-soon-have-highest-gas-tax-nation/	Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno recently claimed California would soon have the "highest gas tax in the nation." He made the claim in a press release days after the California Legislature passed a 12 cent per gallon gasoline tax hike, part of a funding package to raise billions of dollars for state road repairs. "The $52 billion tax will also put Californians in a special, yet unenviable category – drivers who pay the highest gas tax in the nation," Patterson said in the release issued April 10, 2017. With Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s signature the bill will go into effect in November. The Golden State’s per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country. Our research Asked for evidence, Patterson’s spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates produced in March 2016 by the nonprofit Tax Foundation. That map and its numbers, however, are outdated. A map produced in January 2017 by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates. Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees. It shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58 cents. California’s current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation. Do the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California’s tax will trail Pennsylvania’s by 8 cents per gallon. "You won’t be No. 1, that’s for sure," said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. "Pennsylvania will still be the highest." A chart produced in January 2017 by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation’s figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state. Based on current rates, California’s increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii. This second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts. We looked at that topic in a recent article. As of this week, California’s average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii’s $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said. Joe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline. This sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state’s gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which "would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania," Henchman said. Five other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not. Our ruling Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California’s recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the "highest gas tax in the nation." Patterson relied on outdated gas tax rates. Current figures from the Tax Foundation show California’s per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania’s rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November. California would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation. These figures are also confirmed by the American Petroleum Institute. In the end, we rate Patterson’s claim False. UPDATE: This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline. The foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California’s new legislation. It concluded "Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin." This latest update factors in an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November. The state’s full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California’s overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation’s latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson's claim as False as the foundation concluded this higher California gas tax, even in 2019, would be "just behind Pennsylvania's highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax."

pomt-10719	"The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/26/mitt-romney/overall-violence-declined-under-romney/	After Rudy Giuliani attacked Mitt Romney for rising crime rates in Massachusetts, Romney shot back: "The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent. So he's wrong again on the facts." Take apart the FBI crime figures, and you'll see that Romney is right. But Giuliani is also right on a couple of points, particularly on rising murder and robberies. Here's how the numbers break down: Romney became governor in January 2003 and left office in January 2007. Comparing FBI crime statistics in Massachusetts for 2002 and 2006, we can calculate how crime rates changed during the Romney administration. To count violent crime, the FBI includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2002, that number was 31,137 in Massachusetts. In 2006, it was 28,775. That means violent crime declined 7.6 percent, just like Romney claims. But let's take a closer look at murders and robberies. Murders went up from 173 in 2002 to 186 in 2006, an increase of 7.5 percent. The murder rate — the number of people murdered per 100,000 people — moved up from 2.7 to 2.9. Robberies increased more than murders. Robberies in Massachusetts increased from 7,169 to 8,047, an increase of 12.2 percent. The robbery rate increased from 111.5 to 125. So what made the violent crime rate go down if murders and robberies went up? The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault, which declined from 22,018 to 18,800, a drop of 14.6 percent. Given these numbers, Giuliani is right when he says murders and robberies went up, but wrong when he says violent crime went up. Romney is correct when he says violent crime in Massachusetts declined, so we rate his claim True.

pomt-11934	The Obama administration "borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. ... Maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/12/donald-trump/donald-trumps-misleading-linkage-between-stock-gai/	President Donald Trump raised eyebrows with comments linking stock market gains with declines in the federal debt during two appearances to tout his tax proposal in Pennsylvania. First, in an Oct. 11 speech in an airplane hangar in Harrisburg, Trump said: "Just in the stock market alone, we have increased our economic worth by $5.2 trillion. That's right since Election Day -- $5.2 trillion. Think about that. That's a quarter of the $20 trillion that we owe. … In the last eight years of the previous administration, the debt doubled. … But since the election on Nov. 8, I've increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe. You haven't heard those numbers." During a subsequent interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Trump made the linkage between stock market gains and debt decreases even clearer. "The country — we took it over and owed over 20 trillion. As you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up 5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say, in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt." We decided to look into whether Trump had a point that the stock market gains on his watch effectively wiped out any of the debt incurred by his predecessor, Barack Obama. (The White House did not provide any further information to PolitiFact.) Trump is somewhat off-base with those numbers. But the bigger problem is that the stock market gains and the debt don’t have the relationship he implies. Wealth gains and federal debt are distinct As of Oct. 12, the most expansive figure for the federal debt is almost $20.4 trillion. About $9.2 trillion of that came between the inaugurations of President Barack Obama and Trump. So that wasn’t "more than $10 trillion," and it wasn’t double the cumulative debt when he took office. The increase in stock market values may also be a little high. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, told the Financial Post that the value has risen by about $4.4 trillion since the election. However, stock market gains accrue to stockholders; the government doesn’t get any of those increases to pay for government spending or to pay down the debt unless and until the assets are sold and taxed. (Only a communist government can seize private assets to pay down the debt.) So gaining a $5 trillion boost in stock values doesn’t simply enable the country to write off that much of its $20 trillion debt. "The president is conflating the stock market, which represents the wealth of private corporations, with the federal budget," said Chris Lafakis, director at Moody’s Analytics. "There is not a direct link between the two." The taxation of such assets is delayed until the asset is sold, which could take years. "At best, a small share of the increase in equity value will, some day, lead to higher capital gains taxes," said Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. And the rates at which such assets are taxed -- capital gains rates -- are relatively low compared to other forms of income taxes. "With a tax rate on capital gains of 15 percent, even if all the stocks that have risen were sold tomorrow, the federal government would only reap at most 15 percent of the $5 trillion in asset gain," said added Bruce Bartlett, who served as deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush. And some of these gains may never be taxed. That could be the case if the holdings are passed on to heirs in a modestly sized estate, or if they are held institutionally, such as by a university. Other gains may have accrued to pension funds, and taxes would only be paid when the pensions are paid out and taxed by the recipient. The actual gain to the Treasury stemming from this stock run-up "is completely out of whack" with what Trump suggests, Lafakis said. "We’re talking about tens of billions, maybe even over $100 billion in extra revenues if you adopt very extreme assumptions," he said. "That doesn’t even stop our debt from going up, let alone pay down a meaningful portion of it." All of this, of course, assumes that stock values, which fluctuate minute by minute, won’t fall. Since Election Day, the Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. stocks has risen by about 19 percent -- an impressive gain. But if we put this in context, other international stock markets have done even better. Specifically, Germany’s DAX has risen by 24 percent over the same period. France’s CAC 40 and the Netherlands’ AEX indexes have both risen by 20 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index has risen by 22 percent, and both Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and South Korea’s KOSPI have risen by 24 percent. Another nuance Trump didn’t capture: The lines between debt and wealth can be complicated. About one-third of the federal debt is held by foreign entities, but much of the rest is held by Americans -- and those federal bondholders count that "debt" on their own ledgers as "wealth." Meanwhile, some fraction of the stocks that produced the equity gains Trump refers to are held by foreigners. Using Trump’s logic, Obama can claim credit for gains on his watch, too From Obama’s inauguration through Oct. 12, 2009, the Standard & Poor’s index increased by a whopping 34 percent, outpacing Trump’s 19 percent over the same portion of his presidency. The circumstances were different, of course -- Obama started at an economic low point while Trump inherited a healthily growing economy -- but the economy went on to strengthen under Obama over the long term. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the final quarter of 2016, Americans’ net worth increased from $55 trillion to $92 trillion. (This figure encompasses stock market values, home and property values, and changes in the indebtedness of U.S. households.) That’s an increase of two-thirds over eight years, or $37 trillion in raw dollars. So under Obama, wealth increased by an amount four times as large as the increase in the federal debt. But, for the reasons we explained, the wealth gains could not be directly applied to reduce the debt. "By President Trump's own reasoning, the Obama administration was an enormous success," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "The success has continued, so far, in the first nine months of the Trump administration." In the meantime, some argue that the creation of certain types of debt under Obama -- the deficit-financed expenditures for the fiscal stimulus during the Great Recession, for instance -- helped produce the stock-price run-up under both Obama and Trump. "One could argue that without the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the economy would have been far weaker in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and stock market valuations would have been lower," Lafakis said. "So in that instance, increasing the debt helped the stock market." Our ruling Trump said the Obama administration "borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. ... Maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt." Trump seems to be signaling that the stock market gains can somehow be applied to paying down the debt. That’s not the case -- gains from a bull market accrue to stockholders, and the government doesn’t get its fractional cut until the assets are sold and taxed, if they ever are. So, whatever tax revenues from the stock-market run-up eventually flow to the government over the course of many years won’t make a dent in the debt, economists say. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12456	In the House Republican health care bill, "we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/may/09/barry-loudermilk/would-gop-bill-expand-womens-health-care-curbing-p/	Moments after the House passed a bill to significantly overhaul the nation’s health care system, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., blasted an email to constituents. While the bill "doesn’t fix the entire problem," he said, it "begins the process of fixing our broken health care system." A PolitiFact reader sent us a copy of Loudermilk’s email and asked us to fact-check it. We zeroed in on one of the exchanges in a "frequently asked questions" section that sought to explain some of the bill’s provisions: "Why are you cutting women’s health services?" "We’re not. In fact, we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics." Could pushing Planned Parenthood out of the picture really expand women’s access to health care? We found that there are indeed more community health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics -- but that doesn’t mean that redirecting dollars to them will amount to "expanding women’s access to health services." Some background The GOP health care bill bill would effectively block Planned Parenthood for a year from securing reimbursements from Medicaid -- not just for abortions, which is already the case, but for any services, from pap smears to birth control. Planned Parenthood says abortion services are already walled off from payments they get for services that have nothing to do with abortion. But abortion opponents have long argued that the government is tacitly supporting abortion even by reimbursing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services, saying such money is fungible once it reaches Planned Parenthood’s coffers. The bill’s change could have a significant impact on Planned Parenthood: About 43 percent of the group’s budget comes from the government, including grants and reimbursements, much of which comes from Medicaid. The group says the bill, if enacted, could lead to closures of clinics and leave women without access to vital services, especially in medically underserved areas. Do community health centers "vastly outnumber" Planned Parenthood clinics? Loudermilk has a point on the numbers of clinics. We looked at a census of clinics that provide contraceptive services published in April 2017 by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health nonprofit. The group tallied up various types of clinics, the most numerous of which are "federally qualified health centers" -- defined by the federal government as "safety-net providers that primarily provide services typically furnished in an outpatient clinic." Such facilities can include community health centers, migrant health centers, homeless health care centers, and public housing primary care centers. For 2015, the census tallied 5,829 federally qualified health centers nationally, compared to 676 Planned Parenthood clinics. That’s a ratio of greater than 8-to-1, so the adjective "vastly" seems appropriate. Would the bill redirect money from Planned Parenthood to community health centers? Not necessarily. Planned Parenthood received about $553.7 million from the government in 2015 for its services; the group, however, does not make public what portion of that is specifically from the federal government because the funding streams from different levels of government are sometimes hard to disentangle. The best estimate we can get comes from the Congressional Budget Office, which projected that the provision blocking federal funding to Planned Parenthood would result in $178 million in reduced federal outlays. If the CBO’s projection is accurate, then the increase in federal funding to community health centers in the bill -- $422 million -- would represent a larger federal investment than the money being held back from Planned Parenthood. At first glance, that would seem to make the bill a net expansion in dollars, if you consider only these two line items. However, a couple issues balance against the notion that that this will represent an expansion of care. First, there is no guarantee that the $422 million spent would go towards the same patients, and for the same services, that would be lost due to the Planned Parenthood cuts. The bill does not explicitly require that. Another caveat comes from a different conclusion in the same CBO analysis. "To the extent that there would be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they would affect services that help women avert pregnancies," CBO wrote. "The people most likely to experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations. CBO projects that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care." The immediate loss of care for 15 percent of Planned Parenthood patients also undercuts the argument that money would simply flow from one type of clinic to the other. Would redirecting funding to these centers expand women’s access to health services? There’s reason to be skeptical. For starters, common sense suggests that even if community health centers ended up being able to serve every single patient currently served by Planned Parenthood, that wouldn’t qualify as "expanding women’s access to health services" -- it would simply be maintaining it. The closure of as many as 676 Planned Parenthood facilities would require an awful lot of expansion of resources elsewhere just to keep pace, before any "expansion" of access begins. And there’s reason to believe that community health centers may not be able to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood centers disappear. First, there’s a capacity problem. Planned Parenthood centers tend to be unusually efficient in providing health services to women, because that’s their specialty. The average Planned Parenthood clinic served 2,950 patients for contraceptive services in 2015, compared to 320 for the average federally qualified health center, according to the Guttmacher census. "Because by definition health centers are in medically underserved communities with elevated risk and insufficient primary care, the last thing one does is get rid of any supply," Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, told PolitiFact. "This is the corker. Health centers are overwhelmed with need." And currently, community health centers are already operating with a shortage of staff, making any rapid expansion that much trickier. "Workforce challenges are one of the primary barriers to health center patient growth," the National Association of Community Health Centers concluded in a 2016 report on its sector. "If all health center clinical vacancies were filled today, health centers could serve 2 million more patients." And second, community health centers and Planned Parenthood clinics aren’t interchangeable, experts say. Guttmacher data indicates that Planned Parenthood centers "are considerably more likely to offer a broad range of contraceptive methods than sites operated by other types of agencies. Nearly all Planned Parenthood health centers offer the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved reversible contraceptive methods," compared to half of federally qualified health centers. Rebecca Kreitzer, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recently told the Atlantic that oral contraceptives and condoms are cheap enough that community health clinics can afford to give them out and then request federal reimbursement, but IUDs and contraceptive implants -- two long-term but reversible methods -- are often too expensive for clinics to front without immediate payment. By contrast, Planned Parenthood is a big enough network that it can afford to provide more expensive methods immediately. Because of this, Planned Parenthood clinics are also likelier to have staff on hand with the requisite expertise. "Just because there is a federally qualified health center near where there is a Planned Parenthood Clinic does not mean we can assume the women going to Planned Parenthood would easily be served," said Keith J. Mueller, head of the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Iowa. When the Atlantic investigated how prepared Iowa health clinics were to pick up patients from Planned Parenthood, they found that lists of clinics provided by Republican lawmakers included "a dentist’s office, a school nurse, and a youth shelter" as well as one clinic that had closed and several that didn’t provide family-planning services. "They're assuming we're the alternative," Ted Boesen, CEO of the non-profit Iowa Primary Care Association, told the magazine. "But we're waiting to see what kind of a scale it is." Finally, the Energy and Commerce Committee said it’s possible to argue "that Planned Parenthood provides inferior overall service because they cannot offer holistic care to their patients, as they are a boutique reproductive health provider." But experts say the committee’s emphasis on full-spectrum health care is more expensive than reproductive health care "Because health centers must think about the full spectrum of primary health care for all patients, the absence of a specialized safety-net provider such as Planned Parenthood would be deeply problematic," Rosenbaum has written. "When health centers attempt to respond to a surge in demand, they must think about not just the specialized services lost, but all of the health needs of the patients who find their way to a health center, not to mention those of their families. … As a result, the anticipated cost per patient served is far higher than family planning and related services alone." In other words, the higher cost of providing care at community health centers is another reason why the increased federal funding figure in the bill may not be sufficient for replacing the lost Planned Parenthood services. Our ruling Loudermilk said that in the House Republican health care bill, "we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics." Purely on the numbers, he has a point that there are more federally qualified health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics. But the notion that bypassing Planned Parenthood would mean "expanding" access is dubious. Challenges of geography, capacity, specialization and cost raise significant questions about whether existing centers, even if they were provided with Planned Parenthood’s federal revenue stream, would be able to maintain the current patient load, much less expand it. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-15169	Says Scott Walker's plan to replace Obamacare "is a new entitlement" program for "every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/26/bobby-jindal/scott-walkers-obamacare-replacement-new-entitlemen/	The day Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his proposal to replace Obamacare, one of his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination jumped all over him. No, it wasn't Donald Trump. The attack came from Bobby Jindal, who has trailed Trump, Walker and other Republicans in presidential preference polls. In a nine-paragraph statement issued Aug. 18, 2015, the Louisiana governor called Walker's proposal an entitlement program -- seven times. A featured punch line: "In Governor Walker’s plan, a new entitlement is created for every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare." So, is Walker proposing what amounts to a new entitlement program -- and for every American human being? Setting the table Let's set out a couple of markers before we dig in. 1. Walker's 14-page proposal is essentially in outline form. It is a political document rather than a formal program. The Christian Science Monitor -- noting that health care expert Avik Roy estimated Walker’s proposal would cost about $1.1 trillion over 10 years -- observed that the plan "devotes only two sentences to outlining how this might be paid for." (Obamacare is expected to cost $1.2 trillion, according to a March 2015 estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.) 2. There is some subjectivity in the term entitlement; it doesn't have a legal definition. At the same time, what constitutes an entitlement is well-established at the federal level. Defining entitlement A federal entitlement program gives benefits to everyone who qualifies -- without regard to how much, in total, the benefits will cost the government. That is, for most government programs, spending is limited to the amount that has been appropriated by Congress. But for entitlements, there is no predetermined limit -- the government spends whatever is necessary to provide the promised benefits to every eligible person who claims them. More formally, "A Glossary of Political Economy Terms" by Auburn University political scientist Paul Johnson, says an entitlement program "provides individuals with personal financial benefits to which an indefinite number of potential beneficiaries have a legal right whenever they meet eligibility conditions" specified by the law that authorizes the program. The glossary lists Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- as well as most Veterans' Administration programs, unemployment compensation and food stamps -- as being among the most important federal entitlements. Obamacare's entitlement Tax credits are one benefit offered under Obamacare. They are an entitlement, Harvard University economist and health care expert David Cutler told us. Anyone with moderate income who isn't eligible for coverage through an employer can get the subsidies, which are used toward the cost of buying insurance from the health insurance marketplace. The amounts vary depending on an individual's or family's income, as well as where they live. Place of residence helps take into account how the cost of coverage can vary by region. Walker's plan Walker’s proposal, called "The Day One Patient Freedom Plan," doesn’t use the word entitlement, of course. But Walker also would provide tax credits to people who do not have employer-based coverage, saying they would make health insurance more affordable and more portable. Those credits are what Jindal highlighted in his statement. Walker's credits differ from Obama's in that the amounts would be based only on age, not income or other factors. The plan says that, for example, a 35-year-old woman who makes $35,000 per year and has no children now gets nothing in Obamacare subsidies "because she’s too young and too middle class." But under Walker’s plan, she would get a $2,100 tax credit "that she could use to shop for insurance in the open market and put any savings into a health savings account." Several experts, from across the political spectrum, agreed that Walker's credits are an entitlement. Roy, in a blog post published in the conservative National Review the day after Walker's plan was released, used that word explicitly. "The core of Walker’s approach is a new, universal entitlement that every legal U.S. resident would be eligible for, regardless of income or need," wrote Roy, who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative New York think tank, and the opinion editor at Forbes. Economist Henry Aaron, a health care expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C., told us that compared to Obamacare, Walker's plan would cost less and provide lesser benefits. But both sets of credits are are entitlements, he said. And Robert Kraig, executive director of the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin, said Walker’s program would be a broader entitlement than Obamacare because the tax credits would be available regardless of income to anyone up to age 65 who does not have employer-based health coverage. Still, Jindal's claim goes too far. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, agreed that Walker's tax credits are an entitlement. But he pointed out that they aren't necessarily new, since they're essentially the same, if smaller, than credits provided by the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, Jindal claims everyone would get Walker’s entitlement, when it would only apply to people who don’t get health insurance from their employer. Walker's campaign initially didn't address Jindal's claim, instead sending us articles in which conservatives praised the plan. But in a follow-up email, campaign spokeswoman Stacy Day said defining an entitlement as a financial benefit that everyone who qualifies for would get, without regard to the total cost of the government, is too broad. "Take a deduction approach, as some support," she wrote, "Under the definition you offered, any individual who qualifies for his health insurance deduction would receive the deduction without regard to the total cost to the government -- in this case, a reduction in the government's tax revenues. Moreover, there is no set appropriation for a deduction, the total amount spent would be determined by how many people are eligible for the deduction. Under this unreasonably broad definition of entitlement, all tax preferences would be entitlements. This is just not correct." That belies the example provided in Walker's own plan, where a person, regardless of income or other factors, would receive $2,100 in tax credits. As well as a consensus among the experts we spoke with that, like the Obamacare tax credits, Walker's credits are an entitlement. Our rating Jindal said Walker's plan to replace Obamacare "is a new entitlement" program for "every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare." Walker’s proposal includes tax credits to help people buy coverage in the private market. The credits would be available to everyone up to age 65 -- without regard to income or other requirements -- but only if they don’t get health insurance from their employer. The credits aren't entirely new, however, as they are similar to those provided under Obamacare. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

pomt-01438	"When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-deficit-fell-10-percent-gdp-3-pe/	During a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014, President Barack Obama offered a rosy -- if cautious -- view on the state of the economy. One of the statistics he touted was this one: "When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent." We wondered if he was correct. We looked at data from the Office of Management and Budget that tracks the federal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. Calculating it this way shows not the absolute level of the deficit but rather how big it is in relation to the size of the broader economy. The data shows that for fiscal year 2009, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 9.8 percent, while the projected percentage for fiscal year 2014 is 3.7 percent. But the timing of the Office of Management and Budget figures don’t coincide with Obama taking office. The 9.8 percent figure covers fiscal year 2009 -- which runs from Oct. 1, 2008, to Sept. 31, 2009. In other words, it covers a little less than four months of President George W. Bush’s second term, and nearly eight months of Obama’s first term. In other words, the figure looks at an entire year that covers two presidencies -- not a snapshot on the day Obama took office, Jan. 20, 2009. That casts some doubt about the accuracy of how Obama framed the issue. Obama said, "When I took office," which suggests that he inherited his predecessor’s deficit at nearly 10 percent of GDP and should get the credit for reducing it. The reality is that if Obama is going to claim some credit for reducing the deficit, he should also take some responsibility for pushing the deficit up to nearly 10 percent of GDP in his first fiscal year in office. Part of the reason the deficit was relatively high was because of the recession-fighting stimulus bill, which Obama championed. The deficit-to-GDP percentage for the fiscal year prior, 2008, was 3.1 percent. This gives a sense of what Obama inherited -- but it’s not a perfectly useful number, either, because it stops almost four months before Obama took office. During those four months, the economy was worsening rapidly, and spending on the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- which aimed to stabilize the financial sector -- had begun adding to the deficit. So if one could figure out a percentage for the day Obama was inaugurated -- which actually can’t be done -- it would likely be somewhere between 3.1 percent and 9.8 percent. There’s another wrinkle in comparing deficits to the economy overall and then trying to take credit for improvements. While it’s relatively easy to assign credit or blame for government spending, which helps shape the size of the country’s deficit, it is not nearly as easy to credit or blame Obama for the overall state of the economy as measured by GDP. "The impact of a president on the economy is tough to measure," said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. "So taking credit for a normalizing economy and the associated normalizing of the budget deficit is generally pushing it in my book." The transition from Bush to Obama is especially tough to parse, as these past PolitiFact articles show. The White House argued to PolitiFact that the deficit projected at the beginning of his first term, once you factor out the pricetag for the stimulus and related debt service, was 9.2 percent for fiscal year 2009. Looking at it this way has merit, but for a retrospective claim like this, we think it’s worth giving credence to hard numbers over initial projections. And we’d reiterate that some of the spending that took place before he was inaugurated, such as TARP, had the support of then-President-Elect Obama. "It would have been better for him to say, ‘In my first year in office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of GDP,’ " said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Our ruling Obama said, "When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent." Actually, the deficit reached 10 percent of the economy several months after Obama took office, not on his first day. Obama is laying the blame for the high deficit-to-GDP ratio entirely on Bush, when the figure covers time in office for both presidents. In reality, the numbers are more nuanced than he lets on, and his formulation oversimplifies the factors that played into these trends, some of which he had control over and some of which he didn’t. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-10-06T15:49:39	2014-10-02	['None']

That’s according to Men’s Corner, a website that claims to provide "a measured dose of humor" and "the latest information from all the fields which can be significant for the modern man." The article doesn’t have a date but the earliest comment is from Oct. 7, 2017, and it was recently revived on social media. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Man dug tunnel from home to the pub and drank every night while his wife slept," the headline says. The determined human excavator’s name is Patsy K., according to Men’s Corner. He is a plumber from Omagh, in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, who was inspired to build his own secret tunnel after watching the 1994 film, "The Shawshank Redemption." In that movie, an inmate played by actor Tim Robbins methodically burrows a tunnel out of the prison to find freedom. According to Men’s Corner, Patsy K. spent 15 years burrowing under his bed to his local bar 800 meters away. His stunt was discovered after he accidentally hit a sewage pipe, causing it to blow under his neighbor’s house. That’s when Patsy K. received a court summons, the story says. Using a form provided on Men’s Corner’s website under "Contact Us," we sent an email seeking more information about the story. Someone replied under the name "Tesanj Teslic," which are towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "Hi Ciara, I work for Men’s Corner," the person wrote. "This is an old post, the source we used no longer exists for some reason, so it can turn out that this story is not quite true. But you can check in the Omagh County Court (Northern Ireland) where this allegedly happened." A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunal Service Press Team said officials couldn’t search for current or disposed cases without the full name of the defendant, the court that they appeared and the time period when the case would’ve been heard. Other stories give the plumber’s full name as "Patsy Kerr," but it’s unclear what court may have heard his case. The Police Service of Northern Ireland responded to an email inquiry and asked for more details about the alleged plumber’s crime but did not immediately provide more information about this story. Variations of the story appear online, including on Tyrone Tribulations, a website that notes "accuracy cannot be guaranteed." Buzzfeed posted its own version in 2014, replete with a gif of Tim Robbins standing with his arms outstretched in the rain. "This man dug a tunnel to the pub using a spoon," the headline said.

pomt-15274	Since 2009, "we've cut homelessness (among veterans) by a third."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/28/barack-obama/obama-says-veteran-homelessness-has-been-cut-third/	Ever since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized the war record of Vietnam veteran Sen. John McCain on July 20, the treatment of veterans has been a major point of political discussion. President Barack Obama got into the fray in his July 21 interview with Jon Stewart on the Comedy Central program The Daily Show, during an unaired, exclusively online portion of the interview. Stewart questioned Obama on the state of veteran health care, citing, among other things, the VA’s long wait times. Obama defended the government agency, claiming the VA is structurally better than when he entered office, though it remains underfunded and its employees overworked. Later in the interview, he further defended his record when it comes to serving veterans. "Let’s take something like homelessness among veterans. So we’ve cut that by a third," Obama said. That one-third number struck us. Does Obama have the facts to back it up? One independent agency dedicated to fighting homelessness thinks so. On the "Veterans" page of the National Alliance to End Homelessness’ website, it reads, "In 2009, the Obama Administration committed to ending veteran homelessness in the U.S. by the end of 2015. Since 2010, there has been a 33 percent decrease in the number of homeless veterans." Nan Roman, the CEO and president of the Alliance, said the 33 percent decrease is backed by the yearly "point in time," called PIT, count of homeless veterans. Every year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) releases a detailed report about the state of homelessness in the United States to Congress, called the Annual Homeless Assessment Report. The 2014 report reported 49,933 homeless veterans according to the point in time count, a 32.57 percent decrease from the 2009 count of 74,050. The 2015 numbers are not yet available, but Roman said she expects further decreases. National "point in time" counts were first conducted in 2009, during the peak of the recession, so it is possible that the decline in homelessness among veterans has been symptomatic of the larger national economic recovery. But the count has been largely consistent since then. But what is a "point in time" count, and what do other metrics say about veteran homelessness? According to Dennis Culhane, a professor who studies homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania, the PIT count is conducted around the same time every year by individual cities. The number is supposed to reflect the total number of homeless people, "sheltered" and "unsheltered," on a given night in a given city. Cities must do a count if they are to receive HUD funding. The "sheltered" count is easy. When homeless people stay in temporary, government-sponsored housing, they have to register with city officials. It’s the "unsheltered" population, the people living on the street, who pose a counting challenge According to Culhane, not every city counts the same way. Some literally count by hand the number of homeless people living on the street. Some estimate based on how likely it is to find a homeless person in a given area of a city. And some even change their counting methodology from year to year, forcing revised estimates that can change the national number. Despite some inevitable discrepancies, Roman said the PIT numbers are consistent. "They may be imperfect, but they’re imperfect in the same way every single year," Roman said. Further complicating things, it can be difficult to ascertain whether certain unsheltered homeless people are veterans. Sometimes, those who have served do not identify as such, or, on the flip side, people exaggerate their service. The PIT count also isn’t the only statistic for counting the homeless veteran population. Brian Sullivan, the supervisory public affairs specialist at HUD, pointed us to both the PIT number and the one-year estimate of sheltered veterans, a different metric. That number isn’t limited by the small time frame of the PIT count. It uses an entire year’s worth of data. The one-year estimate of sheltered veterans does not support the 33 percent number Obama offered. According to the most recent data, there were just 6.5 percent fewer homeless veterans from 2009 to 2013. But Roman and Culhane say the PIT number is preferred over the one-year estimate because the PIT takes into account both sheltered and unsheltered veterans. "I would use the PIT count. Annual data would be strong, if they included all veterans (i.e., unsheltered as well as sheltered)," Roman wrote in an email. "Over one-third of the homeless veteran population is unsheltered on a given night. That is a large percentage of the population to ignore." Culhane said the biggest drop in the homeless veteran population has been among the unsheltered, so ignoring that slice of the population would be counterintuitive. The only reason to be skeptical of the Annual Homeless Assessment Report numbers, Roman said, would be because they are pretty much the only numbers available. "It’s the administration reporting on the administration’s data, and we don’t have any verification of it," Roman said. Culhane, who helps with the count as the director of research for the VA’s National Center for Homelessness Among Veterans, said there were multiple reasons to believe the numbers. For one, he pointed out, individual communities conduct the counts. For another, Obama and Congress together have thrown a lot of money at this problem in recent years. "In 2009, the federal budget for veteran homelessness was $400 million and that paid for a transitional housing program that was basically a fancy shelter," he said. "Now the budget is $1.5 billion." Roman agreed. "There’s a lot of work going on in communities to find every veteran, and there’s a lot of money being spent to get them into housing," she said. She pointed to the Supportive Services for Veterans Families and HUD-VA Supportive Housing programs, which have both cut down significantly on the cost of housing for homeless veterans. Our ruling Obama said, "Let’s take something like homelessness among veterans. So we’ve cut that by a third." According to the most recent, best available data, he’s right. During his tenure, homelessness among veterans has decreased 32.57 percent. However, that number is based on estimates that have an element of uncertainty. Also, funding to end homelessness among veterans has received bipartisan support in Congress. Still, Obama’s point is largely accurate, and we rate his statement Mostly True.

An ad released on Oct. 11 paid for and authorized by Friends of Christine O'Donnell, seeks to turn the focus on her opponent, Democrat Chris Coons. In a minute-long ad featuring dark, horror-movie visuals and spooky music, O'Donnell portrays Coons -- the county executive of Delaware's populous New Castle County -- as a roving psychopath that she dubs "The Taxman." Coons, the narrator intones, "is taxing everything out here." The ad makes several charges about Coons raising specific taxes. We'll take up one claim in another item -- that Coons proposed hiking property taxes by about 50 percent. This article will focus on a claim regarding taxes for 911 emergency service. Efforts to reach the O'Donnell campaign were unsuccessful. The ad phrases this claim in two slightly different ways. The narrator says that Coons "thought that a 911 call should be taxed." And as the narrator says that, the screen shows the text: "Proposed a 911 Cell Phone Fee." Before we critique the ad's accuracy, let's provide some background on the financing of 911 services, provided by Brian Fontes, the chief executive of the National Emergency Number Association, the group that represents 911 call centers and the vendors who service them. In theory, 911 services can simply be funded through a jurisdiction's general tax revenues, and in some places that is what's done. But more commonly, jurisdictions use either a tariff (that is, a levy approved by a telephone regulatory commission) or a fee (a levy often approved by an elected body such as a city council, a county council or a state legislature). Either way, the tariff or the fee appears as a line item on a customer's phone bill. Typically, users will see a standard amount assessed each month on any phone registered in a given jurisdiction. Fontes said that these levies tend not to be officially referred to as a "tax," but we think it's fair for O'Donnell to characterize it that way, since we expect most people wouldn't know what a 911 "tariff" is. As cell phones have become more common, they have overtaken land lines in the number of calls made to 911. That is especially true now because most cell phones can electronically route a call directly to the appropriate local 911 line, even if the phone is registered out of state. Nationally, Fontes said, cell phones make about 60 percent of 911 calls, and that percentage is growing by the year. In a 2007 story, Delaware's biggest newspaper, the Wilmington News Journal, quoted Dave Roberts, New Castle County's chief of emergency communications, saying that instead of getting "one or two calls on an incident on the turnpike, now we get 20 to 30 calls," he said. "When people see an emergency like that, they want to play their part." It's helpful, Roberts added, because some witnesses will have information that others missed, such as the color or model of a fleeing car. This has had an impact on how jurisdictions pay for 911 services. Since cell phones are a relatively recent invention, jurisdictions have had to write new laws or regulations to finance 911 calls through levies on cell phones, rather than just longstanding 911 fees on landlines. That's what happened in New Castle County in 2007. In early 2007, when Coons was assembling his county's budget proposal, he told the Wilmington News Journal in a March 17, 2007, article that "he plans to approach the General Assembly this spring for authority to create new revenue streams, such as a hotel tax, a 911 cell-phone fee and a paramedic-service fee." (Coons wouldn't have been able to implement the fee on his own -- it needed approval of the state legislature.) Later News Journal stories elaborated on the details. Coons wanted to increase the existing 911 excise tax on landlines from 60 cents a month to $1.00 and to impose, for the first time, a $1.00 monthly excise tax for 911 on cell phones. The newspaper quoted estimates that this could raise $3 million a year. The law passed in 2007. So where does O'Donnell's ad fit into this? The ad is correct that Coons proposed a tax to fund 911 services. But it adds some layers of obfuscation to this grain of truth. First, the ad is misleading when it implies that Coons strode into a tax-free oasis of 911 service and decided to impose a tax for the first time. Landlines had long been taxed to support 911 service. What Coons did was extend the tax to cell phones after their use to call 911 surged. Second, and probably more important, the ad is misleading about what exactly Coons proposed to do. The ad says that Chris Coons "thought that a 911 call should be taxed." We think most people would understand that to mean that every time they dialed 911, they would be hit by a tax. But that's not the case. Instead, Coons' proposed tax would have been a monthly levy on each user's bill, regardless of whether someone called 911 or not. No one needed to worry that calling 911 to help an injured motorist on the highway would lead to a special fee on their next phone bill. O'Donnell's ad twisted the details of a proposed 911 levy to fit her image of Coons as an insatiable tax monster. Yes, he proposed a tax, but for a service on which other phones already were being taxed. And Coons most certainly did not propose taxing individual 911 calls. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12544	"The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/18/donald-trump/trump-falsely-claims-obama-policies-blame-growth-m/	President Donald Trump blamed former President Barack Obama on Twitter for the formation of one of the most notorious gangs. "The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!" Trump tweeted April 18. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet came days after four young men were found brutally murdered in Central Islip in Long Island. The Suffolk County police commissioner said he suspects the MS-13 involvement. But the president’s post about the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 gang, is misleading. The gang was established in Los Angeles and spread across the country decades before Obama took office. Trump’s administration has conducted target operations to arrest criminals, but data is not yet available on how many MS-13 gang members have been arrested or removed. Ioan Grillo, author of the 2016 book Gangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields, and the New Politics of Latin America, disputed Trump’s conclusion. "I have seen no evidence that the Obama administration can can be blamed in any way for the existence or activities of the gang in the U.S.," Grillo told PolitiFact. We asked a Trump spokesman for more information but did not hear back by deadline. MS-13 history and growth predates Obama policy Violent gangs, including MS-13, were forming in U.S. cities long before Obama’s presidency. MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. (The name Mara Salvatrucha comes from the word "mara" which is a term for gang, "salva" for El Salvador and "trucha," which is slang for clever.) It later spread to other parts of the United States and in Central American nations. By the end of the 1990s, the United States government recognized that MS-13 posed a significant criminal threat. Amid an immigration crackdown toward the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency, the government launched an effort to deport foreign-born residents convicted of crimes, including gang members. In the mid 2000s, U.S. agencies including the FBI and ICE launched initiatives to combat the growth of gangs. There were several news reports about MS-13’s proliferation in the United States during the 2000s, with interest growing after a 2006 National Geographic documentary on the "World’s Most Dangerous Gang." The documentary showed that by the end of the 1990s, the gang had groups in almost every state. Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed MS-13 on the same day as Trump’s tweet, blaming "an open border and years of lax immigration enforcement" for MS-13 recruitment. Multiple experts said there is no evidence that Obama policies caused the growth of Latino gangs in the United States. "The big surge was during Bush-Cheney when the drivers of illegal migration in Central America grew, when various crackdowns on crime-filled prisons to bursting point, and when funding for rehabilitation programs declined," said Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. Armstrong formerly worked as a national intelligence officer for Latin America, chief of staff of the CIA’s crime and narcotics center, and was a career CIA officer. The growth of MS-13 in the United States is related to draconian domestic policies in the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador) that have pushed many gang members out of Central America, said Florida International University professor Jose Miguel Cruz. Héctor Silva Ávalos, a research fellow at American University, said that there has been a new peak in gang activities on the East Coast since 2014 -- especially in Long Island and Montgomery County, Md. "But this has to do with gang dynamics that have been brewing back in Central America since the Mauricio Funes administration in El Salvador (2009-14) brokered a truce with both MS-13 and Barrio 18," he said. "It is not related to U.S. internal policy." Elana Zilberg, a University of California San Diego communications professor, said Obama specifically targeted "criminal" aliens (including MS-13 members) in his aggressive deportation program. "However, Trump’s tweet might be a blunt allusion to Obama’s position on unaccompanied minors from Central America," she said. "That, however, was a policy inherited from the Bush administration." The number of Central American children coming alone began to increase in fiscal year 2012 and rose significantly in 2014. The Obama administration in 2014 announced a series of new programs and partnerships with Central American countries to address the issues driving their migration. The Central American Minors program allowed certain parents with lawful presence in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for admission as refugees but at risk of harm could be admitted under parole. The program was expanded in 2016 to allow additional family members to apply. No data on MS-13 removals under Trump Trump lauded his administration’s enforcement efforts in a Fox News interview that aired shortly after his tweet. "We’ve gotten tremendous criminals out of this country," Trump said on Fox & Friends. "I'm talking about illegal immigrants that were here that caused tremendous crime that have murdered people, raped people, horrible things have happened. They are getting the hell out, or they are going to prison." Trump claimed nothing had been done to remove criminals until he came along. (Here is an overview of some targeted enforcement operations during the Obama administration that led to the arrests of criminals and gang members.) "It is a serious problem and we never did anything about it, and now we're doing something about it," Trump said. But ICE data available so far do not prove that Trump is removing MS-13 members "fast" as he tweeted. In February, the Trump administration said it had conducted targeted operations resulting in the arrest of more than 680 people, including gang members. At least one of them was a self-admitted MS-13 gang member from El Salvador. A unit within ICE tracks MS-13 arrests, but monthly data on gang and MS-13 arrests during Trump’s time in office is not available. From fiscal years 2005 through 2016, immigration officials made 7,051 MS-13 arrests, ICE said. ICE removal data shows how many individuals were suspected or confirmed gang members. But it does not say to which gang they were affiliated. In fiscal year 2016, ICE removed 240,255 individuals and 2,057 were suspected or confirmed gang members, the agency reported. During the full two months that Trump has been in office (February and March), a total of 36,467 individuals have been removed, according to an ICE official. ICE said it did not have information on how many of them were gang members. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com An executive order signed by Trump expanded removal priorities to include immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of crimes as well as those who have been charged with a criminal offense but not yet convicted. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!" MS-13 gangs in the United States were established decades before Obama took office and had been spreading across the U.S. long before his tenure. Experts told us there is no evidence Obama policies spurred their growth. Finally, Obama prioritized the deportation of criminal immigrants. Immigration officials told us data on how many MS-13 gang members have been arrested and removed under Trump’s administration is not available. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-12651	"South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing."	true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/23/habitat-humanity-broward/does-south-florida-lead-nation-gap-between-wages-a/	South Florida’s housing market spans the gamut of tony gated oceanfront mansions for millionaires and some downtrodden neighborhoods. That’s not unusual for a major urban area. But is it worse in South Florida than elsewhere in the nation? Habitat for Humanity painted a stark picture about the cost of housing in South Florida in a press release announcing that President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, retired Dr. Ben Carson, will visit the site of a future affordable housing development in Broward County on March 24. "Studies indicate that while Broward County is the most cost-burdened housing market in the nation, South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing," said the affordable home-building organization that partners with volunteers. We will focus on whether South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing. The phrase "cost-burdened" refers to households that spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. People who spend more than 50 percent are considered "severely cost-burdened." South Florida housing market Habitat for Humanity cited a few different reports about the lack of affordable housing in South Florida. A key report included information from the Center for Neighborhood Technology along with the Center for Housing Policy, a division of the National Housing Conference. The 2012 report outlined the struggle for moderate-income families to afford housing in the 25 largest metro areas. Researchers examined data between 2006-10 from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The report found that housing and transportation costs rose faster than income nationally, although the disparity was greater in some metro areas than others. And South Florida topped that list. In the Miami metro area, 40 percent of income for a moderate-income household was spent on housing, more than any other metro area in the study. (The Miami metropolitan statistical area was defined by the federal government at the time as stretching from Miami-Dade County, through Broward and north up to West Palm Beach.) It was followed by the Riverside, Calif., metro area and the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. More recent research shows that the Miami metro area continues to lag behind in affordable housing, said Janet Viveiros, acting director of research at the National Housing Conference. "Low- and moderate-income households, even those who are working, still face serious challenges in accessing affordable homeownership or renting in the Miami metro area," she said. The organization’s "Housing Landscape" report based on data from 2011-2014 found that 35.8 percent of low- and moderate-income working households in the Miami area spent more than half their income on housing. That was only exceeded -- slightly -- by the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif., area, which had 36.4 percent of those households spending that much on housing. (This report covered the 50 largest metro areas.) A study by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies in 2015 found Miami had the largest share of cost-burdened renters of any major metro in the country. An NYU Furman Center/CapitalOne report in 2016 reached a similar conclusion. While metro areas with higher rents also had higher incomes, Miami "pops out as a troubling exception—a high-cost city without high incomes." Anne Ray, a researcher at the University of Florida’s Shimberg Center for Housing Studies, said that data continues to show that Miami housing costs are unattainable for low-income people. "Rent is very high and the median income is much lower, particularly in Miami-Dade, than other expensive markets," Ray said. Our ruling Habitat for Humanity says, "South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing." Studies have repeatedly shown that South Florida tops the list in the gap between wages and housing. Although there are other metro areas with similarly expensive housing, wages lag behind in South Florida. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04394	Says Connie Mack takes two homestead exemptions, "directly contrary to Florida’s Constitution."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/bill-nelson/mack-gets-one-florida/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV sparred over personal tax breaks during their only U.S. Senate debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie. Mack cried moo early on during the Oct. 17, 2012, match, hitting Nelson for taking a greenbelt assessment on a family pasture because he allows a half-dozen cows to graze there. Nelson’s retort came a bit later, when a reporter-panelist asked if he supported amnesty for illegal immigrants. "I’m going to answer that in detail," Nelson said, "but I’m first going to say not only has it been a cow pasture for 60 years, (but) why don’t we ask him why he takes two homestead exemptions, which is directly contrary to Florida’s Constitution that says that a husband and wife can only take one homestead exemption?" Mack has faced heat over his homestead exemption since the primary, when former U.S. Sen. George LeMieux claimed he was a California resident who lives with his wife, U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack. We rated that Mostly False. Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin elaborated on Nelson’s comments after the debate, saying what Nelson meant is that "Mack is part of a family unit that has two homestead exemptions." He pointed to Florida’s Constitution, which says, "Not more than one exemption shall be allowed any individual or family unit or with respect to any residential unit." Some quick background: Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004; he filed for divorce from his wife Ann in 2005; and two years later, he married U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., the widow of singer and U.S. Rep. Sonny Bono. When Mack announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in 2011, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that he had been criticized for not spending time in Florida. According to the story, "Mack said he and his wife spend time together in Washington and then usually go separate ways on the weekend — the opposite situation from other lawmakers. Another incentive to be in Florida, he said: an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son from his first marriage are in the state." The U.S. Constitution requires Senate candidates to be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years and a resident of the state when elected. Florida’s election code doesn’t define residency, but the courts have defined legal residence to mean a permanent residence, according to a 1993 advisory opinion by the state Division of Elections. Mack gets a homestead exemption for a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo in Fort Myers, Lee County property records show. His time at the home has been questioned by political opponents and also by his ex-wife, who said in a 2005 divorce court filing that Mack bought it to "solely to assist his political career" when he was running in the congressional district for the area. The Mack campaign has disputed her account. The Tampa Tribune raised more questions in February 2012, reporting that Mack’s current wife gets an exemption on her California home on top of Mack’s homestead break for his condo. The Tribune quoted William D. Shepherd, general counsel for the Hillsborough County property appraiser’s office, as saying the Macks should not collect two homestead exemptions because they are operating as a "family unit," and Florida law says one homestead exemption per unit. Under Florida law, Mack is entitled to the exemption if he can prove his finances aren’t co-mingled with those of his wife. Mack campaign spokesman David James told the Miami Herald in February that Mack meets that criteria: "They file separate returns, do not have joint accounts, and Connie’s name is not on Mary’s home in California, and Mary’s is not on Connie’s home in Fort Myers," James said. Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson looked into the legality of Mack’s homestead after the media attention about it. His verdict: "Connie is entitled to the homestead here." "He provided the documentation, and our attorneys looked at it, and it is proper," Wilkinson told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. Wilkinson said he could not get into specifics about Mack’s case, but he emphasized that Mack had to clear "very stringent hoops" to get the homestead after the review "or I would not have agreed." Further, he said he does not think the intent of homestead laws is to prevent members of Congress from getting married. If Connie Mack or Mary Bono Mack had to give up their homesteads, they may be at risk of losing the residency requirement for Congress. James said Nelson can’t back up his debate claim. "The Lee County assessor has approved Connie Mack's one and only homestead in Fort Myers, the only home he owns," James wrote in a statement after the debate. Shepherd said he still disagrees with Mack receiving the exemption. Shepherd told PolitiFact Florida that case law has changed on this even within the past year. "In Hillsborough, they would have to give up one of those homesteads," he said. Our ruling Nelson tried to whack accusations about his lower tax bill for a family pasture with a claim that Mack takes tax breaks of his own in the form of "two homestead exemptions." Mack and his wife both serve in Congress, representing two different states on opposite coasts, and that’s clearly an unusual situation. They each own their own homes in their respective states. While it’s true Mack and his wife have two homestead exemptions between them, it is not accurate for Nelson to say Mack himself has two homestead exemptions. That would not be lawful, and Mack’s county property appraiser has vetted his case and determined it proper. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-05118	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey gave the government the power to electronically spy on Americans without a warrant.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/27/michael-opitz/big-brother-spying-us-candidate-says-yes-and-blame/	A Republican primary candidate for Congress calls himself a friend of the tea party. The incumbent? A friend of Big Brother. Michael Opitz, a Cobb County Air Force veteran and activist, is one of two Republicans challenging U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey for his seat in Congress. One of his YouTube videos says the Republican congressman from Marietta is voting away your privacy rights. The nearly two-minute video is a slide show of surveillance imagery, including an illustration of the Statute of Liberty using binoculars and a still photo of the creepy antagonist from "The Matrix." The accusation is set to the Hall and Oates’ tune "Private Eyes." It appears in text: Gingrey "Gave Government the Power to Electronically Spy on YOU, YOUR FAMILY, the Average US Citizen. All YOUR Private Information Collected. Analyzed. Graphed. Categorized. STORED. Without a Warrant," it said. Are private eyes watching you? Do they see your every move? PolitiFact Georgia asked Opitz for more information on how Gingrey has given the government the power to "electronically spy on you, your family, the average U.S. citizen." The video touched on other issues, but since privacy was the ad’s main issue, we’ll focus our inquiry on this subject. Opitz pointed PolitiFact Georgia to the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, otherwise known as CISPA. CISPA, or H.R. 3523, gives private companies such as Internet service providers, telecommunication companies, commerce sites and social media networks permission to share certain information with the federal government without a warrant. In light of other changes in privacy laws and the development of new technologies that can catalog and track personal information, Opitz considers CISPA a big step down the road to tyranny. "This is George Orwell’s ‘1984’ on steroids," Opitz said. CISPA allows corporations to give intelligence agencies information on cyber and national security threats. The information can also be used to stop child exploitation and protect people from bodily harm. Gingrey co-sponsored CISPA, which passed the House on April 26. It has yet to clear the U.S. Senate. President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill. Gingrey campaign manager Jonathan Klein said the bill contains privacy protections. "Because of the dramatic rise in cyber attacks, this bill is designed to protect critical U.S. infrastructure, not ‘spy’ on unsuspecting families," Klein told PolitiFact Georgia in an email. We found Opitz’s claim had shortcomings. It’s premature to say that Gingrey "gave" the government more opportunities to look at consumers’ private information. CISPA is stalled in the Senate. In addition, the bill’s language specifies that it does not give the federal government the power to collect "all" of your private information, as Opitz said. But Opitz raises a valid point. Whether those restrictions will do enough to protect John Q. Public’s Google searches from being collected and cataloged is a hotly debated matter. CISPA lists types of information the federal government may not use, including firearm sales, book sales, tax returns and medical records. It also says that the feds may not save or use information for purposes other than what the bill describes. Paul Rosenzweig of the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation thinks Opitz’s claim is wrong. Allowing more information sharing is not the same as giving more power to the federal government, he said. Rosenzweig also pointed to language in the bill that says that information will be subject to "anonymization." Personal information would be stripped from the information that corporations hand over. "If you believe the government will completely go crazy, that’s a ‘Minority Report’ scenario that will never happen," Rosenzweig said. Still, opponents and supporters of CISPA agree that there is legitimate dispute over whether the privacy protections are tough enough. CISPA is written to protect corporations who opt to share information with the feds from lawsuits by consumers. This feature may make companies less scrupulous about withholding personal information such as your membership in an anti-abortion group or that you marched at an Occupy Wall Street rally. Opitz’s video makes a valid point, said Rainey Reitman, who directs advocacy against the bill for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "He does it dramatically, but it is a correct criticism," Reitman said. Under CISPA, corporations, not the consumer, decide what the government gets to see, said Michelle Richardson, an attorney who has been fighting the bill for the American Civil Liberties Union. "It does completely shift the presumption of privacy of the American citizen," Richardson said. Where does this leave Opitz? Opitz said that Gingrey "Gave Government the Power to Electronically Spy on YOU, YOUR FAMILY, the Average US Citizen." Opitz’s rhetoric is overheated, and a few of his facts need tweaking. CISPA hasn’t passed the Senate, so if the bill is designed to give the government additional powers, then it hasn’t done it yet. In addition, the bill contains language that supporters say will prevent government spying. But he does raise a legitimate criticism of CISPA. The bill’s protections may not be enough to keep average Americans safe from Hall and Oates’ private eyes. Opitz’s statement raises real issues. But he overstates some key points, and it could use a lot more context. Our rating: Mostly False.	None	Michael Opitz	None	None	None	2012-06-27T06:00:00	2012-05-29	['United_States']
pomt-04659	The Obama administration is allowing state waivers from welfare work requirements "only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/10/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-obama-administration-trying-boos/	Former President Bill Clinton used his elder statesman’s status in the Democratic Party to make the case for Barack Obama’s re-election, while touching on a subject paramount in his own legacy: welfare reform. In 1996 Clinton signed a landmark bill that transformed welfare from an indefinite entitlement to temporary assistance for poor Americans that required them to eventually join the workforce. Mitt Romney, in a campaign ad, has claimed that Obama gutted the work requirement. Clinton countered that in his Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. Here’s what Clinton said really happened: "When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama administration listened because we all know it’s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today. So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge. "And the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less." At PolitiFact, we have examined this welfare controversy before. Here, we’ll review the issue in light of Clinton’s new statement. The HHS memo Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states. The grant program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually find a job. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce. A July 12, 2012, memo from George Sheldon, acting assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states "of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The memo outlined the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that "improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems" and "demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities," to give two examples. What does that mean? "If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures," is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.) The waivers, then, would inject some flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes. Sebelius’ letter HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reasserted the intent of the changes in a July 18 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. "The proposal we have outlined strengthens the law’s purpose to move people off of welfare and into jobs by utilizing state-based innovation. Our goal is to accelerate job placement by moving more Americans from welfare to work, and no policy which undercuts that goal or waters down work requirements will be considered or approved by the Department," Sebelius wrote. She noted how, in 2005, several governors sought such flexibility in welfare and state waiver authority. That letter was signed by 29 Republican governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. Now, some states are again asking for flexibility, Sebelius wrote, naming Utah and Nevada, which both currently have Republican governors. She said some of the policies they requested would not meet the new HHS requirements. "The department is providing a very limited waiver opportunity for states that develop a plan to measurably increase the number of beneficiaries who find and hold down a job. Specifically, governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work compared to the state’s past performance," Sebelius wrote. "States must also demonstrate clear progress toward that goal no later than one year after their programs take effect. If they fail, their waiver will be rescinded." Because no waivers have yet been approved, it’s difficult to say exactly what the changes would look like. The policy debate It’s important to note that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for activities that don’t count currently. Schott offered the hypothetical scenario that a state might change some requirements for specific subgroups, such as two-parent families, possibly by letting them stay in school longer. A waiver would let the state count those parents toward its work participation requirement. That is credit a state doesn’t get now and that could be counted toward a 20 percent improvement. That broader definition has some critics concerned. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow "state bureaucrats" to count activities that aren't really work. "In the past, state bureaucrats have attempted to define activities such as hula dancing, attending Weight Watchers, and bed rest as ‘work.’ These dodges were blocked by the federal work standards. Now that the Obama administration has abolished those standards, we can expect ‘work’ in the TANF program to mean anything but work," Rector argued. He also wrote, following Clinton’s speech, that the 20 percent increase Sebelius is demanding is a "meaningless measure" because in a typical state 1.5 percent of welfare recipients leave the program for work every month. To increase that by 20 percent would be a bump to only 1.8 percent of recipients gaining employment. "What will the other 98.2 percent of the caseload be doing? No one knows for sure. But one thing we do know for certain: They will be exempt from the federal ‘work participation’ requirements established in the welfare reform law," Rector wrote. Schott counters that the 20 percent improvement measure doesn’t exempt anyone from working. "Nothing about the waiver lifts the work requirement on any individual. The waiver is about the state’s performance measurement," she said. "The federal work participation requirement is something that states must meet. … Nobody is suggesting waiving that." Rector also contends that Sebelius is not legally authorized to issue waivers of existing work requirements. He argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions. "Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived," Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review. His argument on that point got an important affirmation this week when the Government Accountability Office said that Sebelius’ waiver proposal is "subject to the requirement that it be submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect." The Obama administration did not ask for Congress’ approval to grant waivers. Our ruling Clinton said in his convention speech that the Obama administration "agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment." That's an accurate recap of the planned changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. By granting waivers to states, the Obama administration is seeking to strengthen welfare-to-work efforts by letting states try different approaches based on their residents’ needs. That’s important too -- the waivers would be considered for individually evaluated pilot programs. HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law. The waiver offering was spurred by requests from several governors, including Republican governors, and Sebelius explicitly stated that only requests that "demonstrate clear progress" toward enhancing employment will be approved by HHS. Clinton’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2012-09-10T15:04:53	2012-09-05	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-06332	"Governor Christie also remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/10/john-wisniewski/democratic-party-chairman-blasts-chris-christie-on/	The Democrats claim Gov. Chris Christie's coattails aren’t strong enough to sweep Republicans into power. That’s a departure from more than 50 years of history in New Jersey, a period where the party of every governor has seized control of at least one arm of the Legislature, according to the chairman of the state Democratic Party. Before voters went to the polls for Tuesday’s election, Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) released a memo on Monday, calling Christie "ineffective" for his inability to drum up enough support to send more Republicans to Trenton. "Governor Christie also remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term," Wisniewski said. "The last Governor who failed to have his party control at least one legislative body during his term was Governor Charles Edison, a Democrat, who served from 1941 to 1944." The election is over and the reins of the Legislature remain firmly in Democratic hands, as they have been since the Republican governor was first elected in November 2009. But is Christie the only governor whose party hasn’t taken control of at least one legislative house in more than five decades? PolitiFact New Jersey found Wisniewski’s statement is misleading. The Democrat is comparing a governor only midway through his first term with governors who served up to eight years in office. Wisniewski argued that his statement is accurate, because it’s based on the facts as they exist today. "I don’t understand why that would be an issue. That’s factually accurate," Wisniewski told us. "The facts speak for themselves." It’s true that since Edison left office in 1944, the party of the governor-elect or the incumbent governor has either gained control of at least one legislative body or maintained control of both houses. However, the party of two governors -- including Republican Gov. Tom Kean -- didn’t win control of any legislative body until the governor’s second term. Kean took office in 1982, when Democrats controlled both legislative houses. The GOP would not gain control of a legislative body until Kean won re-election in 1985, and Republicans secured the majority in the Assembly. Democratic Gov. Robert Meyner began his tenure in 1954 at a time when Republicans controlled the Legislature. The GOP would maintain control throughout his first term and, when he won re-election in 1957, the Democrats took control of the Assembly. The cases of Kean and Meyner prove the same point: From when they were first elected to near the end of their second year in office -- the same point where Christie now stands -- Kean’s and Meyner’s parties had not won control of a legislative body. "The jury is still out on Chris Christie," said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute. "It’s unfair to make that comparison yet since he’s not out of office." Republicans could still assume control of a legislative house during Christie’s tenure, but the new legislative map approved in April makes that scenario nearly impossible, Murray said. "The map favors everybody who’s already in office," Murray said. Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University, also said Wisniewski’s comparison is inaccurate. The best measure is comparing governors’ first mid-term elections, she said. "You can’t assess Governor Christie’s tenure when his term hasn’t yet been completed," Harrison said. There’s another problem with Wisniewski’s statement -- it ignores cases where a sitting governor’s party lost control of a legislative body. One of the most glaring examples of that dynamic occurred under former Democratic Gov. Jim Florio. When Florio was elected in 1989, the Democrats assumed majorities in both legislative houses. Two years later, the Democrats lost 31 seats as Republicans took control of the Legislature. Our ruling Wisniewski said in a memo that Christie "remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term." But that comparison is not valid. Christie has been in office for less than two years and we found two other governors since World War II whose parties had not won control of a legislative body at the same point in their terms. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07321	If the Sellwood Bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/may/14/charlotte-lehan/will-sellwood-bridge-have-be-shut-down-eight-years/	The Sellwood Bridge, opened in 1925, is the only crossing in a long stretch between the Interstate 205 and Ross Island bridges. It’s skinny and worn out and people have been talking forever about doing something about it. In the mid-1980s, the maximum vehicle load on the bridge was reduced to 32 tons. In June 2004, the county dropped the limit even further, to 10 tons, after discovering cracks. TriMet buses and heavier trucks have not been allowed since then. Last year, Clackamas County commissioners approved a $5 annual increase in motor vehicle registration fees to help pay for a new bridge. The issue is now before voters, some of whom argue it makes no sense to pitch in for a bridge owned by neighboring Multnomah County even if it is used by Clackamas County residents. Bridge supporters argue that if left alone, the Sellwood will have to be shut down soon. "Our time to act is limited -- if the bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years," wrote Clackamas County Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan. "This will lead to increased congestion and wait times on alternate routes including I-205, Highway 43 and McLoughlin Boulevard… Its complete closure would further hurt the hundreds of Clackamas County businesses and families who depend on it." Eight years. Yikes. That’s a pretty specific timeline and a pretty definitive statement. Obviously, we wanted to know where she got her figure. Tim Heider, spokesman for Clackamas County, said Lehan based her statement on a study provided by Multnomah County staff. The engineering study was conducted by David Evans and Associates in 2005 and had two purposes: to assess the condition of the Sellwood, and to find out what Multnomah County would need to do to keep the bridge in operation for another 10 to 15 years, at various weight limits, until a major rehabilitation or replacement could occur. The engineering group detailed how much money was needed to maintain different load limits. Multnomah County chose the least expensive option -- $1 million to inject epoxy into cracks and to monitor the situation. The load limit remained 10 tons. Simple math tells you that six years later, we have at most nine years remaining on the original 10- to15-year time frame. Mike Baker with David Evans said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon that he found Lehan’s statement "consistent with conclusions reached by our firm." We at PolitiFact Oregon are not ones to quibble with engineers. They know a lot more about bridge mechanics than we do. But we still had questions. Did the county have any other evidence pointing to a bridge shutdown within eight years if it’s not replaced? Is replacement, and not repair, the only option for getting more life out of the bridge? And, significantly, what happens if Clackamas County voters vote down the vehicle registration fee on the May 17 ballot? After all, Lehan said what she said in the context of urging a yes vote on a fee increase. Multnomah County officials haven’t been very clear on what would happen if voters reject Measure 3-372. Clackamas is providing only $22 million of an estimated $290 million for a new bridge, but with funding already short $20 million, Multnomah County spokesman Mike Pullen said the county is not optimistic it could make up yet another $22 million. "We are working to replace the bridge, as you mention," Pullen wrote in an email. "But we cannot replace it if we can't pay for it. Without the $22 million from Clackamas County the project could be delayed, take longer to complete, or be partially completed." We also asked Pullen if the county had any other evidence indicating a bridge shutdown date. He spoke with the county's project manager and lead bridge engineer for the Sellwood Bridge, and reported this: "He said there is not a hard and fast date when we know we will need to close the bridge if it does not get repaired. But in the absence of that, the David Evans study is the best guide to how long the bridge can remain in service in its current condition," Pullen said. And finally, is replacement the only way to get more life out of the bridge? Pullen argued yes, because the county concluded it’s not cost-effective to do anything less. The spokesman could not entertain the possibility that more repairs or a lower weight limit might extend the life of the bridge, because in 2005 the engineering company’s "task was to tell us what it would take to keep the bridge in service ... for 10 to 15 years." We hate to say it, but all of this left us vaguely dissatisfied. Let’s return to Lehan’s statement: "Our time to act is limited -- if the bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years." She didn’t say, well, based on this study the bridge has about four to nine years left at the 10-ton limit, if nobody does anything about it in the meantime. She didn’t say that the study was in response to a specific question asked by Multnomah County. The bottom line is that PolitiFact Oregon can’t predict the future -- and neither can Charlotte Lehan. Her statement contains some element of truth -- there is a study, there is a time frame -- but it ignores the fact that officials would have to abandon long held plans and do nothing else in the interim for the Sellwood Bridge to "have to be shut down." We rate this statement Barely True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this statement and rating. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

pomt-08831	"The state budget has gone up over 80 percent under Rick Perry."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/12/bill-white/bill-white-says-state-budget-80-percent-under-rick/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White stopped in Midland on Monday, saying he'll be fiscally wiser as governor than the Republican incumbent. "I know how to squeeze value out of taxpayers' dollars," White told Midland's KWES-TV, Channel 9. "The state budget has gone up over 80 percent under Rick Perry. That's just too much. We're not getting the value out of those dollars that we need to get out." Over 80 percent? That percentage sounded familiar. In a February Truth-O-Meter article, we reported that budgeted non-dedicated state spending increased 80 percent from the 2000-01 budget, adopted the year before Perry became governor, to the current budget. We found shaky Perry's statement that on his watch, "we cut state spending." After asking White's campaign for backup on his "over 80 percent" statement, we revisited the budget numbers -- and realized an error of our own. We were correct in February that budgeted non-dedicated spending has increased about $25 billion during Perry's decade-plus as governor. Indeed, such spending increased from $55.7 billion in 2000-01 to nearly $80.6 billion in 2010-11, according to the "Fiscal Size-up" for 2010-11 published by the Legislative Budget Board. However, we miscalculated the percentage increase, which was 45 percent -- not the 80 percent we reported. And how did White reach his proclaimed increase of over 80 percent? The entire budget, counting all funding sources including federal and local aid, increased from nearly $101.8 billion in 2000-01 to almost $182.2 billion in 2010-11-- a boost of 79 percent. (Please free free to check our math; we thank you.) We ran the 79 percent bump by Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. He suggested any comparison of the 2000-01 budget and the 2010-11 budget take into account two factors in the latest budget that weren't at play in 2000-01. First, Perry and state lawmakers agreed several years ago to cover reductions in school property taxes with state revenue; that's costing $14 billion in the 2010-11 budget. Craymer said that commitment doesn't translate to an increase in government spending; it's a shift in which level of government is doing the spending. Second, the latest budget includes about $12 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid. Take the combined $26 billion out of the comparison and the state budget increase since 2000-01 falls to 53 percent. The budget board offers another way of weighing changes in spending by adjusting raw budget numbers for changes in population and inflation. At our request, the board created a chart enabling us to compare the adjusted numbers for the 2000-01 budget against the 2010-11 version. Counting all funding sources, during Perry's gubernatorial years the state budget adjusted for changes in population and inflation has increased 18 percent. So, where does this leave White's statement? White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in a Tuesday e-mail that White should have said "about 80 percent" in the Midland interview instead of "over 80 percent." Bacon's e-mail also notes expectations the 2011 Legislature will confront an $18 billion revenue shortfall, which Bacon calls a deficit. Given that, her e-mail says, "Bill will have to make cuts. He is very good at this and has often discussed his approach to making cuts and finding efficiencies. He has said he needs to 'get under the hood' and also work with legislators on specific cuts." Upshot: Budgeted spending increased nearly 79 percent on Perry's watch, not the "over 80 percent" White said. Also, there are ways to analyze the increase that reduce the growth percentage. Still, it's defensible to lean on raw budget amounts. We rate White's statement Mostly True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-08-12T06:00:00	2010-08-09	['None']

pomt-07163	"We already have $23 billion worth of debt."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/13/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-state-debt-23-billion/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a record $615 million from the 2011-12 state budget on May 26, 2011, targeting an array of money for projects such as university buildings, a rainwater study and $4.8 million for public broadcasting. The latter cut caused station managers across the state to worry about possible layoffs, station closings and an increased reliance on private donations. In a June 2 interview, ABC 27 reporter Jerry Hume in Tallahassee asked Scott if vetoing public broadcasting dollars was a hard choice compared to other line items. Here is Scott's full response (available by video): "I don't think the state ought to be paying for that. But the easy ones are things like studying how to collect rainwater, stuff like that, and a new barn and things like that. But there's a lot of tough ones. But the way I thought about it was, what should state government be doing? I mean, there's a lot of good things in there, but they were local issues, or charity should be doing it, or there's a better way of doing it, or we're already doing it a different way. "And on top of that, I don't want to increase the debt in the state. We already have $23 billion worth of debt, so those are things I thought about. But really, it was how do we get jobs going?" Scott mentions the state debt as support for his big cuts, even though the state wasn't going to issue new debt just for public broadcasting. But it got us thinking: How big is the state debt, anyway? Turns out, this isn't the first time Scott has bemoaned the state's debt. In late May, Scott warned he was thinking about vetoing Public Education Capital Outlay projects, which pay for college and university construction projects and represent the state's largest bond program. He said the added debt of $134 million could jeopardize the state's credit rating and increase costs of future borrowing. "I'm clearly focused on the amount of debt the state has," Scott said then. "I'm clearly focused on the debt rating." Where does he get that number? Our search for the state debt level starts with Scott spokesman Lane Wright. He directed us to a December 2010 report on Florida's debt affordability, written by the State Board of Administration's Division of Bond Finance. The division is responsible for executing bonds authorized by the Legislature and administers financing programs for educational facilities and transportation projects, among other programs. As of June 30, 2010, the state's total overall debt outstanding stood at $28.2 billion. Now, this doesn't mean Scott's figure is off from the get-go. That $28.2 billion figure includes $23.6 billion for "net tax-supported debt" and $4.6 billion for "self-supporting debt." These are important differences to understand (page 7 of the document is helpful). Net tax-supported debt, which Scott seems to reference in his TV interview, is debt accrued when the state issues bonds to raise money for spending on projects such as PECO, Everglades restoration, right-of-way acquisition for roads and bridge construction. Self-supporting debt is made up of bonds that include a source of revenue, and is excluded when calculating the state's benchmark debt ratio. Examples of this are bonds to build toll roads, covered by the tolls, or university dorm maintenance, covered by student fees. Net tax-supported debt is paid off through the state's ability to tax all residents and tourists, while self-supporting debt is paid off by the people who pay to use the facilities. The benchmark debt ratio is important SBA jargon for measuring the state's annual payment on borrowed money, said Ben Watkins, the division's director. The annual payment, called debt service, works kind of like a mortgage, in which you pay off a chunk each year over a certain span of years. Debt service is based on tax-supported debt. To calculate the benchmark debt ratio, the division divides the annual debt service -- for tax-supported debt only -- by available state revenues. Florida Statutes say the ratio should not exceed a target of 6 percent and a cap of 7 percent. But in 2010, it was over the cap at 7.91 percent. That did not happen as a result of outstanding debt, Watkins said, but declining state revenues (the denominator of the benchmark ratio equation). The Legislature authorized more borrowing in 2010 due to a "critical state emergency," pursuant to state law. The law on benchmark debt ratios is really a "soft" policy limit to give lawmakers perspective on how much debt the state can afford, Watkins said. The cap is seen as a planning tool and not an absolute ceiling, though other states have "hard limits." Still, exceeding the "soft cap" should signal the state has borrowed all it should, and more borrowing should happen for absolutely essential projects, Watkins said. Anyway, Florida pays about $2.1 billion a year for debt service on the state's tax-supported debt. There's another type of debt to consider, called indirect debt. Unlike tax-supported and self-supported debt, this category does not get as much attention because the debt obligation lies with a separate legal entity such as Citizens Property Insurance, Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation, water management districts or the Florida Housing Finance Corporation -- not the state. As of June 30, 2010, the indirect debt total was $16.4 billion. It is a whopping figure, but it is not included in the state's debt ratios or debt burden, according to the report. We mention all of this to explain that Scott is essentially short-handing the state's debt by describing it as $23 billion. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. "This is the debt (figure) that matters to the state from a financial management perspective," Watkins said. Putting Florida debt in context Now that we've considered the 2010 financial report, we looked for another opinion to make sure we understood all the context. Florida TaxWatch, a group that analyzes state spending and taxes, uses the same data supplied by the Division of Bond Finance to track the debt. Kurt Wenner, TaxWatch vice president of tax research, echoed much of Watkins' analysis and agreed that $23 billion is probably the most accurate figure to use to describe the state debt. "That is the amount of debt that is backed by Florida taxpayers," Wenner said. Florida's debt doesn't get as many people talking as the country's $14 trillion-plus national debt. One explanation is that Florida has a balanced budget requirement, Wenner said. So it cannot "spend money it simply doesn't have, like Washington does." Florida's borrowed money goes toward "bricks and sticks" projects, Watkins said, and not for normal government operations. Florida's total outstanding debt last year grew $1.8 billion, exceeding the $1 billion average for the past decade, according to the report. Still, the debt is considered "moderate" and "manageable" at its current level. Our ruling Scott said he thought about the state's $23 billion debt as he weighed whether to veto certain programs. We verified that figure with the Division of Bond Finance's most recent estimate, and experts consider the figure a street convention to describe the debt. We rate his claim True.

pomt-13693	"We fixed a loophole in the (gun) background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-correctly-says-while-governor-state-clos/	Tim Kaine says he steered Virginia through some dark days as governor, but none was worse than April 16, 2007. That was the day a gunman murdered 32 students and faculty members at Virginia Tech before he took his own life. In the aftermath, Kaine says he turned his attention to Virginia’s gun laws. "We fixed a loophole in the background record-check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer," Kaine told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday while accepting his party’s nomination for vice president. Josh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, backed Kaine’s statement by pointing to several articles about an executive order Kaine issued shortly after the shootings. The order expanded the court records that are shared with law enforcement officials to ensure that mentally ill people who are deemed dangerous can’t buy firearms from licensed gun dealers. Federal law bars people who have been adjudicated "mentally defective" from purchasing firearms. But the Virginia Tech gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, cleared background checks in early 2007 to buy the two semiautomatic pistols he used in the massacre despite having been found by a judge to be a danger to himself in December 2005. Cho was ordered to undergo outpatient care, but that record wasn’t shared with Virginia law enforcement officials, according to a state report on the shootings that was issued in 2009. As a result, Cho’s history wasn’t entered in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and he was cleared to buy the firearms. Virginia’s laws were unclear about whether Cho’s mental health records were required to be sent to the state police so that they could be entered into national background check files. The issue centered around the fact that Cho had been ordered to undergo outpatient mental health treatment instead of being sent to an inpatient facility. While state law was clear that anyone admitted to an inpatient care facility couldn’t buy a gun, the law was ambiguous on whether someone ordered to undergo outpatient care was barred from buying a weapon, according to the 2009 state report examining the shootings. Kaine issued his executive order on April 30, 2007, two weeks after the Tech shootings. He mandated that state agencies collect information about people who are required to undergo mental health treatment "whether on an inpatient or outpatient basis" and send those records to state and federal databases to ensure they can’t buy a gun. Even with Kaine’s order, gaps remained. The Washington Post noted in an article that Kaine’s executive order wasn’t retroactive, meaning it only covered court orders made after its April 2007 enactment. Also, it didn’t address a loophole in state law that allows people to buy guns from unlicensed sellers without undergoing a background check. An unlicensed seller is someone who is not in the business of dealing firearms, such as a citizen seeking to sell a gun he keeps in his house. In 2008, the General Assembly passed a bill that enshrined Kaine’s executive order on mental health records into law. But Kaine failed in an effort to go one step further and close the loophole that allows private sales of guns without a background check. Our ruling Kaine said that while governor, "We fixed a loophole in the background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer." Kaine can legitimately take credit for plugging a gap in state law that allowed some mentally ill people to buy guns even after having been ordered by courts to get outpatient treatment. So we rate his claim True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-07-29T14:29:36	2016-07-27	['None']

pomt-10490	"I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/hillary-clinton/very-well-in-mass-and-calif/	Citing a mock election that Sen. Barack Obama won, a reporter for a student newspaper asked Sen. Hillary Clinton why her numbers aren't as strong with young voters. "Well, I think they're getting better," Clinton said at the March 25, 2008, news conference in Greensburg, Pa. "You know, I was very pleased at the reception that I've gotten here in Pennsylvania. And, you know, I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California." Clinton uses three big states whose primaries she won to prove her popularity with young people. Exit polls from those states show she competed well with Obama for voters under 30 years old in two of the three states: • In California, she and Obama tied at 49 percent each. • In Massachusetts, she won 49 percent. Obama won 48 percent. • In Ohio, Clinton won 35 percent. Obama won 61 percent. Clinton did better among the youngest voters — those under 25 — in California and Massachusetts, but fared worse in Ohio: • In California, Clinton won 50 percent to Obama's 48 percent. • In Massachusetts, she won 57 percent while Obama took 39 percent. • In Ohio, Clinton won 29 percent compared to Obama's 70 percent. Joe Lenski of Edison Media Research, the company that conducts the exit polls, said the sample sizes for the voters under 25 in the three states were only about 100 people each — too few to produce meaningful results. "I wouldn't say (she did well) with that number because the sample size is too low," said Lenski, who is the executive vice president. "But I'm a survey researcher, not a politician." The figures for voters under 30 are more reliable, he said, and agreed with Clinton's claim that she did well with young voters in Massachusetts and California, where she split the vote with Obama. Considering Clinton usually trails Obama by about 20 points among young voters, a tie is pretty good, Lenski said. Exit poll patterns show her performing best among older voters, he added. Lenski noted that Clinton won even more youth votes in Oklahoma and Arkansas — 60 percent and 56 percent under 30, respectively, he said — but may have passed over those examples because they're not big, core Democratic states like California and Massachusetts. It has been a bit of conventional wisdom in this campaign that Obama is winning the youth vote, which is why we evaluated Clinton's claim of doing "very well" in that context. As Lenski said, splitting the under-30 vote with Obama in Massachusetts and California is a good record for Clinton, and we find that part of her claim to be true. But by including Ohio in her claim, where Clinton took less than half of the under-30 vote that Obama won, she has gone way too far, leading us to conclude that her overall claim to doing "very well" among young voters is Half True.

pomt-09180	Charlie Crist "bizarrely vetoed" $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida "despite having previously argued the budget request had merit."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/04/marco-rubio/rubio-says-crist-vetoed-his-own-item/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio wants voters to see his independent opponent Gov. Charlie Crist as a repeat flip-flopper who vetoed a project out of political spite. In one of Rubio's most recent claims, posted to his campaign website June 2, 2010, he says that Crist "bizarrely vetoed" $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida "despite having previously argued the budget request had merit." Here is what Rubio wrote: "For his latest astounding flip-flop, Charlie Crist on Friday vetoed nearly $9.7 million in state funding for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida despite having included the funding as part of his budget recommendation in January. As part of his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2010-2011, Charlie Crist’s office even wrote a justification for the budget request that can be read HERE. Yet, Crist bizarrely vetoed the funding despite having previously argued that the budget request had merit. Was this political payback for Republican leaders no longer supporting him? Is there anything else that could explain a seemingly inexplicable flip-flop?" There is no dispute that Crist vetoed $9,673,569 for Shands teaching hospital -- line item 185. The veto on May 28 was one of about $371 million in budget vetoes. So the only question is if he had "previously argued the budget request had merit." Some background: Shands at UF is a teaching hospital in Gainesville that serves many uninsured patients and draws patients from throughout the state. In the last fiscal year, Shands UF provided about $49 million in unreimbursed financial assistance. But Crist's veto could cost the hospital at least $12 million in matching federal funds, according to a June 2 article in the Gainesville Sun. Now, some political context leading up to Crist's veto. Crist included $9,673,569 for Shands in his recommended budget that was released in January. When he proposed his budget, Crist -- a Republican at the time -- was in a battle for the Republican Senate primary with former House Speaker Rubio. During the spring legislative session, his relationship with some Republicans soured over disagreements about abortion, teacher tenure and other issues. He found himself lagging behind Rubio in the polls and announced April 29 that he would ditch the GOP and run as an independent. So that means Crist was an independent by veto day. Rubio provides links to Crist's budget request for the hospital funding. It includes the appropriation bill showing the money for Shands hospital. Shands officials were surprised by the veto. "We had no idea this was coming," Shands spokeswoman Kim Rose said in a June 3 interview. "We had not been asked any questions about it. This appropriation was included in his last three budgets and he had recommended it for this one." A May 29 press release from Shands stated: "This line item in the governor’s budget has been in place for three decades and historically has been funded through a recurring general revenue allocation. As one of the state’s largest charity care providers, these state funds were the only source available for Shands at UF to be eligible for additional federal funds since it is not part of a local taxing district." A May 30 article in the Gainesville Sun, one day after Crist's veto, quoted from a memo written by Shands HealthCare CEO Tim Goldfarb. "Goldfarb said in the memo that the veto was unexpected because Crist had recommended the funding as part of the budget and approved it in his previous three proposed budget plans,'' stated the article. "Goldfarb added the total impact could be even greater because the state cut could lead to a reduction in federal money." The Florida Times-Union had a direct link to Goldfarb's memo. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey told Health News Florida and the Gainesville Sun that the governor vetoed the money because it was targeted at a single hospital and no other hospitals received the same type of additional funding. Crist wrote in his May 28 veto message that his budget would protect the most vulnerable -- though he vetoed money for Shands, a hospital that serves many poor patients. "While economic recovery is on the horizon, General Revenue dollars are still scarce and spending has to be carefully prioritized to provide the most critical services to the citizens of our state," Crist wrote. The governor defended his veto, according to a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times June 4 article: “The concern was more with the process of it, to be honest with you. And the lateness of it. I didn’t want things that came late and didn’t have the complete committee vetting opportunity.” Crist denied that his veto was political: “It’s motivated by being an appropriate process (and) the economic reality that we’re living in.” Michelle Todd, a spokesperson for Crist's campaign, replied to PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail: "The majority of the budget provides funding for essential state services, protects our most vulnerable, keeps our citizens safe and provides for education of our children. As stipulated in the Governor's budget signing letter on May 28, 2010, he directed staff '...to provide a thorough review of each item in the budget. Through this process we have identified projects in the budget that were inserted late in the process; funded outside of established processes; and earmarked funds benefiting a select group or geographic region.' The Shands Teaching Hospital line item falls into this last category and is the only Teaching Hospital in the state receiving a distinct general revenue recurring line item in the General Appropriations Act. While it is true that this item was contained in previous Governor's Recommended Budgets, the current economy and outlook for the near future dictated a thorough review of all projects." It's clear that Crist vetoed $9.7 million for Shands, though it had previously been in his budget. His campaign argues that Florida's weak economy led to the veto decision. We rate Rubio's claim as True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-06-04T14:27:18	2010-06-02	['Charlie_Crist', 'University_of_Florida']

pomt-12303	Says investigators have found remains of missing women in steel barrels buried on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s property.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/26/freedomcrossroadsus/saga-bodies-found-barrels-clinton-property-fake-ne/	A series of posts that say more than a dozen sets of human remains have been found on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, N.Y., property are fake news. "Breaking: Barrels removed from Clinton property contained parts from 3 missing women," read the headline on a June 20, 2017, post on FreedomCrossroads.us. Facebook users flagged that post and others related to it as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. The June 20 article said that investigators had unearthed a 55-gallon steel drum from the Clintons’ yard. The barrel contained the remains of three women who went missing in Arkansas in 1974, the story said. There was no date or context on the post, but it did note that "the barrel, which contained the arms, legs and heads of the three women, was filled with what the medical examiner calls a ‘crude preservative.’ " The story is fake, as are subsequent stories about the same investigation that followed the June 20 post. There is no corroborating evidence any of this happened. The photo used with the story is from 2012, when a man and a woman were found in a barrel in a South Carolina lake. FreedomCrossroads.us posted more stories about the fake Clinton storyline over subsequent days. One story added to the site on June 21 said 11 more drums were found on the grounds, while "the Clintons sat rocking in their chairs on the front porch sipping coffee or tea while the home they’ve lived in more than 15 years was exposed as a graveyard." By June 23, the website was declaring Bill Clinton even went to high school with two of the victims, but neither Clinton would be facing any charges over the 14 sets of remains, for lack of evidence (and bribing the FBI). These stories have spread online, showing up on other websites, but they still aren’t real. FreedomCrossroads.us said on its page footer that the site fabricates its content. "Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate," it reads. The site featured a similar page design to TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet. That site was run by a man named Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll living in Maine. He told us in the past that his aim was to trick conservatives with fake news stories that exposed how gullible they were. A Whois lookup showed that FreedomCrossroads.us is registered to Blair, and lists information PolitiFact had previously used to contact him (although the email address has changed since we first checked the site). The site was registered on Aug. 18, 2016. We have tried to reach Blair to verify he was the site’s owner but didn’t get any response. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-11461	"We are last in the nation in startups — 50th."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/08/dana-wachs/wachs-hits-mark-startups/	State Rep. Dana Wachs took aim at Wisconsin’s business climate while pitching his candidacy for governor in a radio appearance. Amid criticism of the funding package for Foxconn Technology Group, the Eau Claire Democrat dropped a brief reference to new businesses activity in the state: "We are last in the nation in startups — 50th," Wachs said in the Jan. 29, 2018, appearance on "The Devil’s Advocates" show in Madison. "You can’t get any worse." Are 49 other states really ranked higher on startups than Wisconsin? Let’s ask the experts. Study supports startup claim Startup research is a niche field that experts say is only addressed in detail by one group — the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Olivia Hwang, a spokeswoman for Wachs’ campaign, said that is the research the candidate was referring to in the radio appearance. The foundation, one of the country’s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations, has put out an annual report for years ranking each state’s "startup activity." It’s a customized metric that combines number of startup firms per capita, percentage of the adult population that become business owners in a given month and percentage of new entrepreneurs starting businesses because they saw market opportunity (i.e. that weren’t previously unemployed). Their latest study, released in May 2017, ranked Wisconsin dead last for the third straight year. Nevada, Oklahoma, Wyoming, California and Texas topped the list, while New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Alabama joined Wisconsin at the bottom. We should note other measures of Wisconsin’s business climate place Wisconsin closer to the middle of the pack, as we noted in a 2017 fact check on Gov. Scott Walker’s claim that Wisconsin was a "Top 10" state for business. Wisconsin is 15th among all states in business survivability, with 51% of businesses remaining in operation at least five years. And Kauffman rated Wisconsin second in the nation for Main Street Entrepreneurship, another combined metric that looks at the survival rate and the per capita number of businesses and business owners. Wachs, a member of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. board, is one of 16 Democrats vying for a spot on the November general election ballot opposite Walker. Major opponents include state schools Superintendent Tony Evers; Milwaukee businessman Andy Gronik; state firefighter union President Mahlon Mitchell; Sen. Kathleen Vinehout of Alma; former state Democratic Party Chairman Matthew Flynn; Madison Mayor Paul Soglin; former state Rep. Kelda Roys; and political activist Mike McCabe. Our ruling Wachs said Wisconsin is last in the nation in startups. The go-to national research on the subject shows Wisconsin is indeed last — and has been for the last three years.

pomt-03442	Says TriMet spends "$10.3 million in police contracts" a year for 56 transit police who must respond to non-transit calls	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/22/amalgamated-transit-union/does-trimet-spend-10-million-year-transit-police-r/	The Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 757, took to newspaper outlets this month, berating TriMet for causing its own financial troubles. The union represents bus drivers, mechanics and support staff for the Portland-area’s public transit system. The two sides are in contract negotiations. The union’s large-size ad, which appeared in The Oregonian and other publications, takes aim at TriMet for what union leaders describe as squandered spending. For example, the ad says TriMet spends $10.3 million a year for transit police who are rarely around. "We love our transit police officers. They are competent and caring. But we seldom see them. This is because they must respond to non-transit calls. When we ask what these 56 officers do for $10 million per year, TriMet’s response is that it doesn’t audit performance under the contracts," reads the ad, titled "TriMet Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?" We haven’t the faintest idea who handles security on MAX and buses, or how duties are allocated. So we were game to check it out. Does TriMet pay $10 million a year for 56 transit officers who respond to non-transit calls and aren’t around much? TriMet’s public affairs department says the assertions are inaccurate. It issued a point-by-point rebukethat you can read on its website. The transit agency says that the Transit Police Division has 62 sworn law enforcement officers on contract, led by a Portland Police commander. In 2011-12, TriMet budgeted $8.64 million -- of which $8.15 million was spent on salaries, benefits, insurance and vehicles. While waiting for Bruce Hansen, union president, to return our calls and emails, we decided to take a look-see into the TriMet budget adopted for 2013-14. Because we’re not really sure why TriMet cites 2011-12 numbers in response to a claim made in June 2013. We scrolled through the budget and found on page SS-5, $10.2 million for police security contracts. A follow-up conversation with TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch illuminated that the security contract costs are even higher -- there’s just over $500,000 for the canine unit -- for a total of $10.7 million. So, the transit union appears to be pretty spot on with the dollar amount. TriMet says the number of officers is 62, not 56, as stated in the ads. Hansen said that they relied on information received from TriMet through public records requests. He’s not sure why TriMet is using 2011-12 figures either. TriMet says that’s what the union requested. We’ll leave that alone. Now, what about the union’s assertion that transit police have to respond to non-transit calls? TriMet has policing contracts with 17 law enforcement agencies in the region. Each agency contributes a set number of officers who make up the Transit Police Division. The number may change based on officer availability, but Portland Police provides the largest number of officers. Transit police is a contracted service, but it’s not unlike other police divisions. Officers apply for a post. They serve multi-year terms. Members are expected to patrol vehicles and stations and enforce TriMet ordinances, such as not smoking at shelters and at MAX platforms. The union suggests that the public is not getting enough value for the amount of money spent on transit police. We have no idea if that’s a fair accusation, although TriMet says transit police spend at least 70 percent of their contracted time on transit related matters. TriMet has been much in the news. The Oregonian has reported on sleepy drivers behind the wheel, sneakily distributed pay raises for executives and managers and historic fare increases and service cutbacks. In other words, we’re sure TriMet has way more problems to worry about than a mere $10 million transit police contract, out of a $485 million operating budget for Fiscal Year 2014, which starts July 1. Let’s go to the ruling. The agency has budgeted $10.2 million for police contracts. The budgeted amount is $10.7 million if you include the canine program. We think those numbers are pretty close to the $10.3 million cited by the union. The number of officers is 62 according to TriMet, which again, we don’t see as being that significantly different from 56. Are transit police seldom seen? That’s not something we can rule on. We suppose that is in the eye of the beholder. Must transit police respond to non-transit related calls? Yes, that’s because they are sworn officers who must respond to whatever calls roll in, just like any law enforcement officer on the job. The statement is accurate but needs clarification as to number of officers and why they’re not dedicated solely to TriMet. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07913	Says the United States does not "trade as much as other developed nations."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/01/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-trade-lags-behind-other-de/	When a former United States trade ambassador wins a seat in the U.S. Senate, it’s a sure bet he’ll advance his pro-trade views when talking with constituents. So Rob Portman, the freshman Republican senator from Ohio, surprised no one when he told the Toledo Regional Chamber of Commerce on Jan. 20 that the United States "should be aggressively promoting the reduction of barriers overseas to U.S. products." But Portman, a trade ambassador under President George W. Bush, added this nugget, according to coverage in the Toledo Blade: "We don’t trade as much as other developed countries." That latter statement struck us as curious since the United States appears to export a massive amount of goods and services -- $1.8 trillion worth in 2008, according to Commerce Department data. Measured in absolute terms, few countries can match the United States when it comes to products shipped abroad, according to the World Trade Organization and the CIA World Factbook, both of which put United States exports of merchandise, the broadest category, behind only Germany and China. But Portman’s communications director, Jeffrey Sadosky, told us that when Portman was comparing United States trade with that of other countries, he was measuring the value of exports as they relate to each country’s overall economy. Sadosky pointed us to the World Bank, which tracks the value of exports from all countries and rates them as a measure of gross domestic product, or each country’s output of goods and services. By that measure, the United States is a slacker. World Bank data that we reviewed independently showed the United States to be near rock bottom: This country’s exports represented 13 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, equal to Haiti and barely better than Nepal and Tonga (12 percent) and Ethiopia (11 percent). We chose 2008, as did Portman, because it represented a year before economies were declining rapidly. To make this easier to understand, consider this analogy about crime. A big city is likely to have more crimes than a small one, so in absolute numbers, the big city will seem a lot more crime-ridden. But if you compare the number of crimes against the number of people living in a small city, you get the crime rate, which can more accurately reflect the safety of a community. Comparing trade numbers can yield the same kind of distortion. Looking just at absolute numbers, a large country like the United States can appear to be in the top tier of exporting nations. But if you compare exports to the GDP, you get a much different picture. Here’s how some other nations compare with the U.S. export-to-GDP ratio of 13 percent: Japan, 18 percent Australia, 20 percent. France, 27 percent Russian Federation, 31 percent Canada, 35 percent China, 35 percent Germany, 47 percent Economists say there are logical reasons for this disparity. The United States is rich with resources and largely self-sufficient. It borders only two other countries, whereas cross-border trade in Europe grew out of necessity as well as custom. Germany and China have developed economies that specifically promote and rely on exports. And as the World Trade Organization notes other factors, including the price of fuel and exchange rates, can affect the ratios. Portman argues the United States could expand its economy and develop a lot more jobs if it followed a more aggressive export path. We’re not here to debate trade policy, but we checked with experts in academia and at the World Bank to see if Portman’s way of measuring trade -- as a percentage of GDP -- was valid. Yes, they said. "That way of measuring trade is considered to be appropriate, although, as you recognize, those small relative numbers mask very large absolute numbers," Donald Boudreaux," a professor and authority on the economics of international trade at George Mason University, told us in an e-mail. Yet Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, a manufacturers’ group that focuses on domestic growth, took issue with the way Portman uses this export ratio. Portman left out a big part of the equation, Tonelson suggested.. That’s because if the United States accepts more trade agreements in order to expand exports, it is likely to result in more foreign goods coming into the United States, too. That’s the very problem with existing trade agreements, Tonelson and other critics say: The benefits of jobs supporting exports are outweighed by the jobs lost as companies move operations offshore to use their cheaper labor. "Unfortunately, far too many of these free trade agreements have been structured not to expand net U.S. exports but to boost net U.S. imports," Tonelson said in a telephone interview. "In fact, they have been aimed largely at outsourcing, and we know this because so many of them in the 1990s were signed with very low-income, very export-dependent countries like Mexico and China." We’re not going to settle that debate. Plenty of people, including Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also support going slow or applying the brakes on trade. But we’ll note that Portman has a lot fellow travelers, including President Barack Obama, who wants to double U.S. exports in the next five years. Even the administration of Ohio’s former governor, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, described exports as a bright spot in the state’s economy. So we turn to the Truth-O-Meter. Portman’s statement was made to bolster of a point of view. But economists say that Portman’s measure -- exports as a percentage of GDP -- is valid and useful.

pomt-01424	"The Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington. It was put together by governors and by states."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/08/kay-hagan/kay-hagan-says-federal-government-didnt-create-com/	The Common Core education standards have not been popular with many Republicans, who say the guidelines will hamstring state school officials. At the debate for the U.S. Senate candidates from North Carolina on Oct. 7, Republican Thom Tillis described Common Core as regulatory overreach. Although he did not explicitly call it a federal mandate, his comments strongly implied that was the case: "What I oppose," he said, "is a bureaucracy, the Department of Education, that was not even created until 1980, after I graduated from high school, with 5,000 bureaucrats making on average $102,000 a year, stifling what teachers want to do in the classroom. The problem with Common Core is that teachers were being more worried about how they meet up to the standards than what they really want to do pursuing their passion educating the kids. Common Core, No Child Left Behind, Race To the Top all had strings attached to them." That prompted incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat, to say that Common Core was not a federal mandate. "The Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington," she said. "It was put together by governors and by states, setting high expectations for students all across this country so that we could not only compete against one another within our states but we would be more competitive on a global basis." Is Hagan correct that "Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington. It was put together by governors and by states"? Common Core's origins Conservatives around the country have attacked the Common Core State Standards, a set of benchmarks for English and math that were unveiled in 2010. The criticism has stirred debate about the federal government's role and whether the focus on them is strictly political. PolitiFact Wisconsin has examined the question in different ways. A claim by Wisconsin State Sen. Joe Leibham that Common Core is a federal mandate earned a False rating in July. An opposite claim in October 2013 -- that Common Core "is not from the federal government," that they "do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all" -- was rated Mostly True. The reality is that Common Core came out of years of discussion between private, nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal was to better prepare students for college and careers and to ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, that council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core. They developed the standards with the help of teachers, parents and experts. Although Common Core is voluntary, the federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards. States earned a small number of extra points (40 of a possible 500) in the competition for grants from Race to the Top, Obama’s signature program that provided added money for education, if they adopted standards to prepare students for college and work. They didn't have to adopt Common Core, but they were better positioned to secure the federal money if they did. Our ruling In the North Carolina debate, Hagan said, "Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington," she said. "It was put together by governors and by states." She is right about how the program was assembled, although it’s worth noting that the federal government has given states financial incentives to adopt the standards. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-12449	U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies "charge five times more for people over 50."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/may/11/save-my-care/gop-health-care-bill-charges-five-times-more-peopl/	A group fighting against the Affordable Care Act repeal says that House Republicans voted for a health care bill that would lead to skyrocketing costs for older consumers. Save My Care, a health care advocacy group, launched an ad attacking two dozen GOP House members who voted for the American Health Care Act including U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Miami. "Congressman Curbelo just voted for a disastrous health care repeal bill opposed by the American Medical Association, AARP and the American Cancer Society. Curbelo voted to raise your costs and cut coverage for millions, to let insurance companies deny affordable coverage for cancer treatment and maternity care, and charge five times more for people over 50. Curbelo voted yes even though the bill makes coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions," the ad claims. The same ad also attacks U.S. Rep. Brian Mast who represents Florida’s Treasure Coast and members in many other states, including moderates who could face tough re-election campaigns in 2018. The ad is largely digital but in some districts it will appear on TV. Formed in 2016, Save My Care is affiliated with Eric Kessler, a former White House appointee, helping to manage conservation issues during Bill Clinton’s administration. It operates out of the same office as the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) that launches projects related to global health and other areas. There were a lot of claims to check out from the ad, but we wanted to know whether the bill allows insurance companies to "charge five times more for people over 50." One provision jumped out right away: Insurance companies could charge five times more for those ages 50-64 buying insurance on the individual market. Some viewers might assume the five-fold increase starts from zero. What the ad doesn’t tell you is that insurers can already charge older people more than younger adults — three times as much. Age ain’t nothing but a number (but it could make insurance more expensive) For this fact-check, we’re looking at what the proposed House health bill does about older adults between ages 50-64 on the individual health insurance market. So this doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people between 50 and 64 years old who have employer-sponsored coverage. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. This is known as 3-to-1 "rate banding." The House bill increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio. Before the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adults’ health care, said Linda Blumberg, health policy expert at the Urban Institute. So the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults. The goal was to make coverage more affordable for older adults regardless of their health status. If the House bill with the 5-to-1 rate banding were to become law, older adults would pay more than current law, according to an estimate by the Rand Corporation, which evaluated an earlier version of the American Health Care Act, or AHCA. (The research was funded by the Commonwealth Fund, which aims to increase health care access for the poor.) The increased costs would occur, Rand Corporation said, as a result of tax credits in the House bill not increasing with age as steeply as premiums. Young people, however, would get a break on premiums. Older Americans could get hit with other costs, too The change in age ratios is just one of many provisions of the House proposal that could change the costs for older adults. The legislation would replace the current income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. For adults over 60, that would mean a $4,000 credit. For adults under 30, the credit would be $2,000. The legislation phases out tax credits for individuals who make more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who files jointly earning $150,000). Kaiser created an interactive map to show that the cost impact varies based on several factors. "Generally, people who are older, lower-income or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA," Kaiser concluded about the House bill. A Congressional Budget Office analysis of an earlier version of the legislation (the final legislation did not receive a CBO score) concluded that it would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit. For an example: Under current law, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 would pay a net premium of $1,700 after factoring in a tax credit. Under the House bill, according to CBO, that person’s premium rises to $14,600. (See table 4) Older Americans could see more changes if states choose to redefine essential health benefits for coverage in the individual market. "I cannot imagine a scenario where the AHCA is not worse for older adults than the ACA," Blumberg said. Curbelo’s spokeswoman told us Curbelo has called for improving the bill that he voted for. "The congressman is continuing to work to ensure that all Americans have access to coverage options they can afford, focusing specifically on making sure we increase the amount of the tax credits for lower income Americans and for those nearing the age of retirement," Joanna Rodriguez told PolitiFact. Our ruling The Save My Care ad says that Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies "charge five times more for people over 50." The ad refers to a provision that will allow insurance companies to charge adults five times more for insurance than younger people buying on the individual market. But the ad could leave a misleading impression that it’s five times more than the current situation -- and that’s not the case. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to charge this age group three times as much for insurance (which was considered a better deal than the situation before). Also, the increase in the ratio applies to Americans ages 50-64 -- not seniors who are on Medicare. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01076	"Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jan/16/floridians-solar-choice/florida-one-five-states-ban-certain-solar-sales-pe/	When it comes to solar, the Sunshine State is, well, in the dark, say advocates. A coalition of folks across the political spectrum ranging from tea party activists to environmentalists have united to launch a campaign to allow the direct sale of solar energy to consumers. Currently, state law only allows utilities to sell power, but a new political action committee, Floridians for Solar Choice, wants to change that. The PAC seeks to get a referendum on the ballot for the 2016 election. They will need 683,149 signatures by Feb. 1, 2016 -- an effort that could cost millions of dollars. The PAC argues that Florida is out of touch with the majority of states on solar. "Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business," according to the group’s website. We decided to shed a little light on how Florida stacks up on solar energy. While solar has been expanding nationally, Florida isn’t a solar leader: it ranks third in solar capacity but 13th in installations, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar represents less than 1 percent of Florida's energy generation, and the state projects only a tiny fraction of percentage growth over the next decade. In November, the Public Service Commission approved allowing utilities to end solar rebates in 2015 and gut energy efficiency goals by 90 percent, because the utilities claimed neither is "cost-effective." The source of the data on the 5-state ban Florida law only allows a few utilities such as Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric to sell power directly to consumers. If a solar power generator wants to get into the state market, it must first sell to one of those utilities. Floridians for Solar Choice want to make it cheaper for residents to buy solar power directly from a provider. The evidence that only five states forbid that kind of direct sale comes from a map from the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE), a project based at North Carolina State University funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy. The map shows the states that allow third-party solar power agreements. Under power purchase agreements (PPAs), an installer/developer builds a solar system on a customer’s property for free and then the developer sells the power to the customer. The map, dated November 2014, shows that at least 24 states allow these third-party solar agreements - though in some states there are certain restrictions, such as only allowing them of a certain size or on a type of property. The five states that don’t allow any such agreements are Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The map shows the status as unclear or unknown in 21 states. The states that are unclear or are unknown are "because the statutory law is silent about the issue and from what we can gather, no solar companies in these states have attempted to sell electricity directly to a customer," said Brian Lips, DSIRE Project Manager. That means those 21 states are in a legal gray area, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association. "It isn’t specifically allowed or disallowed, but given the laws in place, it’s not hard to imagine that a court would uphold the utility’s exclusivity," Johnson said. "Most states don’t go so far to protect monopoly utilities, but Florida is one of them." Another way to compare states on solar We sent the group’s claim to spokespersons for Florida’s Public Service Commission and utilities including Duke Energy to ask if they had any information to refute or support the claim. A spokesman for Duke Energy directed us to Solar Power Rocks, a research and advocacy organization which ranks the states on solar policies. On this ranking, Florida landed in the middle of the pack with a "C" and 24th among the states. But this website doesn’t take into account the third-party PPAs -- it considers other factors such as whether states offer tax exemptions or rebates for solar. A spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission, Cindy Muir, questioned characterizing Florida as one of only five states with such a ban, since 21 states are classified as unknown. Muir also said that Florida law does allow leases for solar. Under that scenario, a developer installs the solar energy system and the customer pays for it over years rather than paying for the power produced. The advantage of the PPA is that the customer doesn’t hold the production risk. Under a lease, the customer can end up paying the same whether the system ends up producing 100 percent of expected electricity or a lesser amount, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Our ruling "Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business," says Floridians for Solar Choice website. That statistic comes from a respected academic source that published its findings in 2014. However, the statement doesn’t mean that 45 states allow sales. Currently, 24 states specifically allow an entity to build a solar system on a customer’s property and then sell the power to the customer. In 21 states, the status is unclear or unknown, and pro-solar advocates say few if any sales are happening there. Still, the claim is accurate that only five states specifically prohibit these types of sales. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00797	"Did you know that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language?"	true	/virginia/statements/2015/apr/06/randy-forbes/forbes-says-us-among-few-nations-without-offical-l/	What’s the official language of the United States? If you said English, you haven’t read U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes’ blog lately. "Did you know that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language?" Forbes, R-4th, wrote. We put the congressman’s claim to the test. Forbes’ office referred us to the CIA, which publishes "The World Factbook," a website of data on 240 nations, territories and regions. Among other things, it lists the languages spoken in each of the places and whether its government has sanctioned an official tongue. The CIA says that while 82 percent of people in the U.S. usually speak in English, our nation "has no official language." Forbes wants to change that. He’s among 31 cosponsors of a bill that would declare English the official language of the U.S. and require the federal government to transact just about all of its activities in English. Similar legislation has died in Congress in recent years. The practical effects of the legislation may be slim. We asked a representative of U.S. English, a group lobbying for an official language, how the bill would change the way government now operates. Matthew Shuman, the group’s manager of government relations, was hard pressed to come up with concrete examples. He said the bill would generally ease pressure on agencies to voluntarily help non-English speakers and that, in return, would improve efficiency. Many supporters find high symbolic value in the legislation. Efforts in recent decades to establish official English are tied to concerns about growing levels of immigration into the U.S., according to a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service. Forbes, a critic of President Barack Obama’s immigration policies, blogged, "As a nation of immigrants created by a common thread of language, it is important that we protect the unity that the English language affords us." Opponents say the official English movement stigmatizes of people who are legally present in the U.S. but do not speak English in their homes. While the U.S. doesn’t have a sanctioned language, 31 states -- including Virginia -- have laws establishing English their official tongue. Virginia’s law, passed in 1996, says "no state agency or local government shall be required to provide...any documents, information, literature or any other written materials in any language other than English." There’s one piece of work left here. Forbes’ statement also says the U.S. is among few nations with no official language. So we need to spin the globe. There are 196 nations, according to infoplease.com, an online almanac. The CIA lists no official language for 14 of them. Aside from the U.S., they are American Samoa, Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Holy See, Iceland, Jamaica, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mexico, San Marino and the United Kingdom. Our ruling "Did you know that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language?" Forbes wrote. You certainly do now. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04729	Clackamas County Commissioners "approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the county’s contribution to TriMet’s Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/30/clackamas-county-commission/did-clackamas-county-negotiate-199-million-trimet-/	A majority of the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners recently approved a new agreement that reduces the county’s share of paying for TriMet’s new Orange line project, better known as Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail. This prompted many pats on the back from the county. Here’s the first sentence from the county media release sent out to press: "Clackamas County Commissioners on Wednesday approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the county’s contribution to TriMet’s Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million and approved the sale of bonds to pay the obligation." The three commissioners who voted in favor put out statements congratulating their financial savvy. The re-election campaign of commission Chair Charlotte Lehan issued a press release that stated that "the new terms are expected to save Clackamas County taxpayers at least $6.6 million in general fund obligations." Commissioner Jamie Damon, also up for re-election in November, issued a campaign release that stated that the settlement would "save over $5 million -- a reduction of over 20 percent from the original $25 million project." Commissioner Ann Lininger, who is retiring, submitted a guest column to The Oregonian in which she said the county approved a $19.9 million financing plan and settlement terms to fulfill its obligations to TriMet. She also said the agreement enables the county "to avoid a late-payment penalty of as much as $1.25 million." Cool, right? Taxpayers love saving money. And commissioners probably think this is a good way to placate residents who are on the fence about a MAX line between Portland and Milwaukie. The agreement comes before a Sept. 18 election on a county ballot measure, which, if approved, would require voter approval before officials can spend money on light rail. Instead of singling out a commissioner, we will focus on the statement put out by the county since it sums up nicely the numbers on which the three-member majority wants to focus: $19.9 million versus $25 million. The new agreement with TriMet does slice $2.4 million from the $25 million. But that leaves a balance of $22.6 million, not $19.9 million. The county also agrees to other actions that are in-lieu of cash payment: Donate a parcel of land with a real market value of $20,915. Pay for road and signal improvements worth $1,279,740. Waive the county’s engineering fees, valued at $1,365,307. The total value of the listed in-kind contributions comes to $2,665,962 -- resources that could be used for other county services if they weren’t going toward light rail. Subtracting those contributions leaves a cash balance of $19,934,038 the county owes TriMet. In other words, $19.9 million. (The county isset to sell $19.1 million in bonds Sept. 6, toward the balance due.) The Oregonian’s Clackamas County reporter has consistently characterized the cost of the new agreement with TriMet as $22.6 million, even if the new amount that requires financing is lower. We think that’s more accurate, despite politicians’ inclinations to inflate. So does Dan Chandler, strategic policy administrator and the county’s point man on the subject. "The reduction in borrowing is $5 million, but the actual savings are less than that," Chandler said. The original agreement signed in February 2010 called for Clackamas County to pay TriMet $25 million toward the cost of the $1.5 billion project. Section 4.1 of the contract states the county could meet that amount by lump-sum payment or payments or in-kind contributions, or any combination. Let’s return to the statement: Did the commission approve a new deal that lowers the county’s contribution to $19.9 million, down from $25 million? It did not. The county’s financial contribution to TriMet for the new Orange line is now $22.6 million, much of which will be financed by borrowing. The in-kind contributions come from money the county will now forgo or must spend to meet its obligations. Those are real dollars. We find the statement to be False.

pomt-00931	Says Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce’s "own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/25/wisconsin-contractor-coalition/contractors-say-business-support-right-work-law-mi/	More than 400 Wisconsin firms in construction contracting oppose the Republican push for a "right-to-work" law, which would block companies and workers from signing agreements requiring employees to pay union dues. Here’s how they explain their stance: They’re fine with the current set up, under which they employ 120,000 trades workers -- most in unions -- and collaborate with the unions on training, wages and workplace safety. This, the Wisconsin Contractor Coalition claims, helps attract new business and jobs, while right to work "compromises each of these, infringes on the rights of private businesses and is a detriment to Wisconsin’s overall economy and tax base." Meanwhile, state manufacturing firms and some other big businesses are rallying on the other side, contending Wisconsin workers deserve the freedom to work and receive the benefit of unions without paying dues. The Contractor Coalition’s website makes this claim about Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby: "WMC’s own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation." That would be a jaw-droppingly low number. Let’s check the evidence. Surveying WMC members Twice in the last seven months, WMC has publicized some results from surveys of executives whose firms belong to the group. We’ve reported on the limitations of these surveys before: They don’t represent a random sample of the group’s membership or of businesses statewide. A small minority of CEOs typically respond to the questions. And the group does not publicly post the wording of questions. During the summer 2014, the survey sent to 1,200 executives asked for the top thing state government could do to improve the business climate. In all, 261 execs filled out the survey. From a list of eight concerns, the top change sought was "reduce taxes" (35 percent), a WMC news release reported. Second was "become a right to work state" (15 percent), WMC spokesman Jim Pugh told us. Trailing that, in no particular order, were education reform/school choice, affordable health care, reduce regulations, tort reform, reduce spending and economic development. Pugh said 15 percent making it their top priority was a "huge number." But Stephen Lyons, a spokesman for the Contractor Coalition, argues the result showed the lack of urgency among WMC members on right to work. The trouble here for the Contractor Coalition is that the survey did not gauge support for right to work, as it claimed. Rather, it showed the intensity level executives felt about right to work when compared to other priorities. The coalition’s website, where the claim was made, went live in December 2014. At that time, the survey was the most recent by WMC on the topic. Since then, WMC released partial results from a survey that ended in January 2015. That survey directly asked: "Would you support state legislation to allow individual private sector workers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to join a labor union (Right to Work) or do you support current Wisconsin law that mandates union membership (Closed Shop)?" The question is flawed because it misstates current law, three veteran employment and labor attorneys -- Mark Sweet, Michael Aldana and Peter Davis -- told us in separate interviews. Since at least 1947, "closed shops" -- which require that only union members be hired -- have been illegal. Under current law, unions and the company can agree on contracts that require newly hired employees to pay the equivalent of union dues. In these so-called "union shops" workers do not have to join the union but pay a share of the unions costs for collective bargaining and other services. A right to work law would bar employers from entering into these type of agreements. Twenty-four states have such laws on the books. One footnote: As a practical matter, in the construction industry, many collective bargaining agreements require employers to hire through union halls, though non-union workers can also get on hiring hall lists. In addition, the WMC question’s phrasing is tilted toward right to work with the positive "freedom" description while inaccurately describing current law as a mandate. With those major caveats in mind, here’s what the 2015 WMC survey found: 81 percent (250 of 308 respondents) favored a right to work law. The Contractor Coalition calls that number misleading, saying WMC has 3,600 members, so only 7 percent came forward to say the favored right to work. Maybe so. But the survey went out to 1,200 executives, not the full membership. And the coalition’s own claim clearly referred to the favorability rating among "respondents" to the survey. Our rating The Wisconsin Contractor Coalition claimed: "WMC’s own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation." This is a misstatement of the WMC survey results, the first of which showed 15 percent of respondents wanted right to work as their number one priority, but were not asked whether they favored it. The second survey, though flawed as noted, found 81 percent of responding executives favored right to work. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04242	Says New Jersey is "50th in return of our federal tax dollars."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/18/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-new-jersey-receives-smallest-r/	New Jersey doesn’t just need a lot of federal aid to rebuild a coastline ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, the state also deserves it, according to Gov. Chris Christie. NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams asked Christie recently if it’s fair for people who have no interests in the Jersey Shore to ask, "Why the money? Why the effort, if this is the new normal?" "Well, listen, it's fair to ask it but I have the answer," Christie said during the Oct. 30 interview. "The answer is that for New Jersey, which gives so much to this country -- by the way, 50th in return of our federal tax dollars. So New Jerseyans send more than any other state in America in federal taxes, getting back less. When that's done and you see that our state is a state that needs this to contribute to our economy and also to the soul and the vibrancy of our state, I think we have very good answers and arguments to make. And you count on one thing: you're looking at the guy who is going to make those arguments." With Christie building part of his case for federal assistance around the state’s return on federal tax dollars, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether his premise is true. Add "Donor State" to the list of New Jersey’s monikers. Depending on the year -- and whether adjustments are made to federal data -- New Jersey ranks at or near the bottom nationwide in this category. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, tracked how much the federal government collected through taxes and returned through expenditures to states every year from 1981 to 2005. The Washington, D.C.-based foundation calculated the federal tax burden -- a measurement meant to account for taxes that are assessed in one state, but impact taxpayers elsewhere -- to conduct its analysis. In 17 of those 25 years, New Jersey came in last place, receiving 70 cents or less for every dollar it sent to the federal government. In 2005 -- the most recent year analyzed by the Tax Foundation -- the federal government gave New Jersey 61 cents for every dollar it took. That was the smallest return of any state. But that was seven years ago. Though the Tax Foundation hasn’t updated its findings, other studies show New Jersey still ranks near the bottom. The Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes 18 states in the region, released a May 2011 report on federal spending and taxation patterns that focused on New Jersey. New Jersey ranked 48th in the nation. Only Minnesota and Delaware received smaller returns on their federal tax dollars in 2009, according to the report, which relied on raw, unadjusted data. PolitiFact New Jersey’s analysis of federal data from 2010 also put New Jersey in 48th place. So even the raw data put New Jersey near the bottom in this category. But Colleen Cain, a senior policy analyst with the Northeast-Midwest Institute who prepared the 2011 report, said in an e-mail, that "the news behind this is not all bad." In the report, Cain attributes the low ranking to New Jersey’s "relatively high income levels and greater-than-average business income tax contribution, coupled with a relatively low need for federal aid. It does, however, underscore the importance of states like New Jersey in supporting the fiscal health of the nation generally." Our ruling Christie said that New Jersey is "50th in return of our federal tax dollars." The Tax Foundation’s analysis of 2005 data, which was adjusted to reflect each state’s overall federal tax burden, ranked New Jersey 50th in the nation in this category. The state received 61 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington, D.C. that year. Though that research is outdated, more recent analysis of raw data shows New Jersey still ranks near the bottom.

pomt-14255	Says there were over 600 reports of Texas votes for Donald Trump in the state’s 2016 Republican primary virtually all getting tallied for Marco Rubio.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/apr/11/committee-restore-americas-greatness/pants-fire-claim-there-were-over-600-reports-trump/	According to a super PAC supporting New Yorker Donald Trump for president, Texas Republicans just experienced a wagon’s worth of election fraud, all oddly to the good for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (who later dropped out of the race). We read the post on stopthesteal.org on April 6, 2016 while looking into a claim by Republican consultant Frank Luntz who had said in a tweet that Team Trump "has accused Ted Cruz," the Texas senator battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, of fraud in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin. That’s Half True, we found. Luntz, by way of offering factual backup for his claim, guided us to a post on stopthesteal.org, the website for the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness, a super PAC created in December 2015 by Trump supporter and former campaign operative Roger Stone to back Trump and attack rivals, especially Rubio, according to a Reuters news story at the time. The web post aired concerns about fraud in seven states including Texas after stating the Trump Ballot Security Project was formed "when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the" March 2016 "Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case," the post says, "votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio." Cruz handily won the state’s March 1, 2016, primary with 43 percent of the GOP vote. Trump finished second (27 percent) and Rubio third (18 percent); Ohio Gov. John Kasich landed fourth with 4 percent, according to the Texas secretary of state. We asked Stone about the basis of stopthesteal.org’s proclaimed Texas irregularities. By email, he initially noted the ballot security project had shifted to its own website though the provided address didn't lead to any web page just a few days later. Stone further said affidavits collected from voters in multiple states hadn’t been made public and, he said, such issues would be in the jurisdiction of a credentials committee at the July 2016 Republican National Convention. "The form of evidence of voter irregularities the" party’s "credentials committee finds compelling is up to the committee and no requirement that a complaint with the state election board or report to party officials is required to make a claim," Stone wrote, adding that the affidavits would be submitted to the committee if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel "elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected" through "a pattern of voter fraud." Stone said the pro-Trump super PAC has "collected over 2,200 individual SWORN affidavits documenting voter irregularities in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona. 738 of these are in Texas in at least eight counties. We are NOT finished collecting affidavits in Utah and Wisconsin," Stone said. "Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign," Stone said. Before reaching Stone, we hunted for news reports about stopthesteal.org’s described irregularities and also looked for its declared 600-plus reports of Texas votes for Trump actually going to Rubio. Those searches came up empty save for an Austin radio host’s mention of unsubstantiated complaints. A video dated March 1, 2016 shows an interview of Todd Jeffries, co-host of KLBJ-AM’s morning "Todd and Don Show," by a reporter for the conspiracy-minded InfoWars.com. In the interview, Jeffries said the show had surprisingly fielded about a dozen phone calls from Austin-area voters saying their Trump votes incorrectly showed up as Rubio votes; he didn’t indicate if the concerned voters uniformly fixed such errors before finalizing their ballots. Next, to our inquiries, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas and the chairman of the Travis County Republican Party each said he hadn’t heard or seen any reports of Trump votes being recorded for Rubio--or Cruz. Mike Joyce, the state party spokesman, said by phone said he hadn’t seen even one such news story. "I would have heard about it," if so, Joyce said. "It would have been brought to our attention." Joyce said that when he heard about the calls to KLBJ-AM suggesting ballot problems, he checked with James Dickey, chairman of the Travis County GOP, who reported back that he’d heard no such reports from polling places. Dickey said by phone he heard "limited reports" about Trump votes showing up for Rubio, but nothing was confirmed. To our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state, the state’s chief elections officer, said she couldn’t comment on formal complaints pending review and investigation. That said, Alicia Phillips Pierce said, the agency didn’t receive 600 written complaints in connection with the 2016 primaries. Pierce said the agency fielded less than a dozen "calls from individuals concerned that votes may have been changed from Trump to Rubio," but no one "indicated they had experienced the supposed phenomena themselves or had any direct knowledge of what allegedly occurred. Instead, they were only responding to second-hand reports they heard on the radio or saw online," she said. Stone dismissed the lack of confirmation from Texas news reports, writing: "Old media. Proves nothing." He also put no stock in the responses we’d drawn from Pierce and on behalf of the state and Travis County Republicans. "Why would they admit it?" Stone wrote. Our ruling A pro-Trump super PAC said there were over 600 reports of Texas votes for Trump virtually all getting tallied for Rubio. If so, those reports are no longer public, which leaves us to speculate about the content of the unreleased affidavits described by Trump backer Stone.

pomt-04420	Says "as Co-Chair of the Joint Ways & Means Committee, I secured the key piece of funding for" the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/15/mary-nolan/did-mary-nolan-really-secure-funding-new-bridge-pr/	It’s been nearly 40 years since Portlanders have seen a new bridge constructed over the Willamette River. That will change soon with the addition of the Milwaukie light rail bridge, scheduled to be up and running by fall 2015. Once the deck starts going up and the cables are attached, it’ll be one of the most visible public works projects for the city in some time. It’s little wonder, then, that Portland City Council candidate Mary Nolan is touting on her website her role in making it happen. "We’re building the first new bridge across the Willamette in more than 40 years, this one dedicated to transit, pedestrian and bike traffic," she writes on her website. "As Co-Chair of the Joint Ways & Means Committee, I secured the key piece of funding for this important project." We see a lot of claims like these -- where folks who sat on a committee claim some crucial role. Sometimes it’s real, sometimes it’s a stretch. We wondered what the situation was here. We called TriMet to figure out what the deal was with the Legislature’s funding contribution for the project. Spokeswoman Mary Fetsch pointed us to House Bill 5036 from 2007, which authorized $250 million worth of lottery bonds for the project. The funding at the state level was itself instrumental in securing matching federal dollars. Back in 2007, Nolan was, indeed, a co-chair of the budget writing committee, along with now-Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s fair to say that, as co-chairs of the committee, they had final say on how the dollars were spent. We wondered, though, just how big a role Nolan played in this particular get for the city of Portland. We spoke with TriMet lobbyist Olivia Clark. She described the process as a group effort. She ticked off several names -- Rep. Carolyn Tomei, Rep. Dave Hunt, now-U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, now-Secretary of State Kate Brown and Schrader -- as essential in getting the funding secured. As for Nolan, she called the candidate’s involvement "vital." "She was definitely a leader in the effort," Clark said. On Clark’s advice, we also spoke with Schrader, who confirmed Nolan’s role in the effort as essential saying that "Mary was big on this piece." When we spoke with Nolan, she talked about how she had held firm on getting the full amount in 2007 -- even after the governor’s office had pushed to hold off until 2009 or to split the sum between two bienniums. "I said ‘No’ and Schrader backed me up," Nolan said. "It was critical for the metropolitan region." Clark, the lobbyist, recalled a similar negotiation when we spoke with her earlier. Nolan said she "secured the key piece of funding" for the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge. It might be nice if that read "helped secure" instead -- it was certainly a group effort. But based on committee assignments and interviews with two people closest to the negotiations, it does appear that Nolan played a key role. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04057	People committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the Baker Act will get their guns back "automatically and immediately upon discharge....and their commitment is never entered into a background check database."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/25/mike-ryan/do-police-automatically-return-guns-someone-after-/	Following the shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Sunrise Mayor Mike Ryan has become one of the leading advocates in Broward County for changing laws to improve school safety. Ryan, a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, called for several measures, including the need to address mental health and guns, in the political blog BrowardBeat.com. "Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database," said Ryan, in a guest column on Jan. 14. "As a result, there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun." Ryan’s claim suggests that it’s a cinch for someone "committed" for up to three days under the Baker Act to reclaim their guns, and that they stay off any list that would ban them from getting a new one. We wanted to check to see if Ryan was correct. What is the Baker Act? Under the Baker Act, law enforcement can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others. A person can’t be held involuntarily for longer than 72 hours, but a medical expert needs to examine the person and sign off on his or her release. We should point out that the simple act of being held under the Baker Act doesn’t mean the person is mentally ill or in need of commitment. In 2010, less than 1 percent of about 140,000 involuntary examinations led to involuntary placement in a mental health treatment facility, according to the Florida Department of Children and Families. This number doesn’t account for people who voluntarily remained in facilities. The Baker Act doesn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. So law enforcement can take their guns when they are transported to a facility under the Baker Act. We couldn’t find data regarding how often someone who is Baker Acted has their firearm taken. "Most individuals don’t have weapons at the time of the Baker Act," said Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman, who chairs judicial committees on mental health. But interviews with attorneys, law enforcement officers and experts on the Baker Act revealed, it does happen. We consistently heard from law enforcement that whether they take the gun for safekeeping depends on the specific case. For example, if a wife calls police to report that her husband is despondent and has a gun, and he is Baker Acted at home, police would take the gun, said Hillsborough Sheriff Col. Jim Previtera. But if someone is Baker Acted on the street and didn’t have a gun on him, the sheriff’s office wouldn’t go to his home and seize the gun. Under the Baker Act, people who haven’t committed crimes are not supposed to be treated as criminals and they do retain their constitutional rights -- including the right to own a gun. So do they get their guns back? A 2009 Florida Attorney General opinion specifically states that law-abiding people who are released under the Baker Act should get their guns back. "In the absence of an arrest and criminal charge against the person sent for evaluation under Florida's Baker Act, (law enforcement) may not retain firearms confiscated from such persons and retained by that office," concluded then Attorney General Bill McCollum. The opinion didn’t outline procedures for gun retrieval. That means "there is absolutely no consistency around the state in how this is being practiced," according to former state Baker Act director Martha Lenderman, who now trains law enforcement. How do police deal with firearms and Baker Act? We contacted a few law enforcement agencies and other experts about how the gun retrieval is handled. "You are supposed to get your gun back automatically, but rarely does that happen because they are in the hands of the police department," said Jon Gutmacher, an Orlando defense attorney and former Broward prosecutor who specializes in firearm cases. In Ryan’s city of Sunrise, the police department doesn’t have a written policy on returning guns after a Baker Act. There have been multiple cases where the department required a court order, Deputy Chief Gerald Eddy told PolitiFact Florida. But there have been times when gun owners tell Sunrise police that the law doesn’t require a court order and threaten litigation. In such cases, the department has to decide whether to still require the court order. (Ryan told us that he has directed city officials to write a policy to require a court order in all cases "while we advocate for the law to be changed to relieve us of the obligation to return guns to those Baker Acted.") We found many law enforcement agencies -- including the sheriff’s offices in Broward and Hillsborough and police departments in the cities of Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and nearby town of Davie -- do require a court order. Miami-Dade requires a court order if the person used the gun to breach the peace but not if the medically cleared person didn’t use it to breach the peace, Det. Javier Baez said. In Broward, gun owners must fill out paperwork and pay a filing fee that generally ranges between $55 and $300 depending on the cost of their gun. It usually takes 30 to 45 days to get a hearing. If the law enforcement agency doesn’t object, then a mediator signs off and the judge grants the order. Donna Johnson, manager of county civil court, estimated Broward has about six to 10 such hearings a year. In Hillsborough, which doesn’t charge the gun owners a fee, the judge may ask the person to describe what happened that led to the Baker Act evaluation and some other questions, said Jason Gordillo, Hillsborough sheriff’s office legal counsel who has handled such cases for 10 years. The judge looks for any legal grounds that would ban the person from getting their gun back -- for example a convicted felon or someone with a domestic violence injunction. Usually after a brief hearing the judge issues the order to return the gun. "They can pick it up that day if they want," Gordillo said. The same procedures are used in cases that involved other law enforcement agencies within Hillsborough, he said. The Pasco County Sheriff's Office doesn’t have a written policy but handles these matters on a case-by-case basis, spokesman Kevin Doll said. He said the usual requirements for return of a gun include Baker Act hospital discharge records, a letter from a licensed mental health professional stating the person is of sound mind and he is of no harm if the firearm is returned to him, and proof of ownership. "We cannot compel a person to provide their medical records (HIPAA rules), but if they want their weapons back without a court order, they must provide the requested documents," Doll told PolitiFact in an email. Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office handles such matters on a case-by-case basis and does not have a written policy. "We often have told them to get a court order to retrieve the weapon, but again, technically nothing in the law allows us to require a court order," Sgt. David DiSano said. When a Baker Act leads to a commitment Ryan’s claim related to when someone is released after a Baker Act evaluation after 72 hours -- and therefore isn’t committed (even though he used the word committed). But we also wondered if someone can get their gun back if they are committed for longer treatment. Individuals who had been committed may petition the court to restore their gun rights and the court must rule in their favor if it determines the person is not a threat to public safety. (The state attorney can object.) Baker Act and background checks Before ringing up a gun sale, federal firearms licensees must contact the FBI or other designated agency to check National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to see if the person is banned from having a gun. (Read about the gaps in this reporting system here.) Since an evaluation under the Baker Act does not equal commitment, it is not entered into the FBI’s database. Any person who has been "adjudicated as a mental defective" or "committed to a mental institution" is prohibited under federal law from possessing any firearm. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also maintains a similar database based on court records. Some people who have a Baker Act evaluation do have mental illness, but they also can stabilize and remain functional throughout their lives, said Lenderman. She said the state needs more clear public policy on when to take -- and when to give back -- guns taken in Baker Act cases. "Simply having a diagnosis of a medical disorder, which it is, should not deprive you of constitutional rights unless certain criteria have been met," she said. "The law only says if you have a commitment of a court for involuntary placement is that going to take place. ... I hate to see further stigmatization of people with mental illness as though they are all dangerous people -- that is just flat out not true." Blanket policies that attempt to stop people with mental illness from obtaining guns can be both overinclusive and underinclusive, said Ron Honberg, a director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The key is identifying people who are violent -- not simply those who have a mental illness. Some of the shooters in recent mass shootings were unknown to the mental health system and therefore wouldn’t have been on such a banned list anyway, he said. "I understand the knee-jerk let’s keep guns out of the hands of all people with mental illness (but) it's pretty complicated." We asked Ryan how he thinks Florida law should handle people who have had a Baker Act evaluation and access to guns. "The law should require that someone who has been Baker Acted to prove by some standard they are mentally fit to have their guns returned and in the interim be prohibited from purchasing weapons," he wrote in an email. We asked Ryan to explain why he wrote that the guns are returned "automatically and immediately upon discharge" if many cities actually require a court order. "If the AG opinion is read that such ‘property’ can not be withheld, then the return would be automatic … that is, without restriction. Immediacy would be without the delay of court hearings or evaluation by mental professionals and upon request. There would be no reason for delay. They can walk out of the institution, go to the police department and request return immediately," he wrote. "That is the import of the AG's opinion." Our ruling Ryan made a two-part claim about the Baker Act and guns. First, he said "Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours..." Those who are released after a Baker Act evaluation are entitled to get their guns back, the state’s former attorney general wrote in an opinion. Many law enforcement agencies require a court order, a process than can take several weeks. The second part of Ryan’s claim, "and their commitment is never entered into a background check database," is close to correct. It would be more accurate to say that "their evaluation under the Baker Act is never entered into a background check database." An evaluation itself is not commitment, and therefore the law stating that a commitment would preclude someone from having a weapon doesn’t apply. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07668	Says it’s a "statistical reality that most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/10/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-single-moms-very-poor-under-edu/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a possible contender for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, caused a firestorm when he criticized movie star Natalie Portman. Speaking to conservative radio host Michael Medved, Huckabee said, "One of the things that is troubling is that people see a Natalie Portman or some other Hollywood starlet who boasts of, 'Hey look, we're having children, we're not married, but we're having these children, and they're doing just fine.’ But there aren't really a lot of single moms out there who are making millions of dollars every year for being in a movie." After the comment hit the wider airwaves, Huckabee posted the following comment on the website of HuckPac, his political action committee. "In a recent media interview about my new book, A Simple Government, I discussed the first chapter, ‘The Most Important Form of Government Is a Father, Mother, and Children,’" he wrote. "I was asked about Oscar-winner Natalie Portman's out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Natalie is an extraordinary actor, very deserving of her recent Oscar, and I am glad she will marry her baby's father. However, contrary to what the Hollywood media reported, I did not ‘slam’ or ‘attack’ Natalie Portman, nor did I criticize the hardworking single mothers in our country. My comments were about the statistical reality that most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death. That's the story that we're not seeing, and it's unfortunate that society often glorifies and glamorizes the idea of having children out of wedlock." A reader suggested we check into the "statistical reality" of single mothers. So we did. The best statistics we found to analyze this issue come from a Census Bureau data set called "America’s Families and Living Arrangements: 2010." One way of analyzing the question comes from a table of statistics detailing living arrangements for children under 18 years and the marital status of their parents. These statistics, released in November 2010, offer per-child data. Other tables look at the data from the point of view of the households, rather than the children. Either way, the statistics are broadly similar. We’ll take Huckabee’s claims one by one. "Most single moms are very poor." While only a minority of children in single-mother households officially live below the poverty level, the income picture still isn’t rosy. All told, 43 percent of such children are officially in households below the poverty level, and an additional 28 percent are in households that earn less than twice the poverty level. Less than a third -- 30 percent -- live in households that earn more than that. By contrast, only 13 percent children in dual-parent households (whether married or not) live in households that are at or below the poverty level. An additional 19 percent live in households that have less than twice the poverty level. A full 68 percent live in households with incomes double the poverty level or higher. Looked at by household, slightly under 40 percent of single-mother households are officially below the poverty level. There is no accepted definition of "very poor," so the claim is hard to nail down. But children in single-mother households are more than twice as likely as those in dual-parent households to be part of families that earn less than twice the poverty level. So Huckabee has a point on this statistic. Most single moms are "under-educated." Like "very poor," the term "under-educated" is somewhat subjective. But we’ll look at the educational patterns for single moms and dual-parent households. Nineteen percent of children in single-mother households have a mom who failed to earn a high-school diploma, compared to 67 percent who graduated high school and/or attended some college, and 14 percent who have a college degree or higher. The comparable figures for children in dual-parent households is 8 percent with less than a high-school diploma, 47 percent with a high school degree and/or some college, and 45 percent with a college degree or higher. So it’s true that children with single moms are more than twice as likely those of dual-parent households to be the child of a high-school dropout. On the other hand, a full 81 percent of children of single moms have a mom who graduated from high school. That’s lower than the 92 percent rate for dual-parent households, but it still seems a stretch to say that "most" single moms are "under-educated." Most single moms "can't get a job." In single-mother households, 74 percent of moms are considered "in the labor force," compared to 26 percent who are "not in the labor force." Being "in the labor" force means that you are either working or are trying to. So we have to look to a separate statistic from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see whether single moms are actually being employed, rather than merely trying. The data shows that in 2009, about 66 percent of single moms were employed, with an unemployment rate of 13.6 percent. (The employment rate was higher and the unemployment rate was lower the previous year, before the worst of the recession hit.) How does employment compare between single moms and married moms? According to calculations for PolitiFact by Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, the data show that single moms are actually likelier to work than married moms. For mothers with the youngest child under age 6, nearly 68 percent are in the labor force -- that is, either working or looking for work. The comparable number for married moms living with their spouses is 62 percent. For those with the youngest child between 6 and 17 years of age, 79 percent of single moms were in the labor force, compared to 77 percent of married moms. Burtless found that rates of actual employment are also very close between the two groups. "The crucial thing he missed -- and that many Republicans don’t seem to understand -- is that a lot of those mothers do work," said Ron Haskins, who as a Republican congressional staffer helped write the 1996 welfare reform bill. "The government has done a lot to basically force them to work. That was the essence of welfare reform." So, any way you look at it, a large majority of single moms are both part of the workforce and are successful at getting jobs. On this statistic, Huckabee is completely off base. "If it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death." Among children with single mothers, 41 percent get food stamps and 59 percent don’t. By contrast, 11 percent in dual-parent households get food stamps and 89 percent do not. Meanwhile, 10 percent of children in single-mother households get other kinds of cash assistance while 90 percent do not. For those in dual-parent households, 2 percent get cash assistance and 98 percent do not. (The statistics can vary depending on how you define cash assistance; we’re going by the Census Bureau’s definition.) Looked at by household, 32 percent of single-mother households get food stamps, while 16 percent get cash assistance. So while the rates of food stamp and public assistance use are certainly higher among single-mother households, they still represent a minority of single-mother households. It seems like a stretch for Huckabee to say that "most" kids of single-mother households would starve without public assistance. "Single mothers are a highly disadvantaged group in many ways," said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "But they are not quite so badly off as Huckabee says. In fact, a large majority of them are managing to remain gainfully employed even in the depths of this terrible economy." What is meant by 'single mothers'? Douglas J. Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor who was previously a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the numbers we found didn't surprise him much, though he did note that some people use the term "single mother" to mean "mother who had a child while single." To be extra cautious, we checked out this category separately. The best number we could find to approximate that group was the "never married" statistic, which excludes mothers who became single as a result of being widowed, separated, divorced or abandoned by a spouse. We found that the numbers are somewhat more dire for this subgroup than they are for single mothers as a whole, but not dramatically so. On education, 24 percent had less than a high-school diploma, compared to 19 percent for all single moms. Food stamp use was 50 percent, compared to 41 percent for all single moms, and 14 percent got public assistance, compared to 10 percent for all single moms. A full 70 percent of never-married single moms were in the work force, compared to 74 percent for all single moms. The one factor that showed the biggest variation was poverty. More than half -- 51 percent -- of never-married single moms are officially at the poverty line, and an additional 26 percent are between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level. That compares to 43 percent of all single moms officially below the poverty level and an additional 28 percent at less than twice the poverty level. But this was already the statistic where Huckabee was closest to being right. Our conclusion Even if the numbers for never-married moms had been dramatically different, we don't think it would justify Huckabee's comment, since the his wording didn’t distinguish among types of single moms. We should also note that Portman has said she plans to marry the baby’s father, so she would actually fit best into the "living with both parents, not married to each other" category, which we included in our "dual-parent household" category, not the "single-mother" category. So where does this leave us? There’s a pretty strong case that Huckabee is right about poverty in single-mother households. But his claims about educational attainment and government assistance are exaggerated, and the majority of kids living with single moms put food on the table without public assistance. And one claim is flat-out wrong -- that single moms aren’t able to get jobs. Lots of single mothers do -- often in higher rates than married moms. On balance, we rate Huckabee’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00453	"Science says that being single will kill you faster than obesity."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/20/blog-posting/will-being-single-kill-you/	Finding a date can feel like a life or death situation. According to Wonderneed, an clickbait news site, it actually might be. An article has the headline, "Science says that being single will kill you faster than obesity." Facebook users shared the #relatable content over 9,000 times in less than a week. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We decided to find out if being single was a health risk. The danger of loneliness The article focuses on a 2017 press release about the 125th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Julianna Holt-Lunstad, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, gave a presentation about the public health hazard of loneliness. Her team analyzed 218 studies that examined the connection between social isolation and mortality. In these studies, researchers would track a group of subjects over the course of years. In some studies, participants would report how lonely they felt. In others, their loneliness was measured more objectively, based on the number of social connections an individual had or whether they lived alone. Holt-Lunstad and her team found that lonely people were 50 percent more likely to die during the period of observation than those with good social connections. For comparison, obese individuals have a 45 percent higher risk of death, based on a 2016 Harvard study. So, based on these stats, loneliness is just as much as, if not slightly more, of a health risk than obesity. The Wonderneed article, though, doesn’t say loneliness is more dangerous than obesity; it says being single is. Holt-Lunstad’s study didn’t focus on romance. Romantic relationships were included as social connections, she explained to us, but the result "wasn’t specific to being single." Based solely on her meta-analysis, the article cannot conclude that a lack of romance is the health risk. Phew. The speed of death The headline also mischaracterizes what these stats mean in practice. It claims that being single "will kill you faster" than obesity. The mere act of being single is not killing anyone. It is the loneliness associated with being single that might carry the risk. Second, none of these studies mention the element of time. Researchers measured the number of isolated people who died over the course of the study and compared it to the number of well-connected people who died. Because significantly more isolated people passed away, they concluded that loneliness was a health risk. The same method would be used to measure the risk of obesity: If 15 percent of the obese sample died, and only 3 percent of the non-obese sample did, researchers would know that obesity was a health risk. It is misleading to say that one would kill faster than the other. All the single ladies = all the lonely ladies? While the Wonderneed claim is incorrect, we’re sure you’re wondering: Are single people at a higher risk for death than those who are married? Other research has taken on the question of romance and health more directly. A study from 2011 showed that single people had a 24 percent increased risk for mortality. Especially within younger, healthier age groups, a single person is significantly more likely to die than someone married. Researchers found that, among 30-somethings, being single increased health risks by 128 percent. It’s unclear why this phenomenon exists. It could be because risk-takers are less likely to marry, and more likely to do stupid nonsense (emphasis ours). Or, unmarried people may have less access to health care and resources that married couples have. Perhaps, seriously ill people are getting married less often than healthy people, so it just seems like singles are more likely to die. Regardless of the underlying reason, though, the statistics paint a dark future for the unlucky-in-love. The health risks for being single are lower than those of being lonely or obese, but still significant. Our ruling The article by Wonderneed claimed that "science says being single will kill you faster than obesity." But the article cites an analysis on loneliness, not on romantic relationships. Studies have shown that loneliness can be a significant health concern, increasing a person’s risk of death by 50 percent. This is a higher rate than that of obesity, which increases health risks by 45 percent. But none of the studies actually examine the speed at which someone dies. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-09676	The United States has a supply of "more than 100 years of natural gas."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/18/american-natural-gas-alliance/industry-group-claims-we-have-100-years-worth-natu/	With Congress debating cap-and-trade legislation, we've seen a lot of television ads promoting the benefits of various fuels: coal, wind, solar -- you name it. Recently, an ad sponsored by America's Natural Gas Alliance caught our eye. In it, a mother tells her daughter that the United States has "more than 100 years of natural gas." That's a lot of natural gas, so we decided to look into the claim. America's Natural Gas Alliance, a group backed by the top natural gas producing companies in the nation, told us the figure came from a June 18, 2009, report by the Potential Gas Committee, a panel associated with the Colorado School of Mines and financially supported by the natural gas industry. According to the committee, the nation has about 2,074 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Most of it is in the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, the Atlantic Coast and the Midwest. That figure includes 238 trillion cubic feet of proved gas reserves as established by the Energy Department and about 1,836 trillion cubic feet of what the school calls technically recoverable natural gas. Let's pause to go over some energy nomenclature. The phrase "technically recoverable" has to do with how much natural gas is available using current technology; this is the amount of natural gas the Potential Gas Committee looked at. The term "proved reserves" is used to describe natural gas that is economically viable, and usually reflects sources that have already been tapped by natural gas companies. Proved reserves are tracked by the government through Securities and Exchange Commission filings because natural gas companies list their sources as capital assets. Recently, reserve estimates have been on the rise due to the extraction of gas from shale deposits, rock that holds natural gas and was, until recently, relatively expensive and difficult to harvest. If you multiply 23 trillion cubic feet, the amount of natural gas used annually in the United States, by 100, you get 2,300 trillion -- roughly the amount the Colorado School of Mines has estimated. So, by one standard, America's natural Gas Alliance is in the ballpark. However, by another standard the group is pretty far off; the United States Geological Survey and the Minerals Management Survey say there's only about 1,162.7 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas available, a total of 1,400 trillion metric tons when paired with the government's proved reserve estimate. Using the same math, there's only about 61 years of natural gas in the United States. What's more, energy experts we spoke with said that America's Natural Gas Alliance's use of technically recoverable estimates should come with an important caveat. "Right now, we are awash in natural gas," said Vincent Matthews, Colorado's state geologist. "But it's not about the reserves or resources. It's about how fast we can get it out of the ground and whether it's economically viable." Indeed, the price of natural gas has hovered around $4 per million British thermal units over the last few months, while the price of the same unit of oil has been as high as $9 more during the same period, according to the Energy Information Administration. So, relatively low natural gas prices might be good for consumers, but they don't make production cost-effective for producers, Miller said. Richard Heinberg, a senior fellow at the Post Carbon Institute, echoed the concern. One hundred years "is a hugely inflated number," he said. "What price does natural gas have to be at to justify extraction? It needs to be $8 or more." So, by one estimate, the natural gas industry is correct that we have about 100 years' worth of natural gas. But another estimate disputes that total. Furthermore, geologists and energy experts warn that the higher number is somewhat misleading because it includes natural gas that is not economicaly viable to extract. Given that those important elements were not mentioned in the commercial, we give America's Natural Gas Alliance a Half True.

pomt-13357	Says Hillary Clinton has "taken hundreds of millions from those countries" where "women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery and women can't drive."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/oct/02/rudy-giuliani/fact-checking-rudy-giuliani-meet-press/	Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says Hillary Clinton is only pretending to be a feminist. On NBC’s Meet the Press Oct. 2, Giuliani criticized the Democratic presidential nominee for "attacking" women who have accused her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of sexual abuse. He also brought up Hillary Clinton’s record on human rights. "A woman who pretends to be a feminist shouldn't be taking money from countries where women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery, and women can't drive," Giuliani said. "She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries." Giuliani was referring to the Clinton Foundation, which has brought in significant amounts of money from foreign entities and governments to fund its international charitable programs. One of the biggest concerns about the Clinton Foundation is that some of this foreign money came from countries with questionable records on human rights, as well as countries that had business before the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. On this particular claim, though, Giuliani stretches the truth. The donations from the countries in question do not come close to "hundreds of millions" of dollars. And the money goes to the foundation, not to Clinton. Giuliani specifically mentioned countries where women are stoned, killed for adultery and can’t drive. By our count — using the State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Cornell University’s death penalty database — we found four countries who fall loosely into these categories: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Here’s a chart laying out those countries’ stance on adultery, stoning and women driving, and donations to the Clinton Foundation. (The foundation lists donors on its website, organized into groups based on the size of the donation, without giving the specific dollar amount.) Country Donation to Clinton Foundation Women’s rights issues Saudi Arabia $10 million - $25 million Women are not allowed to drive. Adultery is illegal, and perpetrators can be sentenced to death by stoning. Kuwait $5 million - $10 million Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery. United Arab Emirates $1 million - $5 million Sharia courts allow flogging as a punishment for adultery, and stoning is a form of execution. Bahrain $50,000 - $100,000 Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery. In total, the Clinton Foundation brought in between $16.05 million and $40.1 million. That’s not a small number, but it’s nowhere near "hundreds of millions." Saudi Arabia is the clearest example of what Giuliani is talking about, and it donated a maximum of $25 million. We should note that outside the narrow band of countries that ban women from driving and stone them for adultery, a few other countries with other women’s rights issues donated to the Clinton Foundation. For example, Qatar, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, allows for flogging (non-lethal) as a punishment for adultery. And Brunei, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, specifically says spousal intercourse cannot be considered rape. But even if you expand the group of foundation donors to countries that have significant women’s rights issues generally, the donations do not amount to "hundreds of millions" of dollars. It’s also important to note Giuliani’s phrasing. He said, "She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries," referring to Hillary Clinton herself. But the donations did not go to Clinton personally; they went to the foundation. While Clinton has been intimately involved in the foundation when not serving in the government or running for office, neither Clinton nor her political campaigns have ever received a direct monetary benefit, such as a salary, from the foundation. Our ruling Giuliani said Hillary Clinton has "taken hundreds of millions from those countries" where "women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery and women can't drive." The Clinton Foundation, not Clinton personally, has taken in tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions, from countries that have questionable records on women’s rights, including those that ban driving and stone women for adultery. Giuliani’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12064	Says Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton "all voted for" a border wall as senators.	half-true	/california/statements/2017/sep/06/jeff-denham/jeff-denhams-half-true-claim-top-democrats-support/	On the day the Trump administration announced it will end the so-called Dreamer program in six months, California Congressman Jeff Denham floated the idea for a bill that could further secure the border and protect undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. "This is certainly an opportunity to combine a Dreamer Act with border security," Denham, a Republican who represents the Modesto area, told NPR on Sept. 5, 2017. "This is something that should have bipartisan support. The president’s already asking for border security, why wouldn’t we add a Dreamer aspect to that as well?" The administration’s action affects about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Roughly a quarter of these ‘Dreamers’ live in California. The Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, has allowed them to continue to live and work in the U.S. temporarily, following a vetting process. President Trump gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution to DACA before the administration formally ends it. In his interview with Rachael Martin of NPR, Denham went on to claim that a DACA/border bill shouldn’t be controversial because top Democrats have supported border security, and specifically a border wall, in years past. MARTIN: "When you say border security, you’re talking about the wall? What do you mean by that?" DENHAM: "Yes, yes. Which was bipartisan back when (then) Sen. Obama, Sen. Schumer and (then) Sen. Clinton all voted for it. This used to be a very bipartisan thing before President Trump announced it. I think it can be bipartisan once again." Denham is citing votes by the Democrats in 2006 on an act that authorized a fence. It’s a claim that takes things out of context and was repeated multiple times by Donald Trump during his campaign for president and was made in April by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney. After he spoke with NPR, Denham repeated the idea of a combined border security and DACA bill in an interview on Capital Public Radio. In that interview, he called border security a bipartisan idea but did not directly call Trump’s wall bipartisan or reveal whether he favors that specific proposal. As PolitiFact has noted several times in the past, the fence voted on in 2006 was less ambitious than the ‘big, beautiful wall’ Trump has pitched over the past two years and promised Mexico would pay for. Here’s PolitiFact’s analysis of this topic: The Secure Fence Act of 2006 The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. At the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.) Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Currently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) So how does that compare to Trump’s wall? Trump plans for the wall are vague, but here’s what we know. He said the wall doesn’t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. Cost estimates by others, including this one cited by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., vary widely. Experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people. Still, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trump’s wall proposal. A 2016 Associated Press report from the border described "rust-colored thick bars" that form "teeth-like slats" 18 feet high. "There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself," the report said. Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign. "Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad," Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) It’s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Ever since Trump proposed his wall during the presidential campaign, Democrats have called it overkill and too expensive. Meanwhile, PolitiFact California asked Denham’s spokeswoman for evidence to support the claim. She pointed to the votes by Obama, Clinton and Schumer in 2006. This isn’t the first time Denham has made a puzzling claim about ‘bipartisan’ efforts in Congress. In May, he told town hall attendees that the process that led to the GOP health care bill, passed exclusively by House Republicans, was "bipartisan." We found it was a poor choice of words given how little cooperation there was over the bill. Experts told us it applied only in the most bare bones sense that both Republicans and Democrats had a chance to read and scrutinize the bill in committees. Our ruling Denham recently claimed that Obama, Schumer and Clinton voted for a border wall in 2006. They did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. Still, the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a "nothing wall." PolitiFact has rated several similar claims Half True, noting they are partially accurate but ignore important context. Denham’s claim also gets it about half right, but leaves out key information. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-11937	Says a proposed $1.05 billion Austin school district bond proposition "will require no tax rate increase."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/12/committee-austins-children-pac/claim-about-proposed-austin-school-bonds-silent-in/	A handout urging voter support for a proposed $1.05 billion Austin school district bond issue on the November 2017 ballot singles out the need to repair and renovate schools averaging 40 years of age plus a desire to modernize or build 16 schools. Moreover, the handout from the Committee of Austin’s Children PAC says: "Did you know? AISD Prop. 1 bonds will require no tax rate increase," a claim the group also makes on its website. Is that rate statement accurate? To rehash, the handout says the sought bonds won’t require a "rate" increase. It’s silent on whether district residents will pay more in taxes if the proposition passes--which struck Austin lawyer Bill Aleshire, formerly Travis County’s elected judge, as misleading. Aleshire, who brought the handout to our attention, said by email: "No one in their right mind should believe AISD can borrow $1 billion plus interest and not have a property tax increase as a result." When we asked, David Butts, a consultant to the PAC, told us by phone the group based its rate claim on district presentations. Butts said: "We’ve never said that you wouldn’t pay higher taxes," in that barring an economic recession, escalating local property values stand to drive up how much the district reaps--without the district needing a rate bump. Property taxes are tied to assessed property values which in Austin (like other prosperous cities) lately spiral nearly every year. In this fact-check, we’ll share assumptions behind the no-hike scenario and unpack estimates of how much money the proposed bonds would likely cost homeowners in increased tax bills. It’s also worth noting the speculative quality of tax predictions. To our inquiry, Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Union, which opposes the proposition, questioned anyone’s ability to fact-check rate-related claims because, he said by phone, tax effects depend on unknowns including whether and how much total appraised property values change and if the district’s intended debt repayment schedules and interest rates bear out. "You cannot assume it’s a sunny day every day," Falk said. "It’s going to rain sometime." Austin district’s assumptions District leaders have said that presuming total assessed property values continue to increase and also that the district repays more than half the proposed debt within a decade, the school board will be spared from considering an increase in the district’s total tax rate of $1.192 per $100 valuation--the bulk of which covers day-to-day maintenance and operations. A September 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story elaborated: "The district points to its last bond election — $392 million approved by voters in 2013 — as an example of how it can tamp down the impact on property tax bills. Those bonds were expected to raise the tax rate by 3 cents, or about $38.40 a year to the property tax bill for a $200,000 home. "But instead," the story said, "the district, buoyed by increasing property values, lowered the tax rate by 5 cents per $100 of a home’s assessed value. Homeowners are still paying more, of course, because property values in Austin have shot up 12 percent a year, on average, for the past five years." Tiffany Young, a district spokeswoman, emailed us the district’s August 2017 "tax capacity analysis" of the proposed bond costs, which included a summary of annual changes--of late 11-percent-plus annual increases--in total assessed property valuations in the district from 2008 through 2017: SOURCE: Document showing tax capacity analysis of proposed bond debt, Austin Independent School District, Aug. 10, 2017 (received by email from Tiffany Young, senior communication specialist, AISD, Sept. 26, 2017) That news story noted that the district’s payback plan for the proposed bond package assumes an annual increase in total assessed property values of 7 percent in the first two years and 1.5 percent for each subsequent year. "Property values actually have a 10-year average growth rate of nearly 8 percent," the story said. School leaders advised that if there’s a flattening in property-value increases, the district could tap $46 million in reserves, or savings, to make up for lost revenue. Also, the story quoted Ellen Wood, who chairs the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce’s board of directors, calling district assumptions behind no tax-rate hike prediction "conservative and appropriate." By phone, Wood told us chamber members based that judgment on talks with the district’s chief financial officer, Nicole Conley Johnson, and a firm advising the district on the proposed issuance. To our inquiries, Conley Johnson reaffirmed the district’s conclusion that the proposed bonds can be paid off without a tax-rate hike. In fact, Conley Johnson said by phone, she expects the district to land interest rates perhaps 2 percentage points less than the 5 percent rate assumed in its modeling, a decrease that would reduce repayment costs. Noting increased assessed property valuations in recent years, Conley Johnson also said it’s reasonable to expect assessed values to surge more each year than the 1.5 percent rate assumed in the modeling past the first couple years. If the proposition fails at the polls, Conley Johnson confirmed, the school board could reduce the debt portion of the district tax rate in 2021-22 by $0.0297 per $100 valuation to $0.0833 with additional reductions doable most subsequent years through 2039-40--though that scenario depends, perhaps improbably, on no additional costs accumulating in the intervening years. If the proposition passes, Conley Johnson said, in 2022, the district will need some $35.5 million to pay incremental costs on the proposed bonds. An estimated $35.5 million would be raised by from that $0.0297 per $100 valuation in tax rate, the district projects. Worst-case scenarios? We separately asked Conley Johnson and Chris Allen of First Southwest, the firm hired by the district as financial advisers on the proposition, to lay out a worst-case scenario that might cause district officials to recommend a rate increase after all. "You’d have to have a major economic downturn," Allen said by phone. "You’d have to have the housing market plummet." Allen, referring to the district’s assumed 7 percent increases in total assessed valuations in both 2019 and 2020, said: "I think the 7 percent is conservative. If you look around, there are cranes everywhere. The housing" and commercial "market is on fire." Conley Johnson said by email: "We estimate that if" total assessed valuation "growth stayed flat for the next 8 years or there was a cumulative decline in AV of 20%, we would need to consider increasing the tax rate. Of course." she said, "these events would buck historical trends of the last 10 years where there was only year that AV declined, in 2011 due to the national recession--arguably the worst in history. Even still, there was subsequent growth thereafter and the decline was made-up after two years and growth doubled after that." Falk, the proposition foe, questioned the assumption that the district can repay the bonds at a 5 percent interest rate past this next year. "There’s no science--no way to know--past one year," Falk said. Falk called the assumed annual increases in total property valuations a "best guess." We also asked Charles Gilliland, a land-market expert at Texas A&M University, to evaluate the no-rate-increase claim. Gilliland said by phone the district’s post-2020 assumption that total assessed property values will increase 1.5 percent annually seems "pretty conservative. The rest of the story is it’s not going to be a nice steady increase," Gilliland said. "There are going to be ups and downs." Generally, Gilliland said by email: "Without exhaustive historical studies of the parameters of their model and an examination of the operating conditions of the district, I have no evidence to cast doubt on the assumptions underlying the" district’s analysis. Costs to taxpayers Falk called the tax-rate claim by itself a "head fake" intended to dupe voters into overlooking that each taxpayer would be paying more dollars to cover bond repayments. He also emailed us the taxpayer group’s analysis, which provides estimated effects on property tax bills by assuming that total assessed valuations within district boundaries won’t go up or down. Then again, the district has acknowledged that property owners will pay more in taxes to pay debt service on the bonds, if approved. A June 2017 American-Statesman news story on school board members voting to place the proposition before voters initially noted that district officials said the tax rate would remain flat at $1.192 per $100 of assessed property value, with $1.079 designated for operations and $0.113 of the rate going toward repaying debt issued to fund capital improvements. Still: "For the owner of the district’s average taxable value home of $355,947, the school tax bills would total nearly $4,243. As properties increase in value," the story said, "that same tax rate would lead to increasingly higher tax bills." District web pages devoted to the proposition similarly indicate property owners will likely face increases in what the district bills. We initially spotted no estimates of how much more, but estimates were provided when we asked. Let’s cover those web posts, then turn to what the district gave us. Here’s a question on the district’s main FAQ section about the proposition: "I've heard AISD say this bond will not raise my property tax rate. How is that possible?" The 202-word reply stresses the district’s plan not to issue the sought debt all at once plus plans to draw on other funds; it doesn’t concede additional direct-to-taxpayer bond costs. We saw this question on a separate district Finance FAQ web page about the proposition: "So does this mean that I won’t have an increase in my tax bill?" The district’s reply opens, "No." That reply otherwise says higher taxes depend on the appraised value of taxable property, "which is determined by the" Travis Central Appraisal District, "not AISD. An increase or decrease in taxable property value, even with no change in the tax rate, would result in an increase or decrease in the actual amount of taxes paid." The reply goes on to note that residents who qualify for Travis County’s over-65 homestead exemption wouldn’t pay more in school taxes. Moreover, the reply continues, other governing entities levy property taxes including the city of Austin, Travis County, the Austin Community College District and the Travis County Health Care District. "The rates for each entity are set annually by the elected or governing officials," the district says. "The rate for each of the taxing entities is then applied to your home value," it says. We also noticed the last, 18th question on the district’s main FAQ page for the proposition: "What's the bottom line, the one thing you want voters to know?" The district’s reply: "AISD needs to address facility deficiencies and is committed to creating 21st-century learning spaces for our students. We can do so without a tax rate increase." Conley Johnson told us that in 2021-22 (the third year of the district starting to sell and repay the bond debt being presented to voters), the cost to taxpayers of the new debt would range from $29.70 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $100,000 up to $297 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $1 million. See the district’s full chart here. According to what Conley Johnson described as the district’s worst-case modeling of the proposed bonds’ effect on taxes, the owner of an Austin homestead at the average 2017-18 assessed value ($332,103) would see the debt portion of her or his district tax bill increase from $375 in 2017-18 to $484 in 2027-28--driven by expected bumps in assessed property values. Absent the sought bonds or other approved debt, this modeling indicates, the 2027-28 costs to such a homeowner for district debt would total $250.57. An owner of a homestead at the 2017-18 median value ($262,282) would face $382.75 in district debt-tied taxes in 2027-28--up from $296 in 2017-18 and greater than the $197.89 in such taxes the homeowner would face if the district doesn’t issue additional debt. There’s more: As we made our inquiries, the district posted a document estimating each homesteading homeowner’s future tax payments to the district related to paying off the proposed bonds. Upshot: Starting in 2022, some $0.0297 per $100 valuation of the district’s tax rate would generate sufficient revenue to pay debt service on the sought bonds, the document says. The share of the district’s tax rate needed to pay that debt service will escalate in subsequent years, the document says, with that share reaching its maximum of $0.0530 per $100 valuation as of 2029. According to the document, the district estimates the dollar costs in annual taxes on the median-value homestead in the district--which in 2017 had an appraised value of $287,282--to be $77.90 in 2022 and $139.01 in 2029. At the upper end, the estimated annual dollar costs due to debt service on the proposed bonds to a homestead appraised at $1 million in 2017 is shown as $289.58 in 2022, $516.75 in 2029. Our ruling The PAC said the proposed Austin school district bonds "will require no tax rate increase." Missing from this claim: Individual homeowners are expected to pay more in property taxes even if the tax rate remains the same, which looks likely thanks to rising property valuations in a hot real-estate market.

pomt-06848	Says Sen. Robert Cowles, her recall opponent, supported the sale of state-owned power plants "not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors" with no oversight.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/04/nancy-nusbaum/candidate-nancy-nusbaum-says-state-sen-robert-cowl/	Two Democrats working to knock off Wisconsin state senators in recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011, are reviving the short-lived controversy over Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to sell off state-owned power plants. In a strongly worded TV ad, Nancy Nusbaum and Fred Clark pair up to accuse their respective opponents, GOP senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, of an abuse of power -- or at least an attempted one. "Power. We gave it to senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, then they tried to sell it," intones a narrator in the ad. "Supporting the sale of Wisconsin’s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption." Two contested races, a high-stakes election and a provocative claim -- in other words, right up our alley. Because the case against each is slightly different, we are looking at them in separate items. You can find the Clark vs. Olsen analysis here. So, did Cowles support selling the plants to the biggest campaign donors with no oversight? Walker’s budget-repair bill, proposed in February 2011, would have allowed a no-bid sale of up to 37 heating and cooling plants, primarily at University of Wisconsin campuses. Walker said the sale would avoid costly plant upgrades at taxpayer expense. The clause immediately triggered accusations that Walker was setting up a deal to benefit Koch Industries, which the Journal Sentinel reported was the largest corporate contributor to Walker in the 2010 campaign. At the time, Koch Industries denied any interest in the plants. The power-plant controversy all but died out amid the massive protests over Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. In fact, the power-plant sale provision was removed from the bill in the chaotic endgame that allowed Republican senators to approve the collective-bargaining changes without the Democrats who had fled to Illinois to block a quorum. Let’s look at the three components of the claim: Supporting the no-bid sale approach. Cowles is not a member of the Joint Finance Committee and never had a chance to vote on the version of the repair bill that included the no-bid language. And records show that version never came to a vote in the full Senate in February because the Democrats were AWOL. The Assembly, which went first, passed the bill when it included the no-bid language. Furthermore, in March, shortly after the Legislature passed the stripped-down repair bill lacking the power-plant action, Cowles took the lead in explaining he and other Republicans had asked that it be taken out. In 2005, Republicans also pushed for sale of the plants, trying to insert it into the budget. When the matter came up at Joint Finance -- which at that time included Cowles -- he opposed adding it into the budget. (It ultimately went in over their objections but was vetoed by then-Gov. Jim Doyle). It’s worth noting, however, that Cowles had the chance in February to amend Walker’s budget-repair bill -- or push for an alternative being shopped around by Sen. Dale Schultz, R-Richland Center. Schultz was talking about requiring deeper concessions from public employees than Walker's budget-repair plan but preserving more of workers' collective bargaining rights. Schultz’s plans, however, could not have come to a vote unless the Senate Democrats returned. Schultz told us the no-bid aspect of the power plant sale would have been removed in his alternative budget plan. So where did Cowles come down on Schultz’s plan? The state Democratic Party, responding on behalf of the two Democrats, pointed us to a Cowles comment about Schultz’s plan in a Feb. 26, 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. "I'm prepared to vote for the bill as it is," said Cowles, referring to Walker’s bill -- which included the no-bid clause. But the rest of the quote is: "If something like this (plan by Schultz) happens, I could vote for this too because it gets you 80% to 90% of what you want." Supporting a sale of the plants to the "biggest donors." This is an apparent reference to campaign donors. It’s true that Koch or Wisconsin utilities who have given to Walker and Republicans could have emerged as buyers and purchased state plants. And they may have had an easier road without a formal bidding process. But contrary to the dramatic accusation in the TV ad, the language in the bill didn’t select any winners, much less winners who are fat-cat campaign contributors. The bill would have authorized the no-bid sale, but who the ultimate bidders -- or buyers -- would be in that scenario can’t be known. Supporting the sale without any oversight. The original bill drew criticism in part because it went beyond the 2005 attempt by Republicans to sell the plants. That earlier effort would have required bids, and called for Public Service Commission review on whether the sale is in the public interest. The 2011 plan submitted by Walker did not include those steps. But amid the criticism, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee beefed up the oversight, requiring that any proposed sale forwarded by Walker’s administration first go through the committee. Cowles was not on the committee during the current term and, as we noted, did not have a chance to vote on the provision at all. Let’s review. Democratic challenger Nusbaum in the heat of a recall race accused Cowles of "supporting the sale of Wisconsin’s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption." As evidence, they cite part of a quote by Cowles. Some viewers -- perhaps most -- may assume from the ad that Cowles actually voted to sell the plants to a big campaign donor. The ad is misleading on that score alone. It would have allowed a no-bid process for the sale, but did not designate any specific buyer. Beyond that, the ad has other problems. Cowles never even had a chance to vote on the plan in 2011, apparently backed taking it out and has a history of opposition to slipping the plan into the budget. These are readily available facts on a very high-profile issue, making the ad’s claims -- and its implication of a scandal -- ridiculous. Thus, we rate the claim from Nusbaum against Cowles as Pants on Fire.	None	Nancy Nusbaum	None	None	None	2011-08-04T19:11:47	2011-07-25	['None']
pomt-01699	"Having a baby is a leading cause of poverty spells in the United States."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/12/moms-rising/having-kid-leading-trigger-poverty/	Everyone knows that raising kids isn’t cheap. The latest estimate from the U.S. Agriculture Department says parents shell out over $240,000 for the average child by the time he or she is 18. For many families, that can be tough to manage, but a tweet from the advocacy group Moms Rising says the consequences can be very dire indeed. "Having a baby is a leading cause of poverty spells in the United States," the group tweeted on Aug. 5, 2014. Moms Rising supports paid family leave and boasts a membership of more than 1 million people. For proof, the group points to a 2012 article in The Nation that said, "a quarter of all ‘poverty spells’— falling into poverty for two months or more at a time — begin with the birth of a child." The article did not cast the birth of a child as a leading reason a person would slip into poverty, but it did link to a 2001 report by Jane Waldvogel, a professor of social work and public affairs at Columbia University. Waldvogel’s language was a bit more cautious than what appeared in The Nation. "Recent estimates suggest that one quarter of all poverty spells in the United States begin with the birth of a new child," Waldvogel wrote. Waldvogel based that on 1998 data from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Here’s the key table: Percentage of First Poverty Spell Beginning by Event Event Spell Began 1973-79 Spell Began 1980-85 Spell Began 1986-91 First birth - single mom 4.2 5.8 7.3 First birth - other 2.3 4.5 2.3 Second birth and up 9.2 10.2 17.9 Sub-total births 15.7 20.5 27.5 Mom’s work hours dropped 500+ hours/year 12.5 21.4 28.6 Other adult’s work hours dropped 500+ hours/year - no change in family structure 29 27.7 27.7 Other adult’s work hours dropped 500+ hours/year - change in family structure 24.6 22.9 16.3 Sub-total work hours drop 66.1 72 72.6 Let’s take the period when having a child had the biggest impact. When we add up the percentages tied to the arrival of a new baby, we see the source of the 28 percent cited by Waldvogel. But while that’s a large number, it fails to prove that the birth of a child was a leading change that tipped people into poverty. Since we added up the numbers tied to births, it makes as much sense to to add up the numbers for another set of related events, loss of work hours. The total there is 72.6 percent, or more than twice as large as having a child. The original table included four more categories that caused a poverty spell, including divorce, moving or becoming injured and unable to work. The chart doesn’t add up to 100 percent because respondents could select more than one category that fit their situation. We asked Ann Huff Stevens, an economist and director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of California-Davis, what she made of these figures. "That, to me, suggests that pregnancy is not the leading cause of poverty," Stevens said. However, Stevens warned that no one should go too far down the path of adding up the percentages because the events are not mutually exclusive. In other words, one person could experience both the birth of a child and a loss of work hours or some other event. She did note that the 1986-91 period was unusual because no full recession took place in those years. Stevens said in good times, giving birth would play a bigger role as a poverty trigger because the other leading trigger, job loss, would be less common when the economy is doing well. A 2014 report from the Health and Human Services Department reaffirms the primacy of a job. The target group is different, single mothers who start receiving welfare payments, but the pattern is consistent with the 1998 table. In the 2004-06 period, the three leading events that put a woman into poverty were: Recipient’s earnings decreased (48.6 percent), Other household earnings decreased (23.8 percent), and New child in family (22.9 percent). Teasing out the most important events Part of the problem with the HHS table -- which is essentially the source for Moms Rising’s tweet -- is that the events that trigger poverty can overlap. This makes it difficult to say which is most important. But in 2002, analysts with the Urban Institute, an academic center in Washington, took the data files behind the HHS tables and used more sophisticated tools to assess how much each event -- by itself -- mattered. They calculated the likelihood of a person slipping into poverty if one of seven changes occurred. Event Likelihood of slipping into poverty Head of household loses employment 16.7% Shift from two-adult to female-headed household 15.3% Spouse loses employment 8.9% Another household member loses employment 7.2% Child under age 6 enters household 5.8% Head of household becomes disabled 5.8% Young adult sets up own household 4.6% One of the Urban Institute researchers, Caroline Ratcliffe, said having a child plays a role, but not a leading one. "The impact of having a child isn’t as large as losing a job," Ratcliffe said. "But in the different analyses, we find that it’s either as important or more important than the onset of a disability of the family head." Out of the seven events Ratcliffe assessed, having a child ranks in the bottom three and it is about a third as potent a factor as job loss. Sheldon Danziger, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and president of the Russell Sage Foundation, a group that funds poverty research, said the claim from Moms Rising puts too much weight on the wrong issue. "The primary problem is an economic one," Danziger said. "If you grow up poor and live in a bad neighborhood and go to a bad school and you are not likely to go to college, you are likely to be poor at age 20 whether or not you have had a child." Our ruling The advocacy group Moms Rising said having a baby is a major reason someone will slip into poverty. The evidence cited by Moms Rising goes back to 1998 and while one might say that having a child can trigger a spell of poverty about a quarter of the time, the impact of job loss is much greater. The most careful analysis separated the relative influence of different life changes. According to that, having a child ranks low and is much less important that changes in employment or shifting from a two-adult to a female-headed household. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11239	Says conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein is a Wisconsin resident.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/04/kevin-nicholson/what-makes-illinois-resident-wisconsin-resident/	Does a part-time residence in the Northwoods make a person a resident of Wisconsin? Kevin Nicholson thinks so. Nicholson, a Delafield businessman and U.S. Marine veteran, is battling state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield for the Republican nomination in the race to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in November 2018. The Nicholson campaign released a list of new Finance Committee Co-Chairs from throughout Wisconsin -- an effort to show wide-ranging support for his bid. Included in the release was a list of Nicholson for Senate committee members and their hometowns, including "Dick and Liz Uihlein (Minocqua)." Nicholson also tweeted the release on April 19, 2018, with this message "I’m honored to have an incredible committee as the outsider candidate for #wisen." Hold on a minute. Nicholson is touting himself as "the outsider candidate" by releasing a list of Wisconsin supporters. But aren’t Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein frequently referred to as Illinois residents? Residency Richard Uihlein is a well-known GOP mega-donor. An April 29, 2018, profile of Uihlein in The Washington Post said he has "risen to become one of the most powerful — and disruptive — GOP donors in the country." The article notes that Uihlein is a resident of Illinois, but has a substantial presence in Wisconsin politics: Richard Uihlein, a wealthy shipping-supplies magnate from Illinois who shuns the spotlight, has risen to become one of the most powerful — and disruptive — GOP donors in the country. Uihlein made his first major mark on the anti-union fight in Wisconsin in 2011, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend state senators in aggressive recall campaigns over their votes to end collective bargaining for public employees. That fight also marked the beginning of a friendship between Scott Walker and Uihlein, who was charmed by the Wisconsin governor over a dinner meeting at the Uihleins’ home. He became an instrumental supporter of the governor’s campaign against public unions. In an April 13, 2018, article, the Associated Press also noted the involvement of Uihlein in Wisconsin politics: The billionaire founder of shipping and packaging supply giant Uline Corp. continues to spend big on Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race in support of Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson. Richard Uihlein gave $500,000 last month to the newly formed Club for Growth Action Wisconsin super PAC, which supports Nicholson. Uihlein has given nearly $16 million since 2017 to eight groups that are supporting Nicholson in the Republican primary against state Sen. Leah Vukmir. Spending by the groups Uihlein supports has helped make the Senate race the most expensive in the country so far. So, Uihlein has a major footprint in Wisconsin politics. But that doesn’t make him a state resident. The evidence Numerous articles in a variety of publications, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, have referred to Uihlein as a Lake Forest, Ill., businessman who co-owns Uline Corp., based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis. The most solid piece of evidence is the Uihleins’ voter registration, which firmly identifies them as registered to vote in Illinois: Name: Richard E Uihlein Age: 72 Registration Status: Richard Uihlein IS REGISTERED TO VOTE in the State of Illinois. Name: Elizabeth A Uihlein Age: 72 Registration Status: Elizabeth Uihlein IS REGISTERED TO VOTE in the State of Illinois. To qualify for voter registration in Illinois, you must: Be a U.S. citizen. Be a resident of Illinois for at least 30 days. Be at least 18 years old (if you are 17 years old, can vote in the General Primary election IF they will be 18 years old on or before the General Election)(tighten for our sake here). NOT be registered to vote in another state. A search of the My Vote Wisconsin database turns up zero hits on searches for Richard Uihlein or Elizabeth Uihlein. So, why does Nicholson say the Uihleins are from Wisconsin? Well, Uline CEO Richard Uihlein and Elizabeth Uihlein, president of Uline Corp., have substantial investments in the Town of Manitowish Waters through EAU Holdings, including a lodge, spa and coffee shop, among other matters. To be sure, Manitowish Waters and Minocqua are not interchangeable. They are 24 miles apart on U.S. 51 and Manitowish Waters is in Vilas County, while Minocqua is in Oneida County. A check of the Oneida County property records, where Minocqua is located, turns up zero hits in its database for either Uihlein or EAU Holdings. In Vilas County, the property database shows three parcel listings for Richard E. and Elizabeth A. Uihlein, as well as 13 parcel listings for EAU Real Estate LLC. A spokesman for the Uihleins declined to comment. Asked about the campaign’s basis to claim the couple are Wisconsin residents, Nicholson spokesman Brandon Moody said in a April 24, 2018, email: "they have a residence in Minocqua. They spend a great deal of time there and they are massive job creators in Wisconsin." Moody went on to refer to dual residencies. "Many donors have multiple addresses. Some live in Florida half the year. That type of thing. This is pretty standard operating procedure," Moody said. Our rating Nicholson released a list of Wisconsin supporters that included "Dick and Liz Uihlein (Minocqua)." The Uihleins are major business owners in Pleasant Prairie and own property in Manitowish Waters. But Richard E. Uihlein is frequently referred to in the media as an Illinois businessman and he is a registered voter of Illinois. So is his wife, Elizabeth A. Uihlein. We rate Nicholson’s claim False.

pomt-07339	"Two-thirds of Wisconsin corporations don't pay state income taxes."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/11/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-two-thirds-wisconsin-corpor/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s push for major cuts in education funding and state employee compensation rests on his claim of a fiscal emergency he traces mainly to government overspending. But Democrats and liberal groups say skewed tax policies favoring the wealthy and business at the expense of the middle class are big factors in the state’s budget shortfalls. Efforts to make that case have often centered on this phrase: "Two-thirds of Wisconsin corporations don't pay state income taxes." The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now -- through its affiliated research arm, Institute for One Wisconsin -- has been part of the effort to get that phrase before the public. The institute’s April report, "We’re Not Broke," called that two-thirds number "shocking," arguing it was evidence that businesses here don’t pay their fair share because of tax loopholes, credits and Wisconsin’s below-average corporate tax rates. With Walker advocating repealing the corporate income tax altogether, we thought it was time to get to the bottom of this claim. When asked to back up the claim, Scot Ross, executive director of both One Wisconsin groups, pointed to a 2011 Department of Revenue report and an analysis of corporate taxation by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Both use 2007 data, which state officials say was the latest and best available as of early 2011. A quick word about the numbers: The universe we are dealing with is corporate income taxes paid by regular "C" corporations at the 7.9% corporate rate -- one of the largest sources of state tax revenue. The Revenue Department study intentionally excludes "S" corporations and limited liability companies that pass through income to multiple owners or partners. They are taxed at lower rates under the personal income tax system, rather than corporate. Officials at both agencies report this: Of 52,497 corporate returns, 17,564 had a tax liability totaling almost $703 million. By our math, that’s 66.5 percent of the corporations with no liability -- the two-thirds in the claim. We wondered if this was a one-year spike. It’s not. Revenue Department officials ran a special report for us. It showed the same 66% figure with little variation in 2004, ’05, ’06 and ’07. They threw in a bonus year, 2008 -- and the share of corporations that didn’t have any tax liability jumped to 69 percent in that year. (The 2008 data was not available when the Institute for One Wisconsin did its report). In fact, the two-thirds mirrors things at the federal level. The Government Accountability Office reported that at least 60 percent of all U.S. companies -- including many small ones -- reported no federal income-tax liability from 1998 to 2005, according to a Wall Street Journal article from 2008. How can it be that at least two out of three corporations pay no tax? Part of the answer lies in the same Revenue Department table. Very close to two-thirds of those 52,497 Wisconsin corporate filers reported zero net income or a net loss in 2007 -- leaving them with no tax liability. "Just because some corporations are large and profitable, it does not follow all corporations are large and profitable," said John Koskinen, chief economist in the state Department of Revenue. "Most corporations are very small with little or no profit." The president of Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization, put it this way: "It’s worth stating the obvious -- if a company is making no money after expenses, it will not pay taxes," said Todd Berry. "Depreciation is such an expense (deduction) -- and one that is generally accepted." Additionally, some companies are inactive in a given year, noted Stephanie Marquis, spokeswoman for the state Department of Revenue. A significant number of individuals -- as opposed to corporations -- also do not have a tax liability. Some 31% did not owe income taxes, according to a 2009 revenue department figures. But that understates the number who didn’t owe taxes, possibly by a large amount, because households with low incomes do not have to file, according to our calculations based on census data. We asked Ross, among those who have cited the number, why he called it "shocking" that firms with no net income would not pay taxes. Ross pointed to the multitude of tax credits and deductions. When used, they can take a profitable firm and reduce its bottom line to zero for tax purposes. The state revenue report confirms the phenomena: A small number of corporations had net income, but still didn’t owe any state income taxes. In total, 390 profitable firms that paid no state income tax claimed enough in tax credits that reduced their tax liability to zero, the Revenue Department report notes. So that means tax credits allowed 2% of firms with net income to avoid taxes. But that’s just a slice of how many firms got tax preferences to reduce their corporate income taxes. In addition to the dozen or more tax credits for corporations, state records list more than 20 other breaks in the form of deductions, exclusions and special treatment, a state report shows. The total tax break for all the preferences was more than $254 million in 2008, according to that Revenue Department report. So it’s clear that tax breaks can have a big impact on corporate tax collections, which in Wisconsin rate in the middle of the pack or lower nationally, a Journal Sentinel investigation found in 2010. Proponents of business tax breaks say it’s important to give incentives for business expansion and improvement. Critics say their pro-business impact is unclear. Despite the controversy over the whole issue, no comprehensive study exists to quantify why firms report no net income. State officials say that would require an individual review of tens of thousands of tax returns. Finally, it’s worth noting two developments that limit the usefulness of the state’s data in drawing conclusions about the business tax climate. No. 1: It’s common now for start-up businesses to form as partnerships instead of "C" corporations. So part the picture is missing, because the state does not pull out tax-payment data on these firms, many of which are small. State revenue officials still say their data on "C" corporations is worthwhile, given the large dollars at stake. No. 2: A relatively new change called "combined reporting" could increase corporate tax revenue collections in the years ahead. No data is yet available on that, however. What’s the bottom line? The liberal Institute for One Wisconsin used state data to assert that two-thirds of Wisconsin corporations pay no state income taxes. The two-thirds number is solid, the trend is long-term and it is reflected by federal tax data as well. For some corporations, tax breaks reduce the bottom line to zero in tax liability. But the group failed to note that some share of those non-paying businesses simply don’t make enough to pay taxes. We can’t say how significant that detail is because the data doesn’t exist. On the Truth-O-Meter that rates as Mostly True.	None	One Wisconsin Now	None	None	None	2011-05-11T09:00:00	2011-04-18	['Wisconsin']

pomt-08527	"More lives have been lost because of the war with the drug cartels in Juarez alone, just a few blocks from the United States of America, than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/05/greg-abbott/attorney-general-greg-abbott-says-more-people-have/	Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has squared off with the federal government on several fronts: the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases threaten the environment, the new health care law and border security. On a July 16 broadcast of Fox New's "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren," Abbott emphasized the gravity of violence on the Texas-Mexico border. "Look at the raw numbers," he said. "More lives have been lost because of the war with the drug cartels in Juarez alone, just a few blocks from the United States of America, than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan. Over the past couple of years, more than 2,400 people in Juarez alone have been killed because of the drug cartel war, more than 5,000 across the country of Mexico. It is more dangerous to walk the streets of Juarez a few blocks from El Paso than it is to walk the streets of Baghdad." Drug violence surged in Mexico in 2008, when the death toll doubled that of 2007, according to a January 2009 CNN story. A September 2008 memo from the U.S. Consulate General in Juarez warns Americans from traveling in Chiuahua due to "an increase in violent criminal activity fueled by a war between drug cartels." First we wondered whether Baghdad is really safer than Juarez, but one security expert suggested that would be a subjective call. The death toll is one indicator of how dangerous a city is, but there are other variables, said Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company. "Safe for whom and safe from what?" he asked. For now, we decided to focus on whether more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in Juarez than in the war in Afghanistan. Regarding the death toll in Juarez, Jerry Strickland, Abbott's spokesman, sent us links to three news stories and two government websites enumerating those killed in the border city across from El Paso. A Feb. 1 crime and safety report on Juarez posted on the federal Overseas Security Advisory Council website says that "although Mexican media and government sources offer varying crime statistics, most sources report at least 2,640 murders committed in and around the city in 2009, up from 1,600 in 2008 and 300 in 2007 ... Violent crime is part of everyday life in Ciudad Juarez. However, the surge in homicides has mostly involved fighting between cartels and street gangs, or between cartels and security forces. Victims without direct involvement in organized crime represent only a small percentage of overall homicides." From a July 13 Reuters story: "The daily killings have become so normal they have almost ceased to shock. Unless Mexico's Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, bucks all previous indicators and undergoes a dramatic security turnaround, the death toll from the drug war raging in the city since January 2008 will reach 6,000 people this month. That is more than all the dead serving in the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan." And McClatchy, citing the Diario newspaper in Juarez, reported in June that between January and June 27, the death toll rose to 1,363, up from 871 during that same period in 2009, and 520 in 2008. Relying on that information, Strickland told us that more than 5,733 people have been killed since January 2008. Stewart, at Stratfor, had slightly different numbers: 4,677 deaths in Juarez from January 2009 through August 2010. So, it seems that since January 2008, at least 3,000 to 5,000 people at least have been killed in Juarez. Since deaths unrelated to drug violence were nominal, according to the Overseas Security Advisory Council, Abbott's figure on Fox — at least 2,400 killed in Juarez in connection with the cartels — sounds conservative. What about Afghanistan? Strickland pointed us to military death tolls for 2008-10 on CNN.com, which has mapped U.S. coalition casualties in Afghanistan by age, location and date. During 2008 and 2009, 808 were killed in Afghanistan, according to the site. As of Oct. 4, 542 people had been killed in 2010. However, Strickland said 239 were killed as of June 1, bringing total military deaths to about 1,50 troops when he made his claim on Fox in July. Including civilian casualties tracked by the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, we found that 5,880 were killed in Afghanistan between 2008-10 — keeping in mind that our tally includes deaths that happened after Abbott made his statement. Abbott calculated 5,475 total casualties during the same time period. But the war in Afghanistan has lasted much longer than three years — the United States invaded in October 2001. When we asked Abbott's office why he limited the number killed in Afghanistan from 2008 to date, Strickland said it was an "apples to apples comparison in terms of time frame." That might be so, but Abbott flatly told Van Susteren that more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in Juarez than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan. Just because the violence in Mexico surged in the past couple years isn't reason to disregard those killed in Afghanistan prior to 2008. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, as of Sept. 27, 1,291 Americans had been killed as a result of the war in Afghanistan, including two civilian casualties, and 94 who were killed outside of Afghanistan. According to the CNN page that Strickland cites, 2,115 U.S. troops and coalition forces have been killed since 2001 (11 were killed that year). Stewart suggested we check iCasualties.org, a website that tracks military casualties, for a fuller picture of total deaths in Afghanistan: that tally was 2,128 when we looked at the site Oct. 4. Next, we looked at United Nations' data for civilian casualties since 2007, the earliest record we found. About 1,520 civilians died that year — about 6,050 since 2007. So even with limited information on how many civilians have been killed in Afghanistan, it seems at least 8,000 people have died as a result of the war since 2001. Where does that leave us? By Abbott's calculation, cobbled from various news and government reports, 258 more people were killed in Juarez than in Afghanistan between 2008 and this past summer, when Abbott appeared on Fox. But that's not what he said. He said more people have died as result of the drug war in Juarez, dating a couple years back, than have died as a result of the war in Afghanistan. That war started in 2001, and far as we can tell, more people have died from it. We rate Abbott's statement False.

pomt-06084	Says taking millionaires off food stamps and unemployment would save $20 million.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/06/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-getting-millionaires-food-stamps-un/	Clarification, 1:44 p.m., Jan. 18, 2012: This fact check correctly says millionaires don’t qualify for food stamps because households with net income above the poverty level are not eligible. Still, as a reader reminded us, someone with paper assets of $1 million or more – such as valuable property – could qualify for food stamps so long as net income is below the poverty level. We’ve added this wrinkle to the story. It does not change our rating. As plans to extend a nationwide payroll tax cut worked their way through Congress, Texas’ senior senator fielded a question Dec. 12, 2011, on CNN about how the government could make up for lost revenues -- perhaps $180 billion to $200 billion over ten years. One proposal that Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison gave: "We’re going to take millionaires off food stamps and unemployment insurance which, amazingly, would save $20 million." Although Congress passed a two-month extension of payroll tax cuts Dec. 23, 2011, the House proposal to extend the cuts for a year awaits consideration -- and it contains the "millionaire" modifications. The cuts reduce from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent the amount of eligible earnings taken from Americans’ paychecks to help pay for Social Security. We wondered if Hutchison was right that taking millionaires off food stamps and unemployment insurance would save $20 million. We realized, for starters, that millionaires already don’t qualify for food stamps. PolitiFact reported in a related fact-check Dec. 1, 2011, that the food stamp program, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is only open to households where net income is below the federal poverty level -- this year, $1,863 a month for a household of four. One wrinkle: It’s possible that a household with paper assets of $1 million or more could still qualify, still only if its net income is sufficiently low. By email, U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Aaron Lavallee told us that the department knows of "only one case and one alleged case involving individuals with assets over $1 million" getting SNAP benefits. Lavallee said the confirmed case -- a Michigan man who made headlines in May 2011 for using food stamps despite winning $2 million in a lottery -- was removed from the program and the second case is being investigated. Mindful there’s no savings in barring millionaires from food stamps, we wondered next how many millionaires collect unemployment insurance. Annual counts of millionaires on unemployment, based on IRS data, appeared in an Oct. 1, 2010, Bloomberg news story and a Nov. 13, 2011, report by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma: 2009: $20.8 million collected by 2,362 millionaires 2008: $18.6 million collected by 2,840 millionaires 2007: $13 million collected by 2,182 millionaires 2006: $12 million collected by 1,972 millionaires 2005: $9.5 million collected by 1,647 millionaires The Bloomberg article also tells why millionaires can collect: As insurance, rather than welfare, benefits aren’t paid out according to need but according to whether a person has become unemployed. There’s no income test. And how did Hutchison reach her savings figure? Her spokesman Jeff Nelligan sent us a House Ways and Means Committee breakdown of the House’s payroll tax cut proposal, and directed us to the section describing how it would target millionaires by requiring them to pay a 100-percent tax rate on any received unemployment benefits. That is, any benefits received would have to be paid back. The Ways and Means breakdown says that making millionaires pay back their unemployment benefits would reduce the federal deficit by $20 million over 2012-2021. Citing Congress’ bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the breakdown says that all told, the government would save $127 million in unemployment benefits that it would not have to pay, but lose $107 million in revenue due to fewer millionaires collecting benefits -- partly because some (or all) millionaires won’t apply for unemployment if the provision passes into law. These figures also appeared in a Dec. 9, 2011, Congressional Budget Office report. Result: The projected savings -- or more precisely, the 10-year decrease in the federal deficit -- is $20 million. Finally, we wondered why the government would lose $107 million if the anti-millionaire provision becomes law. Jim Billimoria, communications director for the Ways and Means Committee, told us that when the government writes fewer unemployment checks: Federal tax revenues drop, because unemployment insurance is taxable income. State tax revenues drop, because states don’t have to tap their unemployment insurance trust funds as heavily to pay the benefits -- and thus they don’t have to raise state payroll taxes as much as they might have otherwise. We contacted the CBO and JCT seeking the basis of the $107 million estimate. JCT chief of staff Thomas Barthold told us its estimate took into account predicted income growth, changes in income distribution and projected unemployment insurance claims for the 10-year period. Our ruling Hutchison said that getting millionaires off unemployment and food stamps would save the government $20 million -- though she doesn’t acknowledge that millionaires are already barred from the food-stamp program; there’s no new savings possible on that front. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2012-01-06T17:01:27	2011-12-12	['None']

pomt-12666	"In recent years ... the Obama administration was committed to the notion, against all evidence, that we could reset relations with Putin."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/20/devin-nunes/devin-nunes-oversimplifies-timeline-obama-reset-ru/	In his opening statement at a closely watched hearing about possible Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., criticized United States policy toward Russia under President Barack Obama. "In recent years, committee members have issued repeated and forceful pleas for stronger actions against Russian belligerence, but the Obama administration was committed to the notion, against all evidence, that we could reset relations with Putin," Nunes said. This description of the Obama administration’s position struck us as one-sided, so we took a closer look. We asked Nunes's office for comment, but didn't hear back. We concluded it’s misleading for Nunes to have ignored at least three years of the Obama administration in which the reset policy was dead, replaced by a much tougher line on Moscow. How the reset came about In March 2009, about two months after Obama was sworn in, his administration initiated a new policy toward Russia called the "reset." The official kickoff came in Geneva on March 6, 2009, when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a red button. The new policy came less than a year after conflict flared in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two regions of Georgia, an independent country that was previously part of the Soviet Union. Obama’s foreign policy team had decided that the United States had a window of opportunity to find common ground on certain issues with Russia, given that Dmitry Medvedev had replaced Vladimir Putin as president in mid 2008. The administration -- and some outside observers -- credit the reset with some achievements, at least initially. During the period when the reset was U.S. policy, the two nations signed a nuclear-arms treaty; reached an agreement to allow U.S. troops and weapons destined for Afghanistan to be sent through Russian territory rather than Pakistan; collaborated on tough United Nations sanctions against Iran; achieved Russian membership in the World Trade Organization; and agreed that Russia would not use a U.N. Security Council veto to block a bombing campaign in Libya by the United States and its European allies. As time went on, though, the reset drew increasing criticism. In 2011, former chess champion and human-rights activist Garry Kasparov criticized both Obama and Putin, telling the Daily Beast that the reset was "a disaster." And Douglas J. Feith, who served as undersecretary of defense for policy during the George W. Bush administration, co-wrote an article in Foreign Policy that called the reset "a head-shaking disappointment." The reset peters out The era of cooperation began to come apart in 2012 -- not coincidentally, the year Putin returned to the presidency after Medvedev’s term. Large street protests in his 2012 presidential campaign "had unnerved Mr. Putin, and he accused Mrs. Clinton of instigating them," the New York Times reported. "White House officials had hoped the hostile talk was just for domestic campaign purposes, but even after Mr. Putin formally won re-election, he kept it up." Relations worsened further in 2013, when Russia took in Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who had leaked a large trove of sensitive intelligence. The last straw, however, came in 2014 with Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. A popular revolution overthrew pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine, another former Soviet republic that became independent after the end of the Cold War. Russia responded by applying military pressure in pro-Russian regions of Ukraine and eventually annexing Crimea. In addition to strongly condemning Russia’s actions, the United States worked with its European allies to impose a series of escalating sanctions on Moscow starting on March 6, 2014. The sanctions "inflicted real costs on Russia," said Dan Nexon, a Georgetown University foreign service professor. Emma Ashford, a research fellow with expertise on Russia at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that while the reset was "dying" between 2012 and 2014, the sanctions were a turning point. "By 2014, with turmoil in Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Crimea, there was no longer any real attempt to seek the reset," she said. "In fact, the Obama administration pursued a strong sanctions policy against Russia, and contributed troops to bolster NATO forces in Eastern Europe." Other experts agreed. "Certainly by March 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, there was no evidence of any ongoing Obama administration commitment to the reset," added Susan H. Allen, a foreign policy specialist at George Mason University. "The U.S. condemnation of the annexation of Crimea was clear and unequivocal." "By 2014, I don't know how anyone could credibly argue that U.S. policy was the reset policy," added Richard Nephew, a research scholar at Columbia University. Our ruling Nunes said, "In recent years ... the Obama administration was committed to the notion, against all evidence, that we could reset relations with Putin." Nunes’ summary of U.S. policy toward Russia is at best incomplete. The Obama administration did pursue a reset policy, and kept it up arguably as late as 2014. But observers agree that the policy was dead no later than early 2014, when Russia intervened in Ukraine, and was already in question for two years before that. Nunes’ statement is misleadingly oversimplified, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-08841	"There's still about $400 billion or $500 billion of the stimulus plan that has not been spent. Why don't we stop it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/10/john-boehner/rep-john-boehner-proposes-us-stop-stimulus-spendin/	In an NBC Meet the Press interview on Aug. 8, 2010, host David Gregory repeatedly questioned House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, about how Republicans would offset the cost of extending all of the Bush tax cuts, as they have proposed. Boehner said halting stimulus spending would be a good start. "Why don't we stop the stimulus spending?" Boehner said. "There's still about $400 billion or $500 billion of the stimulus plan that has not been spent. Why don't we stop it. It's not working." White House officials disputed Boehner's numbers, as well as Boehner's use of the term "unspent." We checked the latest updated figures on stimulus spending at the government's website recovery.gov. Stimulus programs were divided into three sectors: tax breaks to individuals and businesses; projects such as new roads, bridges and high-speed rail; and payments to state governments for things such as hiring teachers and police officers and for services such as extended unemployment insurance and health coverage. As of Aug. 4, 2010, $223 billion of the promised $288 billion in tax relief had already been paid out, as had $132 billion of the budgeted $275 billion for projects and $140 billion of the $224 billion set aside in the stimulus for entitlements. That comes to $495 billion that has already gone out the door. There was $787 billion in the stimulus, so that leaves only $292 billion that hasn't yet been paid out by the government. So right off the bat, Boehner's $400 billion to $500 billion figure is much too high. Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Republican Leader, said Boehner was talking about spending cuts outlined by Reps. Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling (which Boehner referenced immediately prior in the interview) and "must have transposed the $266 billion figure for the stimulus with the $396 billion total figure for TARP. Honest mistake." Fair enough. That happens in live interviews. But we think it's misleading to refer to even that lower number as "unspent" stimulus, because much of the $292 billion has been obligated, even though it has not been paid out. Let's start with the tax cuts. Most of them are being paid out gradually over a two-year period. For example, the Making Work Pay cuts (a refundable credit of up to $400 per individual and $800 per married couple) show up weekly in workers' paychecks. But it is not officially fully paid out until the program expires. White House officials contend these tax cuts aren't "unspent" because people are expecting to get their tax cuts. The term "unspent" becomes even more suspect when talking about the stimulus projects. Recovery Act awardees don’t pay contractors up front for work on infrastructure projects. They usually make progress payments and withhold final payment until the project is completed. But the money is obligated and under contract. According to Recovery.gov, about 80 percent ($215 billion) of the project funds have been awarded and are under contract and agreement. Most are currently underway. Another $25 billion has been awarded but isn’t under contract yet. And the final $25 billion is in the process of being awarded. So it would be possible to put the brakes on some of the stimulus funding, though it would likely anger folks who have received awards or who are well into the process of applying for awards. But there's not nearly as much unspent -- and that could conceivably be used to offset the expense of extending the Bush tax cuts -- as Boehner suggested. We rate his claim False.

pomt-01282	"We have the third-lowest minimum wage … of developed countries."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/01/david-cicilline/david-cicilline-says-us-has-third-lowest-minimum-w/	During a highly charged -- and pretty entertaining -- debate on Channel 10 last Sunday, incumbent Democrat David Cicilline squared off against Cormick Lynch, the Republican who is challenging him for the 1st Congressional District seat. Lynch kept speaking over Cicilline, Cicilline repeatedly patted Lynch on the arm to quiet him, and moderator Bill Rappleye tried to keep everything under control. ("Please, don’t touch," he said more than once.) One of the issues that divides the candidates is the federal minimum wage. Cicilline is co-sponsor of a bill that would raise it to $10.10 from its current $7.25. Lynch vehemently opposes the move. "Raising the minimum wage is going to further destroy the business environment," Lynch said in the debate. "We need to drive private-sector investment and restore the economy, not legislate solutions to the problem." Cicilline countered that raising the minimum wage would stimulate the economy by giving people more money to spend. "No-one should work full-time in this country … and live in poverty," he said. "We have the third-lowest minimum wage of countries in the OECD, of developed countries." Lynch was hardly convinced. "Congressman, what color was the unicorn you rode in on today?" he said. "What planet did it take you here from?" Mythical creatures and space travel aside, we were interested in Cicilline’s claim about how the U.S. minimum wage stacks up against those in other countries. The "OECD" referred to in Cicilline’s statement is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international group headquartered in Paris that aims to stimulate world trade. It has 34 member countries that range from the highly-developed, such as the United States, Germany and Japan, to the emerging, such as Mexico, Turkey and Chile. The group compiles a range of data on the economies of its member nations. One area of analysis is earnings, which includes minimum wages. When we first looked at the data on minimum wages, we thought Cicilline might be mistaken. The minimum wage in the U.S. measured in real dollars falls in the middle of the pack of 24 countries that supplied numbers to the OECD, according to this table. Australia ranked first with a minimum wage in U.S dollars of $15.20, followed by Luxembourg ($14.30) and France ($12.50). The United States ranked 11th and Mexico came in last at $0.60. But there’s another way of comparing minimum wages that offers more context by accounting for cost-of-living variations from country to country. The OECD compiles another table comparing minimum wages relative to the median wages of full-time workers. "Median rather than mean [average] earnings provide a better basis for international comparisons as it accounts for differences in earnings dispersion across countries," the OECD explains. In the United States, the minimum wage is just 37 percent of the median wage. In a comparison of the 28 countries in the table, the United States ranks 26th, above only the Czech Republic and Mexico. The leading countries in that table are Turkey, where the minimum wage is 69 percent of the median wage, followed by Chile (68 percent) and France (61 percent). In that comparison, the United States is indeed third-lowest. Economists say that this type of comparison creates a benchmark for looking at minimum wages across time periods or countries. It shows the buying power of different minimum wages in different places, they say. On average, the minimum wage in OECD countries has hovered around 50 percent of the median wage, according to this paper from the Hamilton Project. In the United States, it used to be that high but has steadily fallen. (See page 3 of the paper for a good graphic showing this.) Cicilline’s spokeswoman told us that the source of the Congressman’s statement was an Oct. 24 interview on MSNBC with U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez. During the interview, as the screen flashed data from the same table that we found, Perez said that the United States has the third-lowest minimum wage among OECD nations. Our ruling David Cicilline said that the United States has the third-lowest minimum wage among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Although the U.S. minimum wage is not that low in terms of U.S. dollars, it is third-lowest in a more meaningful comparison relative to the median wage. (Here’s a good graphic from the Department of Labor showing how the U.S. stacks up against other developed nations.) We rule Cicilline’s statement True.

pomt-07125	"Creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County has the same impact as 500 jobs in the metro region."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/17/john-kitzhaber/governor-compares-creating-25-jobs-rural-umatilla-/	Jobs, jobs, jobs. If there has been an unofficial theme for the 2011 legislative session -- you know, besides budget cutting -- it would have been job creation. That’s what everything seems to revolve around these days; how do you put the state back to work? Even a recent hearing on the Oregon Youth Authority’s diminished budget turned toward jobs. Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, thanked the subcommittee that had worked on the department’s budget for not cutting certain facilities located in her district. "The loss of those rural jobs would be absolutely devastating," she said. Then she added something that caught our attention: "I keep remembering Gov. Kitzhaber's remarks that 15 jobs in Tillamook is equal to 500 in Portland. By maintaining these facilities -- these are economic drivers, we profoundly thank the committee for keeping them open." The reason this jumped out at us is that we’d actually seen this sort of statistic attributed to the governor before. Back in April, the governor released a noteoutlining some of the successes of his first 100 days in office. One of them read like this: "I traveled to Pendleton and Ontario to launch a new solar array and visit Oregon companies like Hill Meat Company. Creating 25 jobs in Umatilla County has the same impact as 500 jobs in the Portland metro region." We’d actually started to fact check it back then, but got distracted. Sen. Johnson’s comment was just what we needed to get us back on track. Back when the governor sent his note out, we asked Amy Wojcicki, his spokeswoman, to explain exactly what the governor meant. She got back to us with a cheat-sheet of the staff’s math and told us there had been a slight mistake. Turns out, she said, 25 jobs in Umatilla was more like 780 jobs in the Portland area. Their math, as Wojcicki explained it, went like this: Using state employment statistics from January 2011, the Portland metro area had an overall employment level of 1,067,037 while Umatilla had one of 34,261. "The quickest and least complicated way to demonstrate equivalency is a simple ratio," she wrote. So the team took 25 and divided it by 34,261 to get an idea of what 25 jobs was relative to the overall employment number in Umatilla. They took the result of that equation and multiplied it by the Portland-area employment level to get an idea of how many jobs would be needed to have a similar impact there. The answer: 779 jobs. "Adding 25 jobs in Umatilla county was therefore equivalent to adding 779 jobs in PDX in January," Wojcicki concluded. The math seemed sound to us, but we’re not employment experts, so we got in touch with Dallas Fridley, a regional economist for the Oregon Employment Department located in Hood River. He walked us through the state’s employment recordsand we did a few of our own calculations based on the overall employment data from 2010. According to our stats, 25 jobs in Umatilla was more like 750 in Portland, but the governor’s point was still right on. If anything he had originally underestimated the impact. (For those of you wondering, the impact of 25 jobs in Tillamook is comparable to some 2,230 in the Portland-area under this method.) Still, something was nagging at us. Sure, 25 jobs in Umatilla would have the same impact in terms of employment statistics as 700-some jobs in the Portland area, but would it have "the same impact" overall? We wondered what Fridley thought. He was of two minds about the issue. "At the end of the day we are talking about equivalents here," he said. "I think there actually is an argument that the net is only 25 jobs ... at the end of the day it's not 750 jobs. "While it is technically true that, proportionally it works out this way, it's still not an increase of 750 jobs." If you’re looking at the state as a whole, he said, there’s really no question that it would be better to have 750 jobs rather than 25 -- those 750 would go much further toward lowering the overall employment rate. "Growth in Portland or growth anywhere in the state does often benefit the entire state." But, Fridley added, for rural communities, it’s important to consider the relative local impact, as well. "For the most part, job opportunities are harder to come by in rural communities. … In some ways, (25 jobs in a rural community) is a bigger deal, simply because the rural areas don't grow as quickly." Ultimately when you’re making these sorts of comparisons, he said, "you don't really have a lot of options." What’s that joke about economists loving the phrase "on the one hand ... and on the other … "? We decided to get one more opinion on the issue and phoned up Tom Potiowsky, the state economist. We asked him what he thought about the governor’s Umatilla-Portland comparison. Obviously, from a statewide perspective, 750 jobs will always be more advantageous than 25, Potiowsky said. But, if you’re comparing the way one defined area would be impacted by receiving a certain number of jobs to the way another defined area would be impacted, then the approach is the right one. "When you start thinking about other geographic areas, then, I think that comparison makes sense," he said. "In those localities, they have a much smaller labor force, and so a much smaller number of jobs increase." That makes sense to us. Once it’s clear the governor is talking about local impact, his statistics hold up -- they’re even understated. But, without that clarity you might hear that statement and think that 25 jobs in Umatilla had the same impact for the state as a whole as 750 in Portland, which just isn’t the case. So, we’ll give the governor a Mostly True here -- the statement is accurate but needs some clarification. Comment on this item.

pomt-03805	On support of Gov. John Kasich’s drilling tax plan	full flop	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/25/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-shifts-pos/	A signature part of Gov. John Kasich's budget proposal is the reduction in the state's income tax that he has long promised. To help pay for it, Kasich proposes to increase severance taxes on oil and gas drillers. The proposed changes target larger drilling companies and are meant to allow Ohio to share in the wealth from horizontal drilling in the Utica Shale formation. Kasich first proposed the plan in 2012. GOP legislative leaders refused to consider raising taxes on the oil and gas industry, however, which led Kasich to say Republican lawmakers had been influenced by "special interests" -- meaning the lobbies associated with the oil and gas industry. That was one year ago. At that time, Mike Dittoe, a spokesman for House Speaker William G. Batchelder, said that removing the tax plan from Kasich's midterm budget review did not mean the issue was rejected or dead. Dittoe said GOP members of the House only wanted more time to study the issue. By last December -- when Kasich held his annual year-end review at the Statehouse, with Batchelder seated beside him -- it appeared that the issue was near resolution. Though Batchelder's chamber had refused to take up the tax proposal in 2012, the Medina Republican predicted it would win approval this year. "I don’t think there’s any question we ultimately will support it," he said. Then came this month’s three-day winter meeting of the powerful Ohio Oil and Gas Association, where Batchelder spoke out against Kasich’s tax plan and called it "nonsense." "Let me just say to you," the Coshocton Tribune reported him saying, "that, as long as I’m there, we’re not going to be doing the kinds of things to damage an industry that are among the proposals that have been made." Batchelder confirmed to the newspaper after the event ended that he will not support Kasich’s tax plan, calling it "a big mistake," and saying lawmakers would have to find another way to achieve Kasich’s stated goal of slashing income taxes for small-business owners by 50 percent and for all individuals by 20 percent. "I don’t know that that’s the only thing that can lead to an income tax cut," he said. Had Batchelder's position changed? What was it? PolitiFact Ohio asked Mike Dittoe. "No, the Speaker’s stance has not changed on the issue of the severance tax," the spokesman responded in an email similar to one reported in the publication Columbus Business First. "Speaker Batchelder has voiced his reservations about the severance tax for months, dating back to 2011 and 2012 … He has always maintained a commitment publicly and privately to Gov. Kasich to closely examine the severance tax and all other proposed tax reform issues contained within the state budget and beyond. "When the Speaker indicated the severance tax would be accomplished in December," Dittoe continued, "he said that in the context, as he has previously, of an overall conversation about tax reform in Ohio. Since early February, the Speaker and members of the House have had some time to review the proposed severance tax language as provided by the Governor – the majority caucus still has reservations on this proposed language … "The Speaker has always maintained that the targeting one specific industry for tax revenue is problematic and he wants to work with the business community in the hopes that they will coalesce around an overall tax reform proposal, which would be far more acceptable. The Speaker made a commitment to work with the Governor to accomplish a severance tax proposal last year, but still has concerns on this severance tax language proposed." Dittoe also noted that "we are very early in the ball game" -- meaning less than three months into a two-year General Assembly -- and "final determinations on any component of the budget have not yet been made." Batchelder "never set a timetable to accomplish the severance tax issue, only voiced concerns about the proposal before us," Dittoe said. "It is certainly possible that other proposed language will be something that the legislature will agree upon in the near future, inside or outside of the budget." PolitiFact agrees it is still early in the 130th General Assembly. Proposals will change, positions will be modified and alliances will shift. The effect of Batchelder’s position on Kasich’s oil and gas tax may not have changed over the past year, but his tone and words about it have shifted several times. He may have the matter under judicious consideration, as Dittoe indicated, but the direction in which he is leaning and his level of certainty have changed significantly with his audience and circumstances. We call that a Full Flop.	None	William G. Batchelder	None	None	None	2013-03-25T06:00:00	2013-03-17	['John_Kasich']

pomt-00607	"For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/02/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-first-time-35-years-we-have-more-/	At the economic summit for Republican presidential candidates convened by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States. "For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting," Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event. Is that correct? We took a closer look. We located a May 2014 report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, "Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros." In that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubio’s claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics. "Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time," they wrote. They found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. "The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing," the authors wrote. Here’s the kicker from the report: "Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data," the authors wrote. Here’s a graph showing the trend line: Technically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so it’s not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasn’t twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubio’s claim is accurate. "It’s true," Litan told PolitiFact, adding, "We haven’t reversed this yet." As for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, "it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones." Our ruling Rubio said that "for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting." The change didn’t happen in the past year or two -- it occurred in 2008 -- but in general, Rubio has accurately cited a statistic from a respected think tank’s report. The co-author of that report said he feels Rubio has stated the claim accurately. We rate Rubio’s claim True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-06-02T13:37:13	2015-06-02	['None']
pomt-08134	Says the military accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's economy.	true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/07/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-military-makes-nearly-10-percent-f/	Gov.-elect Rick Scott kicked off a five-day, 10-city tour of the state's major industries on Dec. 6, 2010, by meeting with defense contractors and Florida-based military leaders. Scott started the tour in the Panhandle, meeting with about 20 defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, L-3 Communications and InDyne Corp., at the University of Florida Research and Engineering Education Facility in Shalimar, before meeting with military leaders at Eglin Air Force Base. "We want to make sure we're always thought of as a very military-friendly state," Scott said to reporters at a brief press conference. "We're going to focus on what our strengths are. We're clearly a logical place for the military to expand and for the defense industry to expand. We've got a lot of talent in the state, we like the defense industry and the military, so we're going to figure out where we have the most value." Scott tried to underscore the importance of the military to Florida by noting that the military accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's economy, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Florida is home to 20 major military installations and three unified combatant commands. The Gulf of Mexico is a key training ground for both the Air Force and the Navy, and the state also has two U.S. Coast Guard air stations and another dozen other Coast Guard stations. But does all of that translate to a 10 percent share of the state's gross domestic product, which was $737 billion in 2009? The answer comes from an arm of Enterprise Florida called the Florida Defense Alliance, a public/private partnership created in 1998 to help position Florida to keep its military infrastructure in place and expand in other areas when opportunities arise. The group commissioned a study in 2008 to examine the economic impact of Florida's stationed military and auxiliary defense industry work. The study was conducted by Rick Harper, an economist from the University of West Florida, who has studied the economic impact of the film and entertainment industry in Florida and who represented Northwest Florida on former Gov. Jeb Bush's Council of Economic Advisers from 2001-2006. Using 2005 data, Harper concluded that defense-related spending is responsible for $52 billion, or 7.5 percent, of Florida's gross state product that year. The military spent $27 billion across Florida counties in fiscal year 2005, Harper concluded -- $10.4 billion was for goods and services, $12.4 billion for pensions and transfer payments, and $4.3 billion for salaries and wages. The rest of the economic impact is measured in indirect and induced spending, which would include parts of the private defense industry as well as parts of the Florida economy that help service the military, the defense industry and their employees. Harper said that defense and military spending accounted for 732,300 direct and indirect jobs in the state and generated state and local tax revenues of nearly $1 billion. Counties with larger installations enjoy larger impacts, Harper found. Military and defense spending in Duval County had a $12.1 billion impact, a $5.3 billion impact in Hillsborough County and a $6.6 billion impact in Okaloosa County. All but six counties have at least $3 million per year in direct defense-related spending. Harper and Florida Defense Alliance executive director Rocky McPherson noted that the study does not include the economic impact generated by the Florida National Guard or Coast Guard operations. You can see a short synopsis of the study for yourself here. Or if you have a lot of time, here's the three-volume version. Harper's study relies on five-year-old data, so we wanted to see if there was anything more recent. McPherson said Harper and University of West Florida researchers were updating their study using 2008 data but, he said, that report is not available yet. Harper declined to share the results of the study with PolitiFact Florida, but did talk about the results in general terms. Since 2005, Department of Defense "spending has risen substantially, particularly in terms of procurement (i.e., contracting), as well as payments to disabled veterans, although active duty military staffing numbers (number of people) have declined somewhat and payments to retirees are not growing as they did earlier due to attrition of WWII and Korean era veterans," Harper wrote. "The overall growth in military spending (the study to be released uses 2008 federal spending data), combined with weakness in other areas of the Florida economy in the most recent years, means that DoD (Department of Defense) spending will have risen as a share of the total economy." We searched around for other studies measuring the military's economic impact in Florida, but found none. In examining Harper's study, we found it to be a straightforward, unbiased report. Researchers relied on Department of Defense actual expenditures, precise personnel levels and actual government contracts. Where does it leave us? Scott told reporters military spending makes up about 10 percent of the state's economy. In 2005, military spending accounted for 7.5 percent of the state gross domestic product, but that figure did not include the impact of the Florida National Guard or Coast Guard bases. The author of the study, who is now updating his report using 2008 numbers, said that while he cannot release more up-to-date numbers, that the military's position in the economy has risen since 2005. That will make Scott's point nearly right on. We rate this claim True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2010-12-07T18:40:12	2010-12-06	['None']

pomt-09360	''Both Democrats and Republicans are advocating for the use of student test scores to measure teacher effectiveness.''	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/02/foundation-floridas-future/foundation-floridas-future-claims-theres-bipartisa/	The Foundation for Florida's Future, founded and chaired by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, says both Democrats and Republicans are advocating the use of student test scores to measure teachers' effectiveness. The group issued the claim in a bid to refute the notion that reform is "a purely partisan effort" at a time when an education bill making its way through the Florida Legislature is causing a political firestorm. It has grown so heated that the sergeants-at-arms had to form a barrier between angry educators and lawmakers at the end of a March 25, 2010, hearing of the House Pre-K-12 Policy Committee. The foundation made the claim in an e-mail sent to Florida political editors on March 26, 2010, entitled ''Myth vs. Fact: The Truth About Reform [Round Two] Modernizing Teacher Evaluations, Tenure and Compensation for the 21st Century.'' It goes on to say that reform advocates include President Barack Obama, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and cites Florida's business community as calling on the Florida Legislature to act on these issues. The e-mail contains many interesting facts, but we decided to focus on whether former Gov. Bush's own state – clearly a focus of the foundation's e-mail – is the bipartisan paradise his organization describes. On March 24, the Senate voted 21-17 to approve a bill (SB 6) that included language that would link teacher pay raises to student standardized tests rather than years of service. The legislation includes creation of a ''Performance Fund for Instructional Personnel and School-Based Administrators.'' The Associated Press reported that the bill passed "the Republican-controlled Senate on largely party-line vote," over the opposition of "the Florida Education Association," the statewide teachers union, which AP described as "an important Democratic constituency group." In the Senate roll call vote, four GOP senators broke with the party and voted against it. So did every single Democrat who voted on the measure. One of those who voted against it was Paula Dockery, the Lakeland Republican who is challenging Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum for their party's gubernatorial nomination. Two lawmakers – Sen. Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, and Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston – did not vote. The House version of the Senate bill (HB 7189) is pending a vote in the full House the week of April 5. It was approved by the House PreK-12 Policy Committee, 9-6, on March 25. Every Democrat voted against it along with one Republican, Mike Weinstein, R-Orange Park. Some opponents call it a union-busting bill. Other critics say linking teacher pay to pupils' performance on standardized tests would pile on more tests in an already test-preoccupied state. Moreover, parent-teacher groups opposing the measure – and urging the House to vote it down – are pushing for defeat of the legislation sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher, a Republican and chairman of the state Republican party. Even former Gov. Bush on March 25, 2010 – the morning after the Florida Senate passed the bill – acknowledged a Republican-Democratic divide in talking about education reform efforts on the MSNBC cable network program Morning Joe. "I think Secretary Duncan and President Obama deserve credit for a) challenging a really powerful core constituency in their own party but b), more importantly, putting students first rather than the adults in the system," he said. "And so there's all sorts of common ground now that is very exciting. And I think that is perhaps one of the reasons why there's a lot of new energy around this. But charter schools in places that historically haven’t had them, a stronger form of accountability, a real focus on children that lag behind, has yielded incredible results in places like Florida … " President Obama and Duncan may be advocating some education reforms. But in response to a reporter's question on March 10, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs seemed to draw a distinction between ''merit pay'' and ''performance pay.'' Here's part of the March 10 exchange: Q: So he does support merit pay increase for performance. MR. GIBBS: He supports the pay for performance, and I think a grand expansion of those ideas across a number of school districts was one of the many things – including early childhood education, changes in data and innovation -- that I think lay out the strong foundation for an educational reform agenda that the President believes will ultimately lead to increased economic growth. Moreover, Obama acknowledged the partisan rancor himself in a March 10, 2009, speech to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on a Complete and Competitive American Education: "For decades, Washington has been trapped in the same debates that have paralyzed progress and perpetuated our educational decline. Too many supporters of my party have resisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know it can make a difference in the classroom. "...I think you'd all agree that the time for finger-pointing is over. The time for holding us – holding ourselves – accountable is here. What's required is not simply new investments, but new reforms. It's time to expect more from our students. It's time to start rewarding good teachers, stop making excuses for bad ones." Patricia Levesque of the Foundation for Florida's Future says the "Myth vs Fact" claim intentionally focused on the federal landscape, which is more favorable to the notion of rewarding teachers for accomplishment in the classroom. Asked why Florida Democrats don't follow what she sees as a national trend, she replied: "That's the million-dollar question. It really is federally and in other states a bipartisan issue." It is true that President Obama and Education Secretary Duncan support performance pay for teachers, which is among the key provisions in SB 6. But in Florida, where the foundation also focuses its claim, the Democrats are on the other side of this very contentious debate. So we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11381	Says Supreme Court rival Michael Screnock "is running with the Koch brothers support."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/29/rebecca-dallet/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-rebecca-dallet-s/	The involvement of conservative industrialists David and Charles Koch in Wisconsin politics is no secret. In early March 2018, Concerned Veterans for America -- a group underwritten by the billionaire brothers -- said it planned to spend $1.6 million to air two ads attacking Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin over past problems at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In 2017, Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin, a conservative group backed by the Kochs, launched what it labeled a "seven-figure" TV ad buy against Baldwin, up for re-election in 2018. Now, state Supreme Court candidate Rebecca Dallet, a Milwaukee County Circuit judge, claims the Koch brothers are backing her opponent, Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock. In what is officially a nonpartisan race that will be decided by voters April 3, 2018, Screnock is backed by conservative groups, while liberal groups are supporting Dallet. Dallet made the claim during a Feb. 2, 2018, interview on UpFront with Mike Gousha on WISN-TV, saying Screnock "is running with the hashtag Wisconsin right. He is running with the Koch brothers support, with the Walker machine support." Of those three elements, the most politically inflammatory one is the Koch brothers -- often used by the left to tag someone as out of step with voters. Is Dallet right about the Koch connection? The claim When asked to provide backup for the claim, the Dallet campaign pointed to a Jan. 23, 2018, Associated Press article in the Chicago Tribune, which described two Screnock campaign advisers as having "deeply partisan" backgrounds: Sean Lansing is a former Republican operative who also previously worked for the Koch brothers group Americans for Prosperity in both Wisconsin and Virginia. And Luke Hilgemann is the former state director of Americans for Prosperity in Wisconsin and CEO of Americans for Prosperity nationwide. Hilgemann and Lansing recently purchased the Champion Group LLC, a political consulting group, from Keith Gilkes, a longtime adviser to Gov. Scott Walker. "Big-money special interests have spent over $1.3 million to try and buy a loyal Justice on Wisconsin's Supreme Court," said Dallet campaign manager Jessica Lovejoy. "And Judge Screnock's team is full of Koch brothers operatives who boast resumes full of shady Koch brothers organizations." But that wasn’t Dallet’s claim. Lansing noted he and Hilgemann once worked for Americans for Prosperity, but said "we no longer have any affiliation with the organization." Indeed, in the campaign world, it is not unusual for operatives to move between campaigns and interest groups. So, that alone is not enough to back the claim. Indeed, there is no evidence of the most direct form of support from either of the Koch brothers -- a campaign contribution or endorsement. Looking further Of course, there are other ways to "support" a campaign or candidate, such as running TV or radio ads in support of a candidate, or in opposition to an opponent. Does any of that apply here? Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, argued that Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin is essentially "the field operation for turning out Republican voters in elections. They have a long track record of doing this and are not shy about advertising it." He cited a series of tweets the group sent that noted its get-out-the-vote efforts for the February 2018 primary -- a contest in which the Supreme Court race was the only statewide one on the ballot. On Feb. 17, 2018, the group tweeted: "The Spring Primary election is only THREE days away and our activists in Racine are working hard to get out the vote before Tuesday!" The same day it tweeted: "Our Green Bay office is ready for our Get out the Vote #DayofAction today! Make sure you make a plan + head to the polls on Feb. 20th!" Efforts to reach Eric Bott, director of the Wisconsin branch of Americans for Prosperity via telephone and email, were unsuccessful. The get-out-the-vote effort represents support in a broad sense, in that the Koch-backed group wanted to get conservative voters to the polls, which would have benefited Screnock. Is there anything more concrete? The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit organization that tracks money in Wisconsin state politics and advocates for campaign finance reform, said as of March 27, 2018, the two candidates combined had raised more than $1.2 million since the beginning of the year. Campaign finance reports filed by the candidates show the state GOP and longtime Republican donors backing Screnock, while unions and traditional Democratic contributors supported Dallet. The Democracy Campaign reported that Screnock’s latest reports showed his two largest contributors as the Republican Party of Wisconsin (about $293,450) and Diane Hendricks of Beloit, chairwoman of ABC Supply ($20,000). Dallet’s latest campaign reports showed her two largest contributors were the Wisconsin Education Association Council political action committee ($18,000) and Madison Teachers Inc. PAC ($18,000). Meanwhile, the Democracy Campaign also reported that during the race, a group called the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform purchased about $63,600 in advertising on Milwaukee and La Crosse television and radio stations during the last two weeks before the Feb. 20, 2018, primary. The primary race featured Dallet, Screnock and Madison lawyer Tim Burns. The Democracy Campaign says the group has used a Madison post office box and a Milwaukee phone number as its only contact information: The Alliance’s website was initially registered by Lorri Pickens, a former director at Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch to spend money on Republican and conservative candidates for state and federal offices around the country. So, that provides some additional evidence, albeit several steps removed from the Koch brothers themselves. Our rating Dallet says her Supreme Court rival Michael Screnock "is running with the Koch brothers support." But while Screnock’s views would clearly match more closely with theirs than the views of Dallet, there is no evidence the billionaire brothers have given money directly to Screnock’s campaign or made statements supportive of it. The primary group they support -- Americans for Prosperity, a group that backs Republicans -- has been active in the race, through get out the vote efforts, not ad buys. In addition, another group that may be tied to the Koch brothers did some ad buys in the primary. We rate Dallet’s claim Half True.

pomt-11997	Florida’s coastal and stormwater infrastructure are "two of the most critical areas during a storm, and received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016."	true	/florida/statements/2017/sep/25/gwen-graham/taking-closer-look-gwen-grahams-claim-about-storm-/	Gwen Graham, a former Democratic congresswoman running for Florida governor, said state leaders need to do more to prepare for the next hurricane, especially in the face of climate change. In an opinion-editorial for the Tampa Bay Times, Graham specifically focused on the state’s significant problem with infrastructure. "Our coastal and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change," Graham wrote. "They're two of the most critical areas during a storm, and received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016." We wondered about these grades as well as Graham’s larger point about climate change preparedness. Why Florida’s grades are poor Every four years since 2008, the Florida Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers has issued a report card outlining the condition of Florida’s infrastructure. The organization was founded in 1852 and represents more than 150,000 members of the civil engineering profession in 177 countries, making it the oldest engineering society in the country. A committee of civil engineers updates the card and gives out 11 grades on different sectors of infrastructure, including bridges, energy and school facilities, to create an an average grade. (Florida’s grade point average was a C in 2016.) Florida’s highest marks were in ports (B-minus), aviation (B-minus) and bridges (B) in the group’s 2016 report card. As Graham said, coastal and stormwater infrastructure scored poorly. The worst grade, F, is given out to infrastructure with "widespread advanced signs of deterioration," and designates that the infrastructure is unfit for what it’s supposed to do. Getting a D isn’t much better: "The infrastructure is in poor to fair condition and mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of their service life. A large portion of the system exhibits significant deterioration. Condition and capacity are of serious concern with strong risk of failure." The section about coastal areas takes a close look at the Sunshine State's 825 miles of beaches. That area received a D-plus grade in 2016, jsut like Graham said. According to the organization, almost 61 percent of Florida’s beaches are eroding and need "ongoing maintenance" to fight the trend. The group put some of the fault on state policymakers, adding that "over the last 10 years, the average difference between requested and state appropriated funds exceeded $40 million per year." It shouldn’t come as a surprise that hurricanes and major storm events can really mess up coastal areas and beaches. During periods of extreme rain, the chance for flooding increases. Flooding combined with wind, leads to beach erosion and jeopardizes the integrity of important infrastructure, like power plants, along the coast. Florida’s stormwater infrastructure, which include the drains that capture excess rain water and transport it for cleaning, received a D. Based on the ASCE’s assessment, Florida needs about $1.1 billion through 2019 to update its stormwater infrastructure. However, as needs for improvement have increased, utility fees to upkeep the systems have decreased since 2011. Stormwater infrastructure is put into overdrive during storms and hurricanes. Increasing the amount of water compromises the natural ability of the ground to absorb water, making stormwater systems function worse. There’s no doubt that stormwater and coastal area infrastructure are critical when a storm hits, and experts agreed that the ASCE’s assessment is right on track. Experts said that coastal infrastructure does not work well under "king" tides, heavy storms, or heavy rains in part because of the state's low elevation, lack of pumping of water and some lack of attention. "Stormwater (issues), like water and sewer, are not very glamorous and are therefore often ignored until they hit crisis mode," said Fred Bloetscher, an American Society of Civil Engineers member and a civil, environmental and geomatics engineering professor at Florida Atlantic University. Experts also agreed that the crux of Graham’s claim — that Florida's coastal and stormwater infrastructure is not prepared to handle climate change — is also accurate. That’s in part because the state isn’t taking preventative measures to better prepare. For example, experts said a starting point for Florida would be to tighten building codes and increase the number of "disaster reduction structures." Experts at the University of South Florida pointed to the "monolithic concrete dome home" that easily withstands hurricane winds and flooding events. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "We wonder why we don't see more of these," said T.H. Culhane, the director of climate change and sustainability at the University of South Florida. But not all hope is lost, according to Dave Randle, USF's director of sustainable tourism. "It might be too late for the next hurricane but the sooner we start the more we could prevent damage in the future," Randle said. Our ruling Graham said that Florida’s coastal area and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change, adding that the state "received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016." Graham is accurately citing a report card given out by the oldest engineering society in the country and experts vouched for the group’s assessment and Graham’s larger point. Florida has failed to take preventative measures in the past and it needs to update its existing infrastructure to prepare for climate change. We rate this claim True.

pomt-06292	Stimulus money went to "office upgrades for politicians."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/nov/19/crossroads-gps/crossroads-grassroots-policy-strategy-claims-39-mi/	Nothing suggests a boondoggle like tens of millions of federal dollars spent on office upgrades for politicians. At least that’s the impression left by an advertisement that started running in Virginia this month. The spot, which takes aim at Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine, comes from Crossroads Global Policy Studies, a Republican-aligned advocacy group. The ad shows footage of Tim Kaine referring to stimulus funding passed under president Barack Obama. "The stimulus is critically important to put people back to work," Kaine says. Then, with no small hint of sarcasm, the ad says stimulus money went to "critically important projects" such as "office upgrades for politicians." The 35-second spot then lists $39 million as the price tag of that endeavor. Nate Hodson, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, told us in an e-mail that his group’s claim is a reference to the latest phase of a renovation of the Kansas state capitol building. This is a familiar claim for PolitiFact, which debunked a similar charge that surfaced in the 2010 New Hampshire U.S. Senate race. Since it’s popping up again, we decided to weigh in on it once more. Hodson pointed to a July 7, 2010, story in The Bond Buyer, which notes the state took out a $39.7 million Build America Bond to help pay for the the latest phase of a decade-long renovation of the capitol. But that doesn’t mean, as the ad implies, that $39 million of federal stimulus money was spent directly on the project. "That’s not the case at all," said Marilyn Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Administration, which oversees the capitol building. The Build America Bonds were created as part of the 2009 stimulus -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A U.S. Treasury Department summary notes that the federal government pays 35 percent of the interest costs on the bonds, and the state or local government issuing the bond pays the rest of the interest. The idea is to give states a lower interest rate and thereby boost infrastructure projects and the economy. The state sells the bond to investors, and it’s the state -- not the federal government -- that pays back the principal on the bond, Jacobson said. The costs for the federal government to finance its share of the interest over the life of the bond -- which matures in 2030 -- would be a fraction of the $39 million cited in the ad. Jim MacMurray, vice president of finance at the Kansas Development Finance Authority, estimated the federal government’s total cost of paying for its share of interest would come to $8.8 million over the life of the 20-year bond. There’s another problem with the Crossroads claim -- the contention that this is simply a project to "upgrade politicians’ offices." It’s true that office space renovations have been part of the project. But Jacobson said that’s just one part of an overall restoration to completely overhaul the state capitol, which is more than 100 years old. Work includes replacing the leaky limestone exterior, installing new heating and air conditioning systems as well as getting rid of century-old electrical wiring, she said. "Office space is a very small piece of the whole thing," Jacobson said. Our ruling The Crossroads ad says that $39 million in stimulus money went to "office upgrades for politicians," a reference to the latest phase in renovating the Kansas state capitol building. First of all, the $39 million is not a direct payment for the renovation. That’s the amount the state will repay along with most of the interest through a bond program started by the 2009 stimulus. The federal government pays for some interest costs, but those expenses are nowhere near $39 million. Although it’s true that office upgrades are part of the project, new offices are just one part of a much bigger project to completely restore the building. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14930	Says he "didn’t have an involvement with" nutritional supplement company Mannatech.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/29/ben-carson/debate-ben-carson-says-he-has-no-connection-mannat/	Ben Carson said it’s "total propaganda" to suggest he had any connection to Mannatech, a maligned nutritional supplement company. At the Oct. 28 Republican presidential debate, hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colo., moderator Carl Quintanilla asked Carson about his involvement with the company. "This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship," Quintanilla said. "They offered claims they could cure autism, cancer. They paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet your involvement continues. Why?" "Well, that’s easy to answer: I didn’t have an involvement with them," replied Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon. "That is total propaganda. And this is what happens in our society -- total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of relationship with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it’s a good product." Mannatech sells nutritional supplement pills made from larch tree bark and aloe, ingredients with disputed health benefits. The company in 2009 settled the lawsuit, which stemmed from claims that the company was deceptively pitching cures and treatments for illnesses such as cancer and even Down Syndrome. For Carson to say he "didn’t have an involvement with" Mannatech is a stretch. While he was not any sort of employee for the company as far as we can tell, it’s hard to see the speeches he’s delivered, as well as other promotional work, as anything but a full-throated endorsement of the product. Further, Mannatech appears to view Carson as a product promoter. First, the speeches. Carson has delivered four to Mannatech, according to the Wall Street Journal. Carson has written these paid remarks off as just several of many diverse speeches the Washington Speakers Bureau have booked for him. But in the speeches, he talks about his personal fondness for the product, which he started taking in conjunction with cancer treatment years ago. For example, Carson delivered remarks to Mannatech sales associates in 2004. In the speech, he talked about his introduction to Mannatech’s supplements and a personal conversation he had with the company’s lead doctor. "I started taking the product, and within about three weeks, my symptoms went away," adding that he toyed with the idea of using only the supplements, rather than undergoing cancer surgery. He said in the remarks that it would be inappropriate for him to be an official spokesman or sales associate, but he does refer people to Mannatech. Since then, he has appeared in Mannatech-produced videos that appear to be promotional materials. In 2011, he answered questions in an interview with Mannatech’s co-CEO and chief science officer. In a 2013 Mannatech video, Carson described his experience with nutritional supplements. "The wonderful thing about a company like Mannatech is that they recognize that when God made us, he gave us the right fuel. And that fuel was the right kind of healthy food," Carson said in the 2013 video. "Basically what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural diet as a medicine or as a mechanism for maintaining health." Carson also talked about his use of nutritional supplements on PBS in 2014, and Mannatech promoted the interview on its homepage. While it’s no longer accessible, the Mannatech website had a specific tag for all articles about Carson. Carson’s campaign requested that Mannatech remove some videos and articles featuring Carson from its website. And since media outlets have started poking around this question, Mannatech has taken down even more, according to reporters at the Wall Street Journal. Our ruling Carson said, "I didn’t have an involvement with" the nutritional supplement company Mannatech. As far as we can tell, Carson was not a paid employee or official endorser of the product. However, his claim suggests he has no ties to Mannatech whatsoever. In reality, he got paid to deliver speeches to Mannatech and appeared in promotional videos, and he consistently delivered glowing reviews of the nutritional supplements. As a world-renowned surgeon, Carson’s opinion on health issues carries weight, and Mannatech has used Carson’s endorsement to its advantage. We rate Carson’s claim False.

pomt-02416	The new Ukrainian government "introduced a law abolishing the use of languages other than Ukrainian in official circumstances."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/05/russia-today/russia-backed-american-news-network-offers-its-ow/	While it would be easy, and maybe even largely accurate, to see Russia’s moves in the Crimean Peninsula as a power-play pure and simple, Moscow gives other reasons. All of them have to do with protecting Russian citizens or ethnic Russians in Ukraine. Russia Today, a Kremlin-financed news organization, offered this brief explanation at the very end of its article on the Russian troops stationed at bases in Crimea. "Authorities in the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic of Crimea – where more than half the population is Russian – requested Moscow’s assistance after the self-proclaimed government in Kiev introduced a law abolishing the use of languages other than Ukrainian in official circumstances." We thought we’d check the last part of that sentence. Did the new Ukrainian government introduce "a law abolishing the use of languages other than Ukrainian in official circumstances?" The quick answer is, yes -- with a big but. We’ll walk you through it. The 1996 Constitution and situation in Crimea In 1996, the Ukraine Constitution made Ukrainian the country’s official language. Ukraine is a polyglot nation. About two-thirds of the people speak Ukrainian, about a quarter speak Russian, and another 10 percent speak Hungarian, Romanian, Polish and Tatar. Not surprisingly, each language tends to cluster in particular places. The Constitution, however, also included protections for other languages including Russian: "Free development, use, and protection of Russian and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine shall be guaranteed in Ukraine." In 1998, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea got its own constitution that placed Russian as a second official language. Article X held that "Russian, being the language spoken by the majority of the population and the language acceptable for purposes of interethnic communication, shall be used in all spheres of public life." That included legal documents, court proceedings and public services. Bill Bowring is a Britsh legal scholar who studied the language laws in Ukraine and visited Crimea with European monitors. He was last there in 2010 and found Russian used in all official business. "You could go in to a government office or courtroom and you would only hear Russian," Bowring said. "Anyone who says the Russian-speakers were in any way suppressed would be talking nonsense." Even a 1999 ruling from Ukraine’s Constitutional Court that affirmed the predominance of Ukrainian included this exception: "Local government bodies, bodies of Crimean Autonomous Republic and local self-government bodies may use Russian and other languages of national minorities along with the state language." So at least since 1999, Russian was considered an official language of Crimea, but other parts of Ukraine had less protection. More recent developments Fast forward to 2012. Parliamentary elections grew close and then-President Viktor Yanukovych worried that his Russian-leaning party would lose ground. Ahead of the elections, Yanukovych pushed for and won passage of a new language law. It gave local and regional governments the power to give any language official status so long as at least 10 percent of the people spoke it as their native tongue. This had widest resonance for Russian speakers, but it also made a difference for communities where other languages were common. Nearly half of Ukraine’s regions, 13 out of 27, made Russian a second official language. That law afforded language protections to even more people, but when Yanukovych was ousted last month, the new Ukranian parliament also voted to roll back the 2012 law. "In the first parliamentary session, that tolerant 2012 law was revoked, which meant that the country reverted to the earlier legislation," said Keith Darden, a professor of international relations at American University. The parliament voted on Sunday, March 2. By Wednesday, a backlash had begun, but not solely in Russian quarters. That day, the western city of Lviv, a center of Ukrainian nationalism, protested the repeal of the 2012 law and declared a day of speaking Russian. The government of Hungary slammed the move as well. By Friday, Russian troops had taken positions at the airports and other key centers in Crimea. On Sunday, the interim President Oleksandr Turchynov, stepped in and said he would not sign the repeal into law. "He said that he wasn’t going to approve the repeal of the law," said Olga Oliker, an Eastern Europe security analyst at the RAND Corporation. Oliker believes that Turchynov would have vetoed the parliament’s action under any circumstances, but the sequence of events is clear. The parliament attempted to reassert the sole official status of Ukrainian and then the Russian troops moved in. We reached out to Russia Today and did not hear back. Our ruling Russia Today said the Ukrainians introduced a law abolishing the use of any language except Ukrainian for official business. The Ukrainian parliament did vote to repeal a 2012 law that allowed for more official languages in parts of the country. But the repeal vote was not signed into law by the Ukraine’s interim president. Also, Crimea -- the center of the crisis currently in Ukraine -- has long held a special status whereby both Russian and Ukrainian could be used in official business. The recent vote would not have changed that, experts told us. We make no determination as to whether the parliament’s move triggered a call for aid from officials in Crimea. But on the question of the official language, the statement omits significant context. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Russia Today	None	None	None	2014-03-05T14:25:11	2014-03-04	['Ukraine']
pomt-06775	"In Texas, we teach both creationism and evolution in our public schools."	false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/19/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-public-schools-teach-evo/	Stumping in New Hampshire Aug. 18, Gov. Rick Perry responded to a woman urging her child to ask him about evolution, according to a blog post by ABC News. "Here your mom was asking about evolution, and you know it's a theory that's out there, and it's got some gaps in it," Perry said. "In Texas, we teach both creationism and evolution in our public schools — because I figure you're smart enough to figure out which one is right." We wondered whether he’s correct that creationism, the biblical explanation of human origins, and evolution, the scientific theory, are both taught in Texas public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional because it amounts to the endorsement of religion, according to Kristi Bowman, a Michigan State University law professor and expert in education law. She pointed to a 1987 decision striking down a Louisiana law that said evolution instruction in public schools was not allowed unless it was accompanied by instruction in "creation science." We looked at the state's current science curriculum standards, which make no mention of creationism while indicating that evolutionary theory should be covered in high school classes. The high school biology standards say that in all fields of science, students should analyze, evaluate and critique scientific explanations using empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental and observational testing, including "examining all sides of scientific evidence of those scientific explanations, so as to encourage critical thinking." According to the standards, biology classes are to present evolutionary theory as a "scientific explanation for the unity and diversity of life." Instructional details in the standards touch on fossil records, natural selection, adaptation and genetic mutation, among other topics. The Texas State Board of Education adopted those curriculum standards in 2009, and the revision process drew national attention as some conservatives pushed for inclusion of provisions that could cast doubt on evolution. The final version was described by some state board members as a compromise between "those who are critical of teaching evolutionary theories without scrutiny and those who feared attacks on evolution would lead to the teaching of creationism in Texas schools," according to a March, 28, 2009, Austin American-Statesman news article. The revised standards removed the requirement that students be taught the "strengths and weaknesses" of scientific theories. Opponents of the "strengths and weaknesses" provision argued that it would eventually open the door to teaching creationism in science classes, according to a March 26, 2009, news story in the Dallas Morning News, while supporters pointed out that the rule had already been in the standards for two decades. However, the board added the requirement that "all sides" of theories be scrutinized. In a March 27, 2009, article, the Houston Chronicle quoted a lawyer for the Seattle-based Discovery Institute, which is an advocate of the idea that the universe is the product of an intelligent designer, as saying that the "all sides" requirement "is the strongest critical thinking standard in any state science standards." The Statesman story reported that the institute called the new standards "a huge victory for those who favor teaching the scientific evidence for and against evolution." After the approval of the standards, the Texas Freedom Network, which calls itself a mainstream voice to counter the religious right, still saw reason for concern. In a press release, network President Kathy Miller said: "The word 'weaknesses' no longer appears in the science standards. But the document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms." The first test came this July when the Texas board adopted online science materials for public school classrooms to supplement current textbooks. The new materials had to follow the curriculum standards that the board approved in 2009. A July 22, 2011, Statesman article reported that none of the high school biology submissions up for consideration by the board included teaching of either creationism or intelligent design. The one offering that did touch on intelligent design failed to make the list of materials recommended to the board by Education Commissioner Robert Scott. Nor did the Republican-controlled board add it. However, the approval of the supplemental materials followed a discussion among board members of claims of errors in how evolution was addressed in a submission from publisher Holt McDougal, the Statesman story said. The publisher maintained that the points at issue, identified by a board-appointed reviewer, were not wrong. The Statesman story also reported that five other reviewers of the biology materials — four teachers and a professor — said in a letter to the board that the error claims "seem entirely dedicated to undermining the presentation of evolution. Many of the claims derive from overtly creationist literature and arguments." In the end, board members chose to turn the issue over to Scott, who later determined that Holt McDougal had "sufficiently addressed all eight of the reported errors," according to an Aug. 10 memo to the board from the Texas Education Agency. In an Aug. 15 news release, the Texas Freedom Network applauded the final version of the Holt McDougal materials, saying they were "in line with established mainstream science." Finally, we wondered what teachers are actually teaching in science classrooms. Penn State University political scientist Eric Plutzer, who helped conduct a 2007 national survey of more than 950 science teachers in 49 states, including Texas, told us in an interview that in any state 10 percent to 20 percent of science teachers are "endorsing creationism in their classrooms, often devoting one to four class hours to creationism over the course of the year." A synopsis of the survey, published in the Jan. 27, 2011, issue of Science magazine, says a "sizable number of teachers expose their students to all positions — scientific or not." Plutzer told us: "One thing you can be certain of is that large numbers of public school science teachers in Texas are endorsing creationism." In separate interviews, two advocates for science teachers agreed that some Texas teachers could be teaching creationism, but they stressed that the state doesn't require or even authorize that. "It is false to say that is how it’s supposed to be done," said Josh Rosenau, an analyst for the California-based National Center for Science Education. Chuck Hempstead, executive director of the Science Teachers Association of Texas, said the Texas curriculum standards "require the teaching of evolution. Creationism is not science and is not addressed in Texas public schools." John West, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, told us that the science standards don't call for the teaching of creationism or intelligent design. He also said the institute's view is that the recently approved science materials don't meet the curriculum standards' requirement that "all sides" of evolutionary theory be analyzed, including information that is critical of evolution. As we looked into Perry’s statement, his spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said by email: "It is required that students evaluate and analyze the theory of evolution, and creationism very likely comes up and is discussed in that process. Teachers are also permitted to discuss it with students in that context." The Texas Education Agency sent us a similar statement. Our sense: No doubt, some Texas teachers address the subject of creationism. But it’s not state law or policy to intermix instruction on creationism and evolution. We rate Perry’s statement False.

pomt-12020	"Seventy-six percent of the American people support us passing the DREAM Act … with citizenship and legalization as part of it all. … More than 60 percent of Republicans support that."	true	/california/statements/2017/sep/19/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-claims-three-quarters-americans-suppo/	Though she’s in the minority in the Republican-controlled Congress, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gained newfound clout last week in shaping the nation’s immigration policy. She and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced they’d reached a deal with President Trump on protecting the Dreamers. The Dreamers are the 800,000 young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children and temporarily shielded from deportation under the Obama-era DACA program. About one quarter live in California. This week, Pelosi claimed three-quarters of Americans support what she described as the legislative solution for safeguarding Dreamers from deportation: the DREAM Act. First introduced in 2001, the DREAM Act is a bipartisan bill that would offer protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children as long as they meet certain requirements. It would also include a path to citizenship for those who graduate from U.S. high schools and attend college, enter the workforce, or enlist in a military program. Pelosi made her claim during a speech Sept. 18, 2017 at Sacramento State University: "Seventy-six percent of the American people support us passing the DREAM Act … with citizenship and legalization as part of it all. … More than 60 percent of Republicans support that." We interpreted the second portion of her statement, about citizenship and legalization, to mean Americans are comfortable with one or the other option, particularly for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Given the heated debate around immigration, we wanted to know whether such a large share of Americans really support the DREAM Act, or at least the key provisions of the bill. We set out on a fact check. Our research As evidence for the claim, Pelosi’s spokesman pointed to a Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted Aug. 31 through Sept. 3, 2017. The poll includes responses from nearly 2,000 registered voters. The questions didn’t mention the DREAM Act specifically, but instead asked about the main thrust of the legislation. Here’s the question that got the closest: "As you may know, Dreamers are young people who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children, often with their parents. Which of the following do you think is the best way to handle Dreamers?" • 58 percent said Dreamers "should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they meet certain requirements." • 18 percent said Dreamers "should be allowed to stay and become legal residents, but NOT citizens, if they meet certain requirements." Combined, this totals the 76 percent Pelosi cited. Backing up her point about Republican support, the poll found 69 percent of Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats surveyed favored one of these two options. Other polling The late August poll backs up Pelosi’s claim. But we wanted to know whether other polls had asked similar questions and whether they told a different story. Kathleen Frankovic, a leading expert on public opinion polling, told us there haven’t been many recent surveys specifically on the DREAM Act. The new version of the bill was only introduced in July 2017. She said in an email that other polling has shown "general support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants." She cited a September 2017 poll by The Economist/YouGov in which 69 percent favored either a path to citizenship or legal status when asked "Which comes closest to your view about illegal immigrants who are living in the U.S.?" The question did not specifically ask about Dreamers. Frankovic cautioned: "Since wording can affect answers on this subject, politicians can pick and choose the numbers they want to cite, the ones that make the strongest case for their position." A question in a CNN/ORC poll from March 2017 offers a more detailed description of the type of immigrant that should be considered for legal status. It results in a higher favorability rating. Respondents were asked: "Now, thinking about how the U.S. government should treat illegal immigrants who have been in this country for a number of years, hold a job, speak English and are willing to pay any back taxes that they owe. Would you favor or oppose a bill that allowed those immigrants to stay in this country rather than being deported and eventually allow them to apply for U.S. citizenship? Ninety percent said they favored such a bill. Gallup polls Three Gallup polls in recent years show increasing support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. • A December 2010 Gallup poll found 54 percent of Americans, at that time, supported allowing "illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to gain legal resident status if they join the military or go to college." It found 66 percent of Democrats favored it, while only 34 percent of Republicans backed the idea. • A July 2015 Gallup poll found 65 percent of U.S. adults favored a plan to allow immigrants who were living illegally in the U.S. to remain in the country and become citizens if they met certain requirements over time. • One year later, a July 2016 Gallup poll, found 84 percent of U.S. adults favored that idea. Looking at the parties, 91 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Republicans supported it. • A previous Politico/Morning Consult poll from April 2017, found 78 percent of respondents backed the idea of a path to citizenship or legal status under certain requirements. • Explaining his desire to find a legislative solution, President Trump claimed in September 2017 that 92 percent of Americans "agree on DACA," the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. PolitiFact national examined support for the temporary protection program and found high favorability ratings, but not as high as 92 percent. It rated Trump’s claim Half True. Our rating Rep. Nancy Pelosi recently said 76 percent of "the American people support us passing the DREAM Act … with citizenship and legalization as part of it all. … More than 60 percent of Republicans support that." We interpreted the second part of her claim to mean three-quarters of Americans support either a path to citizenship or legal status, particularly for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. A September 2017 poll by Politico/Morning Consult backs up these figures, as does an April 2017 poll by the same group. Gallup polls from recent years show increasing support for the key points of the DREAM Act, ranging from 54 percent in 2010 to 65 percent in 2015 to 84 percent in 2016. Additional surveys show about two-thirds to three-quarters of respondents have backed a path to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally, under certain conditions. Pelosi’s claim is backed up by the polling. We rate it True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-01256	"There would be tens of thousands of jobs created" if President Barack Obama approved the Keystone XL pipeline.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/11/anna-kooiman/fox-news-host-keystone-pipeline-would-create-tens-/	Republicans already have some things they’d like to do when they assume full control of Congress in January. Plans include reforming the tax code, renewing the fight against Obamacare and approving the Keystone XL pipeline, according to a Wall Street Journal editorial by House Speaker John Boehner and current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Fox and Friends fill-in host and reporter Anna Kooiman honed in on the latter initiative during a post-Election Day discussion about the GOP leaders’ plans. "And if you would just approve the Keystone XL pipeline, there would be tens of thousands of jobs created," Kooiman said Nov. 6, addressing President Barack Obama. The job-creation argument behind the controversial pipeline is one fact-checkers have reviewed many times. The bottom line: Keystone isn’t the massive jobs generator that some make it out to be. TransCanada’s project shuffling a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., has long been on hold pending a review by Obama and the State Department, which must determine if it "serves the national interest" because it crosses an international border. The pipeline would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014, delivering more than 800,000 barrels of oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast. As far as new jobs go, the State Department estimates the operation of the pipeline will only create 35 permanent, full-time jobs and 15 temporary contractors. The full-time workers would be "required for annual operations, including routine inspections, maintenance and repair." Some would work in a Nebraska field office. The lack of many full-time positions makes sense, given that the project is to build a pipeline so that tar sands can travel without the need of rail cars or ships. There are, however, temporary jobs that would be supported by building the $8 billion pipeline over one or two years. Over the course of up to two years of construction, the State Department estimates a total of 42,100 jobs "would be supported by construction of the proposed project." Some jobs are directly tied to the pipeline and construction. Other jobs are simply a nature of how spending $8 billion ripples out into the economy. And more than 99 percent are temporary. The State Department figures construction would require around 10,400 seasonal workers for stretches that would last either four or eight months. This works out to 3,900 "average annual" jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs each year if the project takes two years to finish. Construction work would be spread over four states, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, though most workers would be specialized and need to be brought in from outside those states, the report notes. TransCanada counts direct job creation a little differently, estimating about 9,000 overall positions for construction and manufacturing. These are not measured on an average annual basis, but on an overall basis. TransCanada argues this makes more sense because the nature of construction work is for contractors to move from one job to the next, even if it does not last for a year at a time. "We’ve always talked about the positions because that’s what we cut the paychecks for," said TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard. By either estimate, the number of direct pipeline jobs created is not in the tens of thousands. To get there, you need to also include indirect and induced "spin-off" jobs. Indirect jobs are a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews. Induced jobs are jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy. The State Department estimates that 26,100 indirect and induced jobs "would be supported by construction of the proposed project" during the construction phase. The jobs would be in providing the supply chain to Keystone as well as employee spending on lodging, food, entertainment, health care, etc. The State Department calls these jobs "supported" and not created because it includes jobs that already exist. Put it all together and you get very few permanent jobs, about 10,000 or so temporary jobs in construction and another 26,000 more temporary spin-off jobs that could be created or supported. Two additional notes: According to The Globe and Mail newspaper of Canada, the pipeline extension’s cost has risen from $5.4 billion to $8 billion. But it’s unclear if higher costs can be associated with more jobs, said Ian Goodman, president of the Goodman Group Ltd. energy and economic consulting firm. Goodman co-authored a 2011 report questioning the project’s employment potential. The increased cost factors in inflation and financing costs. "The higher costs now being estimated by TransCanada may just be paying more dollars for a similar amount of actual work and materials to build the project." There’s still no word on when the State Department may announce its recommendation on the project. "We gave up guessing on that a while ago," Howard said, "but the facts on the project haven’t changed." Our ruling Kooiman said the Keystone XL pipeline would create "tens of thousands of jobs." A State Department review found the project could support -- not create -- 42,100 jobs. But that number needs considerable explanation and does not amount to tens of thousands of full-time jobs in the most common sense of employment. The figure represents the project’s estimated direct, indirect and induced jobs over two years of construction, and all but 50 are temporary. The State Department and TransCanada have different ways of accounting for jobs needed for the building phase, but neither estimate is in the tens of thousands. And some of the remaining indirect and induced jobs supported by subcontractors and employee spending may already exist, so that’s not exactly jobs creation as much as jobs enhancement. Kooiman’s claim is based on a seed of truth but lacks critical information. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Anna Kooiman	None	None	None	2014-11-11T10:26:45	2014-11-06	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-13890	"DUI arrests dropped significantly in Tampa once Uber began operating here."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/29/dana-young/do-dui-arrests-plummet-when-uber-comes-town/	As the debate over regulation of Uber continues across the country, Florida House Majority Leader Dana Young, R-Tampa, took to Twitter with a factoid about the ridesharing company’s effect on DUIs in her home city. "DUI arrests dropped significantly in Tampa once Uber began operating here," Young tweeted June 21. "The Austin situation is disturbing." Young was responding to a tweet by conservative focus-group leader Frank Luntz, who said the number of DUI arrests has increased in Austin, Texas, since Uber and Lyft ceased operations in May. Luntz’s tweet linked to an article that discussed the aftermath of Austin abandoning the ridesharing companies. After talking to experts and analyzing the data, we found the relationship between DUIs and Uber isn’t as clear-cut as Young makes it seem. The road to the truth This isn’t the first time Young, who is running for the Florida Senate, has fought in favor of Uber, which arrived in Hillsborough County in April 2014. Lyft arrived the same month. In February 2016, Young co-sponsored a bill (HB 1439) that would stop the Hillsborough Public Transportation Commission from treating ridesharing apps like taxicabs. In 2015, the Hillsborough County legislative delegation advanced a bill (HB 509) that would regulate ride-sharing companies. Before the bill passed, Young proposed an amendment with stipulations for background checks but didn’t include fingerprinting, which is required for Hillsborough County taxicab and limousine drivers. With Young’s interest in mind, we turned to the evidence. Young’s communication team sent data to support the claim, but it only included two six-month periods from January-June in 2014 and 2015. Although the data from 2014 and 2015 shows a 30 percent decrease in DUI arrests, it cherrypicks the timeframe. Kelsey Swithers, a spokeswoman for Young, said the data was the most recent information that Tampa police had as Young prepared a local bill. We requested more recent, comprehensive data from the police department. It shows the number of DUI arrests has fluctuated since 2012. Before we get into the numbers, here’s a few things to know: Other law enforcement organizations like the Hillsborough County Sheriff Department also make DUI arrests in Tampa, which aren’t reflected in these numbers. However, arrests by Tampa police far outnumber those from other agencies in Tampa. The data includes DUI arrests from different categories, whether it is a simple DUI stop or a serious car accident where a person was driving under the influence. So let’s look at what the numbers show. Graphic by Lauren Flannery It’s hard to detect a general trend in the data. For instance, the total number of DUIs between 2012 and 2013 decreased by 135 arrests, but the total number of total DUI arrests increased by 64 between 2013 and 2014. There was a general decline in DUI arrests after Uber came to town, with arrests staggering between 103 and 136 for most of 2015 — compared to a June 2014 high of 185. But at the beginning of 2016, arrests for DUI increased again to pre-Uber levels. Tampa police spokesman Stephen Hegarty cautioned that a number of factors could explain the volatility in the numbers, including announcements of DUI checkpoints and heightened enforcement around holidays. Still, Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University, said there may be something to Young’s theory based on the preliminary evidence for 2015, even if it doesn’t control for other factors. There were 414 fewer DUI arrests in 2015 than in 2014. It probably took around nine months before the number of Uber drivers was meaningful, Bales said, so it’s fair to use DUI stats from 2013 to 2014 as pre-Uber DUI trends. "The fact that DUI arrests declined by 22.2 percent from 2014 to 2015, which is arguably the first full year of operation, suggests Uber has had a significant impact on DUI arrests," Bales said. So case closed? Not exactly. Correlation ≠ causation Academic research rarely makes assertions like Young’s tweet, Bales said. "The reality is we can’t control for everything," Bales said. "We rarely make the claim that X caused Y at this level. We’re not that precise." Researchers behind a three-year study (not yet peer-reviewed) of Uber in 150 cities did conclude that Uber lowers the rate of fatal crashes and DUI arrests. The study, which did not include Tampa because it examined 2010-13 data, was just finished in May. Sean Mulholland, co-author of the study and professor of economics at Stonehill College, said they were able to draw broad conclusions about Uber’s influence because of the large sample size. "When looking at only one city or county, there might be other factors unique to the city that are driving the decline," Mulholland said. "But when we look at many cities, we are able to hold constant any unique factors that do not change over the years of the study." In addition to all of the factors potentially influencing DUI stats, the culture of drinking and driving has changed over the last several decades, said Thomas Blomberg, executive director of the Center for Criminology and Public Policy Research at Florida State. The portrayal of DUI stops in media is just one way people have become less deterred from getting behind the wheel while under the influence. Our ruling Young said DUI arrests dropped dramatically when Uber came to Tampa. Uber came to Tampa in April 2014, and DUIs did drop that month, and continued to do so in 2015. However, experts cautioned that there are many more factors that can affect the number of DUI incidents, so attributing the drop to solely to Uber is unscientific. Plus, more comprehensive data show the number of DUI arrests has fluctuated over recent years.

pomt-12591	"The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/06/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-garbles-climate-change-comments-obam/	During an appearance on Bill Maher’s HBO show, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., tried to convince the generally liberal host that Donald Trump was right to shelve Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which placed stricter standards on carbon emissions from power plants as a way of curbing pollution and climate change. "The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions," Santorum said. "That's what she said. Go look it up." As if Santorum’s suggestion to "look it up" wasn’t enough of a prompt for us to take a look, a number of readers also suggested we analyze his statement. So we did. What was the Clean Power Plan? In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Scientists say that carbon emissions are a significant contributor to global climate change. Advocates added that the Clean Power Plan would also reduce other emissions that create soot and smog. However, after opponents sued the Obama administration and found some success in the courts, the plan was never implemented. Then, on March 28, President Donald Trump, as expected, issued an executive order that set in motion the plan’s dismantling. What was Santorum referring to? The primary piece of evidence for Santorum’s statement, according to Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon, was an exchange at a House Science Committee hearing on July 9, 2015, including questioning of Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. Here’s the exchange: Smith: "On the Clean Power Plan, former Obama Administration Assistant Secretary, Charles McConnell said it best, that it will reduce global temperature by only 1/100th of a degree Celsius. At the same time, it is going to increase the cost of electricity, that's going to hurt the lowest income Americans the most. How do you justify such an expensive burden, some -- rule that is really not going to do much good, and isn't this all pain and no gain?" McCarthy: "No sir. I don't agree with you. If you look at the RIA we did, the Regulatory Impact Analysis, you would see it's enormously beneficial. The value of this…" Smith: "Would you consider 1/100th of a degree to be enormously beneficial?" McCarthy: "The value of this rule is not measured in that way. It is measured in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action to address what is a…" Smith: "Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree figure? Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree?" McCarthy: "I’m not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if (we) don't take action domestically, we will never get started." Smith: "But if you're looking at the results, the results can't justify the cost and the burden that you are imposing on the American people." McCarthy: "Actually this is a cost-beneficial rule…" Did McCarthy say the rule would have "no effect on man-made CO2 emissions"? First, we should point out that neither Smith nor McCarthy mentioned emissions per se in their exchange -- they discussed temperatures, a related but separate factor. Beyond that, though, McCarthy actually didn't say the plan would have "no effect." It would be more accurate to say McCarthy sidestepped the question. After McCarthy’s non-response to Smith’s question, the lawmaker didn’t follow up on that specific line of questioning. Because of McCarthy’s verbal fancy footwork, it’s a stretch for Santorum to say McCarthy acknowledged the view that the Clean Power Plan would have "no effect" on carbon emissions. In the meantime, Benyon provided some additional pieces of supporting evidence. However, they did not directly support Santorum’s statement. Benyon cited comments by an earlier EPA administrator under Obama, Lisa Jackson, at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. At the hearing, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., showed Jackson a chart showing "virtually no change" in carbon dioxide and asked her if she agreed with it. Jackson responded, "I believe that essential parts of the chart are that the U.S. acting alone will not impact the world's CO2 levels. But as we've all said, and as many members of this committee said, the race is on for us to enter into a clean energy future. There is technology in this country that can be used to move markets not only here, but abroad, and that means jobs for Americans that we are currently losing." This is actually a stronger example of an Obama EPA administrator acknowledging the limitations of curbing carbon emissions. However, this hearing was held in 2009, long before the Clean Power Plan was unveiled. (In fact, in 2009, the Obama administration was pursuing legislation, not regulation, on carbon emissions.) Benyon also cited prepared testimony in 2016 by former Obama assistant energy secretary for fossil fuels Charles McConnell. "What is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA’s (Clean Power Plan) is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions." McConnell wrote. He cited calculations that the Clean Power Plan would reduce global temperatures by 0.01 degrees Fahrenheit and that the reduction in sea level rise would be only as wide as two human hairs. "These are facts, and facts are stubborn things," he said. But again, Santorum wasn’t citing just any senior Obama administration official but specifically the head of the EPA. Does Santorum have a point anyway? Some researchers have expressed skepticism about the Clean Power Plan’s value. Benjamin Zycher of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Patrick Michaels and Paul Knappenberger of the libertarian Cato Institute, have pointed to calculations using a model known as MAGICC, which EPA itself has used. The model suggests that the Clean Power Plan would reduce temperatures by small fractions of a degree, varying by the assumptions made. A wide range of climate scientists and policy experts we checked with offered some counterpoints. First, they said the United States needs to take its own steps to curb carbon production if the rest of the world is going to follow. "Everyone acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan alone isn't enough to stop climate change, but that's a rather ridiculous bar to hold for a single regulation," said William Anderegg, a biologist at the University of Utah. "What is clear, however, is that the Clean Power Plan is likely the single most critical piece of U.S. action to fulfill our commitments under the Paris Agreement." Second, they argued that even a small reduction would be preferable to the upward trend line the world would likely see otherwise. "Reducing the temperature of the atmosphere by 1/100th of a degree is in fact really significant," said Harold Wanless, who chairs the department of geological sciences at the University of Miami. "We shot up several hundredths of a degree last year alone. Every hundredth of a degree cooled is a step in the right direction." Finally, Santorum's perspective "misses the thousands of lives per year we're already saving each year by cutting coal use," said Rob Jackson, a professor at the Stanford University School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. And tallying up the impact of just the Clean Power Plan ignores other carbon-reduction policies pursued by the Obama administration, including higher vehicle fuel economy standards, regulations on other greenhouse gases such as methane, and heightened energy-efficiency requirements for buildings and appliances. Reasonable people can disagree about whether the costs on utilities, their employees and local economies justify such benefits. But focusing only on the global warming impact of the Clean Power Plan, as Santorum did, ignores these other considerations. Our ruling Santorum said, "The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up." Many scientists would acknowledge that the climate-change impact of U.S. action by itself would be modest. However, McCarthy didn’t actually say that, and few experts would peg the impact at zero, as Santorum did. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12746	Global poverty is down to "less than 10% today from 37% in 1990."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/01/boris-johnson/yes-global-poverty-fell-dramatically-after-1990/	British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson took a moment at the Munich Security Conference to praise the "unadulterated triumph of what you might broadly call western values, technology, culture, and indeed western economic thinking." Johnson’s main example? World poverty. "The proportion of the global population living in poverty (has) declined to fewer than 10 percent today from 37 percent in 1990," Johnson said Feb. 17, 2017. "An even more staggering accomplishment for the human race when you consider we have added 1.8 billion people to the planet in that time." Is Johnson on firm ground with those poverty stats? He is, with minor allowances for uncertainty in the data. According to the World Bank, in 1990, 35.1 percent of the total population had to survive on less than $1.90 per day, the official poverty line. In 2013, the most recent year in the World Bank’s Development Indicators database, the level stood at 10.7 percent. Bank economists estimated that in 2015, poverty had fallen to 9.6 percent. Economic gains in China and India largely drove the drop in the poverty rate. Charles Kenny, an economist at the Center for Global Development, a Washington policy group, told us there’s a little bit of give in the numbers. "The calculation of global poverty numbers has changed a number of times since 1990," Kenny said. "Each time they 'back-cast' to 1990 to create a new estimate of that old number." Kenny told us, given the unavoidable uncertainty in the data, "I'd say Boris was pretty much right." But he cautioned that not all regions have benefited equally. According to the World Bank, poverty in sub-Saharan Africa is just under 50 percent and the region has about twice as many poor people today as it had in 1980. "There are some stubborn pockets of poverty," Kenny said. Johnson also mentioned the world’s growing population. He said it went up 1.8 billion since 1990. The U.S. Census Bureau reports it rose 1.9 billion. Our ruling Johnson said global poverty fell from 37 percent to under 10 percent since 1990. His numbers are quite close to those of the World Bank. An economist familiar with the assumptions behind the data told us that there’s enough uncertainty in the figures that it’s fair to say that Johnson has it right. The one point Johnson’s summary ignores is that some regions such as sub-Saharan Africa have not seen as large a decline in poverty. So his numbers are correct, but the reality is very different depending on where you live.

You’d think that would be obvious just by looking at the picture, but it’s not, judging by the thousands of times it was shared on social media. "Breaking: Leaked picture of Obama being dragged before a judge in handcuffs for wiretapping Trump," reads the headline on several versions of the same Internet post on March 5, 2017. Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fake, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to stamp out fake news on its website. The stories are all essentially identical, saying authorities stopped Obama (wearing a fake moustache!) as he was trying to fly out of Toronto’s airport to an unspecified destination.

pomt-13707	In first week as governor, Tim Kaine "proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, $4 billion, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-tim-kaine-proposed-4-billion-tax/	Donald Trump told Virginians this week that Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, did a "lousy job" when he was governor of their state. "Less than a week after Tim Kaine became governor of Virginia - one week - he proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, $4 billion, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year," Trump said during a rally Monday in Roanoke. We decided to see whether Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, was right about Kaine’s record. The Trump campaign didn’t respond for our request for backing to his claim. Trump has, however, posted source materials on his campaign website that takes aim at Kaine’s fiscal record as governor from 2006 to 2010. The $4 billion Six days after taking office in January 2006, Kaine proposed an unsuccessful measure to raise $1 billion a year to deal with long-standing transportation woes. Trump’s campaign points to a next-day article in The Washington Post that said the plan would generate close to $4 billion by the time Kaine’s term ended in 2010. Kaine wanted to raise taxes on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. But not all of Kaine’s plan relied on raising broad taxes. About 15 percent of the revenue, or $150 million a year, would have come from assessing steep new fines on people who have chronically bad driving records. It’s a bit of a stretch to call those fines a tax, because those payments easily could have been avoided by following traffic laws. Taxing low incomes There’s no doubt that the tax and fee increases Kaine proposed in 2006 would have affected all Virginia car owners, including those earning as little as $17,000 or even less. Oddly, Trump may have had something entirely different in mind when he cited the $17,000. His campaign website uses that income threshold in referring to a proposal Kaine made at the end of his governorship, not the beginning. Kaine proposed another ill-fated tax increase in December 2009, his last full month as governor. At the time, Virginia’s economy was reeling from the shocks of the Great Recession. Kaine proposed raising state income tax rates for all brackets by 1 percentage point. The proposed tax increase - defeated in the first week after Kaine left office in 2010 - would have raised about $1.9 billion. That would have been offset by $650 million taxpayers would have saved by a Kaine proposal to eliminate Virginia’s personal property tax on vehicles. So the net effect of Kaine’s last-year plan would have been a $1.25 billion annual tax hike. PolitiFact Virginia, in 2012, looked into a claim that Kaine, during his last year, tried to raise taxes on people "earning as little as $17,000." It was made by Republican George Allen, whom Kaine defeated that year in a U.S. Senate race. We concluded that many, but not all, households with taxable incomes of $17,000 would have paid more taxes under Kaine’s proposal. But in some cases, if a person had a pretty good vehicle, his savings on the car tax repeal would have outweighed his increased income tax bill under Kaine’s plan. Kaine’s 2009 proposal actually would have affected Virginians with less than a $17,000 taxable income. At the time, Virginia required all individuals with taxable incomes of more than $11,950 to file state income taxes. Trump, we should note, altered his tax criticism of Kaine after he left Virginia. "First thing Tim Kaine did was have a $4 billion tax increase," he said Wednesday during a news conference at the Trump National Doral resort in Florida. In this instance, Trump didn’t link Kaine’s 2006 tax-hike proposal to people with low incomes. Our ruling Trump said Kaine, during his first week as governor, proposed a "nearly $4 billion tax increase" that would have hit people earning as little as $17,000. Kaine, six days after taking office in 2006, did propose a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Trump calls it a "nearly $4 billion tax increase," citing a figure used in a newspaper article at the time. But the article said that sum would be realized over four years. Trump, in using that high $4 billion figure, omits the clarifying time span. The tax package centered on raising levies on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. It would have affected people with taxable incomes of $17,000 or lower - if they had a car. So Trump’s statement largely is accurate but needs some clarification.

pomt-13116	"I had the longest judicial vacancy in the history of the United States."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/nov/03/richard-burr/sen-richard-burr-claims-responsibility-longest-jud/	Last week, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas lit into the political atmosphere in Washington, D.C. At a speech hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation, Thomas was asked about the politics surrounding judicial nominations. Thomas himself had a contentious confirmation process in the early 1990s, led by Senate Democrats, and for most of this year Senate Republicans have been pushing to keep the late Antonin Scalia’s seat empty. "At some point we have got to recognize that we’re destroying our institutions," Thomas said. A few days later, Republican Sen. Richard Burr took a different approach, in private comments that came to light in a leaked audio tape. In the tape, Burr claims responsibility for "the longest judicial vacancy in (U.S.) history" – specifically a seat on the federal district court serving Eastern North Carolina. He said it while pledging, if re-elected, to stonewall Supreme Court nominees from a hypothetical Hillary Clinton administration. "If Hillary becomes president, I’m going to do everything I can do to make sure that four years from now, we’re still going to have an opening on the Supreme Court," Burr said, earning a round of applause. "This is not tough for me," he added later. "I had the longest judicial vacancy in the history of the United States – on the Eastern District of North Carolina. Not many people know that." The vacancy he’s talking about is the longest current vacancy. But is it really the longest ever? And is Burr as responsible for it as he claims? We endeavored to find out. The vacant seat That district he’s talking about is a high-profile one, stretching from the capital in Raleigh to the coast. Its judges preside over political corruption trials as well as the many high-level drug trafficking cases that are made along Interstate 95. Judges are based in Raleigh, Fayetteville, Wilmington, Greenville, New Bern and Elizabeth City – but the Fayetteville seat is vacant. The federal government considers it a "judicial emergency," having now been vacant for nearly 4,000 days. That’s the seat Burr is talking about. But how much influence has he had on keeping it empty? A single senator’s power The U.S. Constitution instructs the president to nominate federal judges and instructs the Senate to confirm them. There are three levels of federal courts – district courts, appeals courts and the Supreme Court – which currently have a combined 102 vacancies. The longest-standing one is in Eastern North Carolina’s district court, and it’s not even close. That seat has been open nearly 11 years, since Dec. 31, 2005. The next-longest vacancy has existed since Jan. 7, 2010. Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is an expert on federal judicial nominations and vacancies. Traditionally, he said, nominees who won the support of both their home state’s senators would be confirmed, regardless of party politics. But that began changing in the late 1990s and early 2000s and has gotten even more partisan recently, he said. Wheeler said now, nominees might fail to be confirmed over political concerns even if they have the support of both home senators. But the Senate still follows a long-standing tradition not to confirm any nominee without both home senators’ support. "It's a little back-scratching," he said. "Senators realize they want to keep control of patronage in their state." How that applies to North Carolina Burr joined the Senate in January 2005, nearly a year before the vacancy occurred. In 2006, President Bush nominated Raleigh attorney Thomas Farr to the seat. Burr and then-Sen. Elizabeth Dole supported Farr – but Senate Democrats did nothing, so the vacancy continued into Obama’s tenure. Obama didn’t nominate anyone until 2013. Burr said he wouldn’t support that first nominee, federal prosecutor Jennifer May-Parker, so that stopped her nomination. Obama waited a few more years and then, this April, nominated Patricia Timmons-Goodson. Burr immediately said he would refuse to support the former N.C. Supreme Court justice, calling her choice "a brazenly political nomination." Both Timmons-Goodson and May-Parker are Democrats and black women. The eastern district has never had a black judge, although its black population is above the state average. In the leaked audio tape, Burr said he believes Obama broke a promise to him about a different nominee, so he told the president: "Let me make you a promise. This seat will be vacant on the day you go out of office." The all-time record? So Burr is partly responsible for the longest current vacancy. And among only district court seats, it does indeed hold the all-time record, according to Winston Bowman, an associate historian with the Federal Judicial Center. But Bowman said there has been at least one vacancy, at the appeals court level, that lasted even longer. And as fate would have it, Burr was involved in that one, too. A seat on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was open for just over 16 years, from 1994 to 2010. That seat is now held by James Wynn, a North Carolinian who replaced another North Carolina judge on the court, which oversees multiple East Coast states. Wynn was originally nominated by Bill Clinton, but the Senate made no move to confirm him. The seat remained empty during Bush’s two terms, and Wynn was renominated by Obama in 2009. Then-Sen. Kay Hagan, a fellow Democrat, endorsed his nomination and so did Burr, and in 2010 Wynn was confirmed by the Senate. It’s possible Burr’s support for Wynn was part of the deal he said he made with Obama, which now has him working to keep the eastern district seat empty, although we don’t know for sure. Burr’s team didn’t respond to our questions about the deal. Our ruling Sen. Richard Burr said he is personally responsible for "the longest judicial vacancy in the history of the United States." The 11-year vacancy he’s talking about does hold the record for federal district court seats, but not for all federal courts – at least not yet. In terms of his responsibility for the district court vacancy, Burr is right that he’s a large reason why it’s still empty. But he doesn’t get 100 percent of the credit or blame. Democrats blocked Bush’s nominee to the seat from 2006 until 2008. If they hadn’t, this vacancy would have been filled a decade ago. But that didn’t happen, and Burr is right that he’s responsible for keeping the seat empty. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09077	"Bill McCollum has accepted thousands from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/jun/25/rick-scott/bill-mccollum-and-his-supposed-planned-parenthood-/	Rick Scott's new campaign mailer is blasting his Republican primary opponent for governor, Bill McCollum, as being in the pocket of the pro-choice group Planned Parenthood. "Bill McCollum has accepted thousands from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood," says the outside of the mailer. The claim is printed over the top of an image of a faceless man wearing a Planned Parenthood button and taking a stack of money. The Planned Parenthood claim is repeated inside the mailer, which started appearing in mailboxes around June 23, 2010. The time, the line is next to a picture of McCollum and the Planned Parenthood logo and opposite is a picture of Rick Scott and a logo that reads "100% pro-life." We've already dipped into Scott's attacks against McCollum's pro-life resume, rating a claim that McCollum and President Barack Obama hold the same position on embryonic stem cell research Mostly True. In this item we wanted to fact-check McCollum's ties to Planned Parenthood, a connection that -- if true -- could be damaging in a GOP primary. The mail piece includes a footnote to substantiate Scott's claim, saying the lobbyist in question is the firm Arnold & Porter. The campaign then searched federal campaign finance databases to see Arnold & Porter's contributions to McCollum's previous federal campaigns. So we did the same thing. What we found is that if you tilt your head just so, stand on one leg and squint your eyes, Scott's claim might hold up. Maybe. Let us explain. The U.S. Senate keeps an excellent online lobbyist disclosure database that allows anyone to see who lobbyists are representing and how much they're being compensated. We searched to see who Planned Parenthood had retained as a federal lobbyist and indeed, Arnold & Porter is included. The Washington, D.C., firm is a full service law firm that also does legislative lobbying and public policy work. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the firm earned $4.45 million in 2009 lobbying on behalf of 28 different groups, including BP, the state of Oregon and Major League Baseball's Office of the Commissioner. Its biggest client in 2009 was Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris USA. According to the Senate lobbying database, Arnold & Porter was eligible to lobby for Planned Parenthood from 2000-2007. Arnold & Porter received $60,000 in 2000. The rest of the time, the firm received between $0 and $10,000 every six months for its work (federal rules don't require Arnold & Porter to break out amounts under $10,000). The U.S. House disclosure website lists Arnold & Porter as a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood in 2005, 2006 and 2007, receiving between $0 and $10,000 every six months. Arnold & Porter, the registered Planned Parenthood lobbyist, did contribute to McCollum -- a whopping $2,000 that we could identify. The firm's political action committee made two $1,000 contributions to McCollum's Congressional campaign account, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. The contributions came in 1997 and 1998. For the record, Arnold & Porter's political action committee also has donated to Republicans like former Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, current Florida U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, House Majority Leader John Boehner, and former President George W. Bush (and Sens. Lindsey Graham, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch and John McCain) (and the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee) (and Sens. Mitch McConnell and Trent Lott) (and Elizabeth Dole and Dick Armey) (and Sen. Saxby Chambliss and Rep. Eric Cantor, too). Here's the first problem: Arnold & Porter wasn't registered as a Planned Parenthood lobbyist when it made those contributions to McCollum, records show. And here's another one: It's a gigantic leap to say those contributions had anything to do with Planned Parenthood. Using the same logic, you can stick Bush, Boehner, Ashcroft and all those other Republicans with the same label. And then there's this: When McCollum ran for the U.S. Senate in 2000, the National Right To Life Political Action Committee spent $114,835 on his behalf. Oh, this, too: In his last year in Congress, 1999, McCollum received a 0 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. (We should note that when McCollum ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, the National Right to Life Committee endorsed Mel Martinez over McCollum, because McCollum said he supported an expansion of embryonic stem cell research. But that doesn't have anything to do with Scott's claim in this case). It appears to us that the Scott campaign is trying very hard to link McCollum and Planned Parenthood in an attempt to attack McCollum's pro-life credentials. They succeeded by finding a Washington law firm that at one point lobbied for Planned Parenthood and at another point gave $2,000 to McCollum. But there's no evidence -- scratch that. We don't think any logical person would conclude that Arnold & Porter's contributions to McCollum and its future business with Planned Parenthood have anything to do with the other.

Yet some of you out there are thinking it’s true. "Trump just gave every working, legal man, woman and child in the USA $612 each!" read the headlines on several posts from Feb. 14, 2017, or the following day. Facebook flagged several claims as part of its efforts to scour fake news from its news feeds. The article says a program called Tax Relief For Deserving Americans will pay working citizens, but "those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens" aren’t eligible. It also says public assistance recipients will get an extra $25 in "food stamps" if they are participating in work programs or job training. (The USDA food assistance program has been called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program since 2008.) The clues are clear, however, that this is completely fake. The first sentence of the story denigrates people on public assistance and illegal immigrants, and cites a statement from the "White House Communication and Propaganda Office," which does not exist. The post also includes made-up quotes allegedly from the president, hitting keywords from a wide range of Trump-friendly topics, including a wall on the Mexican border, borrowing money from the Chinese and imposing tariffs. The fake stories originate from a Feb. 14, 2017, article on TheLastLineOfDefense.org.

pomt-09070	Says he "fought against $3 billion in cuts to public education since 2003."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/28/dubose-porter/gubernatorial-candidate-touts-record-education-cut/	Democrats woo few voting blocs as ardently as they do teachers. This primary-election season, with the governor's seat up for grabs, their ritual mating dance is noisy. State Attorney General Thurbert Baker plans to feather education's nest with funds from bingo games. Former Gov. Roy Barnes, who critics say lost his seat as governor because he lost the teacher vote, is singing the praises of educators. State Rep. DuBose Porter of Dublin is pushing his long record in the state House of Representatives, during which he became a darling of education advocacy groups for his positions on school funding. A blog post on his campaign Web site titled "It all comes down to Education" proclaims that "Teachers need DuBose Porter as their Governor." The post gives 11 reasons why. This was No. 6: "Fought against $3 billion in cuts to public education since 2003." Which cuts were those? we wondered. And how did he fight? This item puts Porter's reputation as a proponent for education to the test. A search of a decade's-worth of newspaper clippings and interviews shows he frequently argued against what he saw as too little education funding, and singled out Gov. Sonny Perdue in his attacks. This year, when the House passed the 2010 amended budget, Porter said that "when we cut our teachers and we cut our schools, we shortchange our kids." In 2009, he opposed cuts to special supplementary payments to teachers who undergo a rigorous national certification process. In 2008, Porter advocated for two bills that he said would have boosted the money going to schools by changing funding procedures. In 2007, he wrote a column for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution challenging Perdue on statewide SAT scores and what he saw as cuts to education. In 2006, he criticized Perdue for education budget changes he made during his first term as governor. Porter argued in 2005 that more money needed to go to schools and teacher salaries. State education advocacy groups think Porter fought for them. Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association, was effusive in a recent e-mail. "I can say without fear of contradiction that Representative Porter has, in fact, raised numerous objections to the cuts to education," Garrett said. "He is among the most knowledgeable candidates on education funding [due to his many years of experience in the General Assembly and on education committees in particular], so he has a keen eye for how the education portion of the budget operates and when those in positions of power are playing games with it. He has called their hand publicly on a number of occasions." You get the point. Checking Porter's opposition to school spending cuts of all stripes is easy. Now, figuring out whether those cuts were worth $3 billion is a messier business. Porter and his backers argue there were billions of dollars of cuts under Perdue's reign. Perdue's office says the governor actually increased school funding by about $1 billion. How is this possible? Thank the murkiness of education financing in Georgia. The state's 1985 Quality Basic Education Act established the formula the state uses to dole out money to local school systems for k-12 students. Each year, the state plugs numbers into the formula to determine how much money to give. But the state budget doesn't have to follow the formula. For instance, for the 2010 budget year, the formula determined the state government should put about $1.35 billion more than it actually provided, according to budget documents from the state Department of Education. Because the state provided less than the QBE formula suggested, Porter and other groups such as the Georgia School Superintendents Association have said Perdue cut school funding by that amount in that budget year. If you total the difference between what the QBE formula kicked out and how much was allocated from fiscal year 2003 through 2010, you end up with about $3 billion worth of cuts, a Porter campaign representative said. In fact, this $3 billion is a little low, according to a PolitiFact Georgia analysis. We found cuts were at about $3.25 billion. If you count the fiscal year 2011 budget, which was just passed this spring, those cuts are about $4.3 billion, according to the state School Superintendents Association. Here's the problem. Some people don't count cuts this way. One of them is the governor. Perdue's office sent us a spreadsheet that detailed how they calculate changes in QBE funding, which essentially subtracts the later year's QBE amount from the earlier number. The difference from 2003 to 2010 is about $1 billion. So how do we determine whether Porter's statement is true? Even though numbers aren't typically thought of as subjective, in this case, whether or not you believe the budget was cut by $3 billion or increased by $1 billion is a matter of perspective. The arithmetic behind both calculations is correct, but the assumptions behind them are very different. For years, government types have argued whether a reduction in an expected increase counts as a budget cut. If you think it is a cut, you might believe the $3 billion number is correct because if the state fails to follow the QBE formula, they're shortchanging schools. Or you might think the formula is bunk and that it's important to give the state credit for increasing the overall amount by about $1 billion. Porter has consistently objected to what he saw as cuts to k-12 education that were the result of QBE funding shortfalls. He did so aggressively, calling out the governor by name.

"We’re confident that all voters want to continue moving forward and have no desire to return to the failed policies of the past." We heard the same claim by Walker’s campaign in early August. We’ve previously tested Walker’s deficit and income-tax claims -- the governor accurately claims credit on both -- and many of the Republican governor’s jobs claims while tracking his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by January 2015. But the "best two-year job growth in a decade" is a new one, and one voters are likely to hear repeatedly as the election nears. So let’s test it. Walker is referring to 2011 and 2012, his first two years in office. To examine the decade, we’ll use the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a thorough jobs count that economists, state and federal jobs officials and the Walker administration agree is the most accurate source. The figures, based on reports from more than 90% of public and private employers, are gathered by the state, then adjusted and published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest state-by-state figures through 2012 came out in mid-2013, prompting Walker to highlight the state’s improvement from 44th in job-creation to 33rd among the states. Walker’s new campaign claim isn’t specific to private-sector jobs or all jobs, so we’ll examine both the private world and the broader employment picture, including government jobs, though we note that Walker’s 250,000 promise was for the private side only. We went back to 2002 to get enough data to measure the changes in the last decade, so the baseline was the final year of Republican Gov. Scott McCallum’s brief tenure. The 2003-2010 figures belong to the era of Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. The most important number is 62,082 -- that’s how many more private-sector jobs existed at the end of December 2012 compared to the end of December 2010 -- the first two years of the Walker era. Walker was sworn in Jan. 3, 2011. Is it the best two-year period in the last decade? Wisconsin actually lost ground at times in the decade, most notably in 2008 and 2009 amid the worst effects of the prolonged national downturn dubbed the Great Recession. From the end of 2007 to the end of 2009, the private job tally in Wisconsin fell by a whopping 175,000 -- a drop of 7 percent. Doyle, we found, can’t claim a better two-year period than Walker’s 62,082 gain in private-sector jobs. But there is a two-year period that tops that -- December 2009 to December 2011, when the private jobs count jumped by 63,458. That period encompasses Doyle’s final year in office and Walker’s first, both of which came after the official end of the recession in mid-2009. The state’s employment turnaround began in 2010, Doyle’s final year, when the count jumped by more than 33,600, mirroring national gains. It has continued under Walker, though at a slightly slower pace in raw numbers. By comparison, the gains in Walker’s first two years were 29,800 and 32,282, respectively. What about the broader job count, including both the private and public sectors? We found two earlier periods that top Walker’s two-year mark on the combined total of private and public-sector jobs. The Walker-era total was 53,564. Before the recession, from the end of 2003 to the end of 2005 -- in Doyle’s era -- the job count grew by 58,062. The other total that topped 2011-12 was post-recession, in the Doyle-Walker period of 2010 and 2011. The bottom line here: Walker’s campaign claim falls short. In researching this item, we found earlier instances in which Walker made a similar claim, but in more precise and political terms. Example: In May 2013, the spokesman for Walker’s office told the Journal Sentinel: "Today, Wisconsin's private-sector job growth is the best two-year gain under any governor in over a decade." For this fact check, the Walker campaign pointed us to that same statement, made by the state’s workforce development agency. But that qualifier -- "any governor" -- makes a difference in the accuracy of the claim. As we’ve said, viewed that way, and looking at private-sector jobs only, Walker’s two years run ahead of any similar period under Doyle. A Journal Sentinel story in May also reached that conclusion. Voters are likely to hear that more precise claim as well in this election season. So consider that a bonus fact check. Our rating "Wisconsin has seen its best two-year job growth in a decade," the Walker campaign told reporters in late July and early August. Not true, we found: Private job growth was higher in 2010-11, in the final year of Doyle and the first year under Walker. And total employment including government jobs rose faster from 2003-05 and 2010-11 than in the two-year Walker period. We rate his claim False.

pomt-11390	"A lot" of Sen. Sherrod Brown’s policies "reflect that interest in Marxism" and a fondness for communism.	false	/ohio/statements/2018/mar/27/mike-gibbons/ohio-republican-wrongly-says-sherrod-brown-likes-c/	Republicans have long attacked U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, as an ultra liberal, but now one of Brown’s hopeful Republican challengers has cast the incumbent as someone who is so far to the left that he likes communism and Marxism. Mike Gibbons, a wealthy Ohio investment banker, criticized Brown’s philosophy in an interview Feb. 20 with the Republican Liberty Caucus of Ohio. Gibbons said that Brown "majored in Russian studies at Yale University and when he majored in it -- because he would have been in (the same year as) my class -- Russia was a communist country. So he studied communism, and apparently he liked it, because a lot of his policies reflect that interest in Marxism." Gibbons, who was the finance co-chair for a joint committee for Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee in 2016, has made comments about Brown studying Marxism or Russian multiple times on the campaign trail. He is one of many candidates, including U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, competing in the May 8 Republican primary. Gibbons’ claim is disingenuous. We found that Brown does speak up for American workers, as communists often do, but that doesn’t mean that Brown likes communism. In fact, for decades Brown has been critical of communism, particularly in China. Brown majored in Russian studies, then started political career Brown did receive a bachelor of arts in Russian and Eastern European studies from Yale in 1974. (Brown later earned master's degrees in education and public policy from Ohio State University. ) Brown’s Yale degree included courses in a broad range of disciplines, including studying the language, although Brown is not a fluent Russian speaker, his campaign spokesman Preston Maddock said. Maddock said Brown’s studies were not out of fondness for communism, and he pointed to several conservatives who also studied Russian or Russian studies, including former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham. In the 1970s, Russian studies was an important area of knowledge because people were developing expertise to help combat the USSR, a major Cold War opponent, said Mark Smith director of the Center for Political Studies at Cedarville University. "For sure, some in those programs may have been true believers in Marxism or communism, but there is no evidence of this in Brown's background," Smith said. "Nothing I am aware of would cause me to question his commitment to the United States, our form of government, or the Constitution (which he has sworn to uphold and defend)." The same year Brown graduated Yale in 1974, he won his first elected office to the Ohio House of Representatives. He later served as Ohio secretary of state and was elected to Congress in 1992. He joined the U.S. Senate in 2007. Gibbons cites Breitbart article Gibbons campaign’s main piece of evidence is a 2012 article in Breitbart, a conservative publication, which cited several examples linking Brown to "undue influence" from the Communist Party USA. Breitbart linked to a 2003 editorial written by Brown when he was in the House. Brown criticized Congress for taking many votes on important topics, such as veterans benefits, tax cuts and money for the Iraq war, between midnight and 3 a.m. "Always in the middle of the night," Brown wrote. "Always after the press had passed their deadlines. Always after the American people had turned off the news and gone to bed." There’s nothing about communism or Marxism in what Brown wrote, but Breitbart objected that it was re-printed by the People’s World, a publication that includes Marxist and communist opinions. But Brown’s op-ed was also published in mainstream publications such as the St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Lorain Morning Journal in Ohio. Breitbart also pointed to the People’s World celebrating Brown’s win in 2006; however, the editorial only briefly mentioned Brown and generally celebrated the national Democratic sweep when voters were mad about the war in Iraq. That fact that the People’s World supported Brown doesn’t show that Brown supported communism. Brown has a liberal record Brown is best known in the Senate for his longtime opposition to trade agreements and his support for labor, beginning when he was a freshman House member in 1993 and voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement. "Brown’s position on trade is rooted in fighting for American industry and workers and has been consistent throughout his career," Maddock, Brown’s spokesman, said. "If support for fair trade deals makes Senator Brown a communist, what does the Gibbons campaign have to say about the fact that Brown and President Trump frequently agree on how to deal with trade?" Brown has steadily earned high scores from the AFL-CIO as well as the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action and League of Conservation Voters. Despite his liberal record, he has found common ground with the Trump administration. Brown agreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He has said he will work with the Trump administration to help Ohio’s steel and manufacturing sectors, and in 2017 Brown praised Trump’s administration for asking the trade office to look into whether China had stolen U.S. technology and intellectual property University of Akron political science professor David B. Cohen noted the similarities on trade between Brown and Trump. "Brown’s position on trade is not much different than President Trump’s position, yet Gibbons is a huge public supporter of Trump. Are Trump’s economic views Marxian?" he said. Brown has criticized communism for decades Brown has spoken against communism for decades. After Brown lost the secretary of state re-election in 1990, he taught at Ohio State University and then worked with the Polish Ministry of Education to help rid its curriculum of Marxist-Leninist courses after the fall of the country's communist government in 1989, the Athens News reported in 2006. Brown has frequently criticized China for its communism and human rights abuses. In 1994, Brown criticized President Bill Clinton’s decision to renew Most Favored Nation trading status for China. "This is a communist country that has made some nods to free enterprise, but still has the same oppressive communist regime," Brown said. "It's almost nonsensical." In 2015, he opposed giving the Obama administration renewed Trade Promotion Authority known as "fast track." Our ruling In noting that Brown studied Russia as a college student, Gibbons said, "apparently he liked it, because a lot of his policies reflect that interest in Marxism." We found no evidence to suggest Brown supports Marxism or communism. Brown does favor American workers and opposes many free trade policies, but those are policy positions he shares with President Trump. We rate Gibbons’ statement False.

pomt-06697	Say Texas U.S. Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson and Sheila Jackson Lee are among open Socialists in Congress.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/sep/05/blog-posting/bloggers-say-two-texas-democrats-among-socialists-/	Texas Democratic U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston and Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas are both African-American members representing urban districts — and they’re among Socialists in Congress, blog posts say. The posts, which drew the attention of our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon, piggyback from a single offering replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks. It says there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives, including Johnson and Lee. (The number varies. Some posts say 70, while others insist it’s 73 or 76 or more.) An Aug. 12, 2011, post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United lists Johnson and Lee by name, along with others, saying too that it reflects 83 members of the "Progressive Caucus." It also says: "I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open (S)ocialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say — well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse." "This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one," says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. "The radical Marxist-progressives ([C]ommunists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago." In case anyone misses the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer-and-sickle emblem. Most names that politicians are called are opinions, beyond fact-checking, but our judgment is that calling a congressman a Socialist, as in a card-carrying member, can be fairly gauged. From a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth: "The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America.’ " Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And PolitiFact Oregon couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte. Some background: Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election. In this instance, some of the people on the list are no longer in office. In his post, Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as "card carrying" Socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida) and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii). His blog links to a list purported to have originated with the DSA, which says this: Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA? A: Seventy. It then lists them by name. A footnote credits the names to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers. A spokeswoman for Johnson, Dena Craig, declined to comment on the characterization, instead urging us to contact the caucus. "We stand behind the caucus," Craig said. We didn’t hear back from Lee. The Progressive Caucus, founded in 1991, says its members include a senator and 75 House Democrats, including Lee and Johnson. Its core principles are economic justice and security for all; civil rights and civil liberties; global peace and security; and environmental protection and energy independence. In an interview, Brad Bauman, its executive director, called "categorically false" blog posts indicating caucus members are Socialists. "It’s basically a slander against the caucus," he said. Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say the listed House members aren’t Socialists. The list that Cofall and dozens more rely on "is completely fraudulent," said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down in July. DSA supports some caucus policy positions, Llewellyn said, but no House members are DSA members. To join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, is not a member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Llewellyn aired chagrin for two reasons. First, the group has to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away. Second, Llewellyn said, "if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues. Llewellyn said similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since the caucus was created. "There’s nothing we can do to stop it," Llewellyn said. "I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it." The repeated claim about Lee, Johnson and other House members being Socialists shakes out as flagrantly incorrect. Pants on Fire!

pomt-02621	"Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy," the United States generates "more natural gas than anybody."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-we-generate-more-natural-gas-any/	During a recent radio address, President Barack Obama said the nation’s energy picture was robust. "Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from the rest of the world," Obama said on Jan. 18, 2014. "We generate more renewable energy than ever, and more natural gas than anybody." We’ve previously checked one of these claims. Earlier this month, we gave a True rating to Obama’s claim that "for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world." But we hadn’t fact-checked his claim that we generate "more natural gas than anybody." So we’ll check it here. We turned to two widely used sources for energy data. One is the Statistical Review of World Energy, published by petroleum giant BP. The other is the website of the Energy Information Administration, an office of the U.S. Department of Energy. According to BP’s data, United States natural gas production in 2012 was 619 million tons of oil equivalent, or 20.4 percent of the world. The only nation that came close to that was the Russian Federation, which produced 533 million tons of oil equivalent, or 17.6 percent of the world total. So by this measurement, Obama was correct. And the Energy Information Administration data concurs that the United States was No. 1 in the world. According to EIA -- which has figures as recent as 2011 -- the gross natural gas production by the United States was 28.5 trillion cubic feet, or 19.7 percent of the world total. The figure for Russia was 23.7 trillion cubic feet, or 16.4 percent of the world total. That said, there are still some issues to factor in. One is that there’s no guarantee that every country’s data is reliable, since not every nation has put the same effort into researching the question -- or, if they have, they may not be interested in sharing accurate information with economic rivals. While it would seem less likely that Russia would undercount its production than overcount it, it can’t be ruled out that, intentionally or unintentionally, the Russian figure for production is higher than these tables would suggest. The second issue is whether it’s justified for Obama to claim a share of the credit for the United States’ burst of natural gas production. It’s nothing new that the United States is at or near the top in natural gas production internationally. According to BP’s data, the United States and Russia have traded off the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in natural gas production ever since the data separated out the Russian Federation from the old Soviet Republics in 1985. Since 1985, the United States has outpaced the Russian Federation in 13 years: 1985, 1986, 1995, 1997 to 2002 and 2009 to 2012. During the same period, the Russian Federation outpaced the United States from 1987 to 1994, 1996 and 2003 to 2008. The United States’ lead over Russia has increased during Obama’s tenure. The United States produced 12 percent more natural gas than Russia in 2009, but 16 percent more than Russia in 2012. A big reason is the expansion of natural gas extracted from shale, using advanced technologies known as fracking. In some areas of the country, fracking has kicked off an economic boom, and measured by carbon emissions at the point of combustion, natural gas represents an improvement over oil or coal. But environmentalists argue that there are other downsides to fracking, from the risk of localized water contamination to higher carbon emissions when the entire drilling and transportation cycle is considered. We won’t referee this debate, but we will note that both advocates of drilling and environmentalists have criticized Obama, either for being too cautious about promoting natural gas development or being too eager to support it. When we looked at Obama’s campaign promise to expedite oil and gas drilling from domestic shale formations, we rated it a Compromise, noting that the numbers can be framed in ways that can either support or weaken the case that Obama has sped up the process of developing oil and natural gas resources. Obama did issue an executive order in 2012, titled, "Supporting Safe and Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic Natural Gas Resources" that established an interagency working group to "facilitate coordinated" federal efforts on new types of natural gas extraction. "While natural gas production is carried out by private firms, and states are the primary regulators of onshore oil and gas activities, the federal government has an important role to play by regulating oil and gas activities on public and Indian trust lands, encouraging greater use of natural gas in transportation, supporting research and development aimed at improving the safety of natural gas development and transportation activities, and setting sensible, cost-effective public health and environmental standards to implement federal law and augment state safeguards," the order said. Alan Krupnick, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy, said that the administration at the very least "has not interfered with the shale gas revolution, which I'd say is something. In my view, the Environmental Protection Agency has not been heavy-handed on environmental concerns" relating to natural gas. Still, as the administration acknowledged, the advances in shale-based natural gas extraction largely developed due to the private sector. And given the long-term pattern, it’s clear that natural gas production in the United States was already high before Obama took office. "Obama's claim, implied or voiced, rings hollow," said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future. "The shale gas fracking revolution, especially in its development phase, antedates Obama's presidency. And the bonanza it has created and the dramatic price declines it has spurred don't seem to me to be traceable to any of his administration's policies." Our ruling Obama said, "Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy," the United States generates "more natural gas than anybody." The best available data suggests that he’s right about the United States being No. 1 in the world in natural gas production, though it’s more in dispute whether his administration deserves credit (or, in the eyes of some environmentalists, blame) for "part" of this development, as Obama put it. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-01-22T15:37:58	2014-01-18	['United_States']
pomt-12631	About a third of Wisconsin’s high schools "are missing the mark of graduating young adults who are college ready," a "pass rate of 66.6%."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/30/lowell-holtz/candidate-says-wisconsin-deserved-d-grade-preparin/	Lowell Holtz says voters should revolt on April 4 and dismiss Tony Evers from the head of the class -- his position as Wisconsin’s state superintendent of public instruction. In a recent attack on learning outcomes in the Evers era, the conservative challenger noted that Evers’ declared mission is "Every Child a Graduate, College and Career Ready." But among high schools in Wisconsin, "roughly a third are missing the mark of graduating young adults who are college ready," Holtz wrote in a March 26, 2017 posting on his campaign web page. "That’s a pass rate of 66.6 percent, which equates to a D+ on my grading scale," he wrote. To back his claim, Holtz cited data on how many graduating high school students need remedial help when they enter the University of Wisconsin System. Typically that involves assistance with math, but sometimes with English. Under a 2015 state law, high schools have to provide that information to the state Legislature. Holtz correctly says in his post that 175 schools were identified in the 2015 version of the report. That’s 34% of the 510 public high schools in the state -- apparently the "roughly a third" he spoke of. There are private schools in that 175, however, so the proper denominator (using both public and private schools) is 575. That means 30 percent of schools made the list. So Holtz is slightly off. More significantly, there’s a false precision problem that hurts his claim. In reality, it’s impossible for the public to see exactly how many schools had students who needed help. That’s because, as Holtz noted, only schools where 7 or more students need such help must be publicly identified by the university system. It’s a privacy measure meant to protect the identify of individual students. So it’s very likely more schools would be on the list if the privacy provision did not exist. Making the grade Is making the list proof that these schools are "missing the mark" and not worthy of a passing grade on graduating "college-ready" students, as Holtz says? Holtz argues it is, citing Evers’ "Every Child a Graduate, College and Career Ready" mission statement. Even if just a few students need extra help, Holtz categorizes that as a failure. Tom McCarthy, a spokesman at the Evers-led Department of Public Instruction, says the slogan means the goal is college or a career for each student. Given the phrasing, it’s easy to see how one might interpret it as college for "every child," so Holtz’s rhetoric doesn’t strike us as out of bounds. More importantly, though, there is a major problem in characterizing the list. The report doesn’t rank the schools or characterize their outcomes as passing or failing -- yet Holtz lumps all the schools on the list into one failing category. The list includes every school that had at least 7 students who needed help, regardless of the size of the senior class and no consideration of how many -- or few -- of its graduates are in the state university system. So the list includes many schools where you can count on two hands the number of students who needed remedial assistance. For instance, Brookfield East had 10 students who needed math help, landing it on Holt’s failure list, despite the fact the number represents just 7.7 percent of the school’s 130 UW-bound pupils. At the same time, the list includes a few schools where the rate is over 70 percent. (On average, it was 40 percent for math across all the listed schools). Many of the schools with higher rates have very few students going to the UW system. For example, Johnson Creek High School was listed as 80 percent needing math help -- or 8 of 10. Who is ready? Another factor in checking Holtz’s claim is how to define "college ready." Holtz says the need for remedial help is enough to show the students were not ready. But the students already were accepted into college. The need for any remedial help is established in placement tests after their acceptance. The rating About a third of Wisconsin’s high schools "are missing the mark of graduating young adults who are college ready," Lowell Holtz claimed, a "pass rate of 66.6 percent." Holtz cites legitimate data and makes fair use of Evers’ own words to judge the incumbent’s record. But the limits of the data, and Holtz’s blanket characterization of 175 schools as failing on preparing students for college, create significant misperceptions. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-08097	Under the compromise tax agreement, "99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/14/bernie-sanders/sen-bernie-sanders-says-997-american-families-woul/	While the debate over the compromise tax agreement proposed by President Barack Obama has focused mostly on Bush's income tax cuts and whether they ought to be extended to wealthy Americans, the issue of estate taxes has also become a sticking point for some legislators. Under the plan, the estate tax rate would be set at 35 percent, with an effective exemption of $5 million. Many Republicans had hoped to do away with the estate tax altogether, and Democrats last year had proposed a higher rate: 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. The compromise has ruffled feathers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., for example, said he would not support the plan because he considered the estate tax compromise a tax increase. We ruled that claim Barely True. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a self-described democratic socialist, sent out a message via Twitter on Dec. 13, 2010, saying that under the estate tax plan, "99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on the rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich." According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Sanders is correct. The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 99.7 percent of estates were exempt from the estate tax in 2009 when the first $3.5 million of an estate was exempt. Even fewer people would be subject to the tax if the threshold is increased to $5 million, as proposed in the compromise tax plan. Under the compromise plan, less than 2/10 of 1 percent of estates would be subject to the estate tax next year, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. That means more than 99.8 percent would be completely exempt. The Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3,600 estates would be subject to the tax under the $5 million threshold. Those 3,600 estates would have to pay an estimated $11.4 billion in estate taxes under the compromise tax plan. Estate tax rates have fluctuated through modern history. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same time increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax disappeared altogether in 2010. But the Bush plan only had a 10-year window because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. Barring a new tax agreement, the rate was set to revert next year to a 55 percent rate with an effective exemption of $1 million. Last year, Democrats proposed a plan to permanently set the estate tax rate at 2009 levels -- 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Had that plan gone through, the Tax Policy Center estimates it would have subjected 6,460 estates to a tax (bring in an estimated $18.2 billion). If no tax plan passes, and the rate goes back to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million, an 43,540 estates would have to pay (bringing in an estimated $34.4 billion next year). Sanders was correct that in 2009, when the effective exemption was $3.5 million, about 99.7 percent of all estates were exempt and didn't pay anything. The compromise plan -- which would set effective exemption at $5 million -- would push the number of exempted estates even higher, so that more than 99.8 percent of estates would not pay anything. We rate Sanders' comment True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2010-12-14T13:49:04	2010-12-13	['United_States']
pomt-11146	"Property and income taxes will be lower in 2018 than they were in 2010."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/30/scott-walker/caveats-scott-walker-right-income-and-property-tax/	One of the favorite boasts of Republican Gov. Scott Walker -- and one he’s sure to repeat as he runs for a third term in November 2018 -- is how much he has cut taxes. In an online re-election ad released April 17, 2018, Walker claimed a number of tax-cut accomplishments, including this one: "Property and income taxes will be lower in 2018 than they were in 2010." Are they? The answer: Yes, with some caveats. In a nutshell, total property and income tax collections are higher now than they were. But that’s partly because of growth, such as property taxes based on new construction, and income taxes paid by more people being in the workforce. On the other hand, when you consider a typical taxpayer -- the property tax bill on a median home and income tax rates across the board -- the two taxes are lower in 2018 than 2010. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Property taxes To evaluate the first part of Walker’s claim, we’ll rely in part on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks 86 previous campaign promises made by Walker over his previous two campaigns. When running for a second term in 2014, Walker promised to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010. When we rated that pledge in November 2017, we gave Walker a Promise Kept, based on figures from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. We followed up with the fiscal bureau and were given these figures for the property tax on a median-value home: 2010 2018 Difference $2,963 $2,875 -$88 Fiscal Bureau director Bob Lang told us that the median-value figure is what his agency provides in evaluating state budget bills, so it’s a typical measure. Median figures are also what Walker’s campaign relied on to back up the propery tax part of Walker’s claim. Two tax experts from nonpartisan organizations -- Jason Stein, research director at the Wisconsin Policy Forum and Dale Knapp, who was research director at the former Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance -- agreed that the median is a common measure for how property taxes have changed. But they pointed out that tax bills for properties can vary widely around the state, due to differences in property values, tax rates and other factors. In other words, not everyone’s property tax bill is lower. It’s worth noting that critics have said that under Walker, funding has been reduced for the state homestead tax credit, which was designed to provide property tax relief to low-income homeowners and renters. The nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project estimates that as a result of the most recent reduction, done in the 2017-’19 state budget, about 11,400 households will see property tax increases averaging $614 per year. The Wisconsin Democratic Party pointed to a recent rise in school referendums adopted by voters in school districts around the state, arguing the referendums are being forced because of reductions in state funding. The Walk-O-Meter Here’s a breakdown of our ratings on 88 campaign promises made by Scott Walker during his first two campaigns for governor. Promise Kept -- 53.5 percent Promise Broken -- 20.9 percent Compromise -- 12.8 percent In the Works -- 7 percent Stalled -- 5.8 percent Income taxes Both Stein and Knapp said changes in income taxes are more difficult to measure for a typical taxpayer because there are more variables -- such as how many exemptions or tax credits a taxpayer qualifies for, whether the taxpayers is single or married, owns a home, has children at home, etc. But they said one reasonable measure is income tax rates, especially given that’s where Walker has made major changes. Tax rates are what Walker’s campaign cited to back up the second part of Walker’s claim. We went to the fiscal bureau again and Lang confirmed that the tax rates in each income bracket are lower than they were in 2010. For people filing as single, married/jointly and married/separately, there were five rates in 2010, starting with the lowest level of taxable income and going up: 4.6 percent 6.15 percent 6.5 percent 6.75 percent 7.75 percent In 2018, there are only four: 4 percent 5.84 percent 6.27 percent 7.65 percent Jon Peacock, director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, told us it’s important to note that some low-income parents are paying higher income taxes because of cuts to the earned income tax credit. For families with three or more children who get the maximum credit, for example, a change Walker initiated in 2011 will cost them $579 in 2018, he said. The Democratic Party pointed out that a manufacturing and agricultural tax credit, worth more than $1 billion according to the fiscal bureau, primarily benefits corporations and high-income earners. Our rating Walker says: "Property and income taxes will be lower in 2018 than they were in 2010." Total property and income tax collections are higher in 2018 than they were in 2010, partly because of new properties paying taxes and more workers paying income taxes. But using two reasonable measures at the individual level, the property tax on a typical home is lower in 2018 and than it was in 2010; and across the board, income tax rates are lower in 2018 than in 2010. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2018-05-30T06:00:00	2018-04-17	['None']
pomt-08416	As state treasurer, Alexi Giannoulias "lost $73 million in our kids’ college savings."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/20/mark-kirk/mark-kirk-campaign-ads-saya-alexi-giannoulias-lost/	The latest attack ad in the Illinois Senate race beats a well-worn path. Republican Congressman Mark Kirk accuses Democratic opponent Alexi Giannoulias of lending money to mobsters when he was a senior loan officer at his family's now-defunct bank and brands Giannoulias as a tax-and-spend liberal. It also accuses Giannoulias of mismanaging oversight of a college savings program as state treasurer. Here's the text of the ad, which is titled "You must be kidding": What do you call someone who lent $20 million to convicted felons and mobsters? Senior Loan Officer… Alexi Giannoulias. What do you call a man who lost $73 million in our kids’ college savings? State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias. What do you call someone who wants the government to spend more, and raise your taxes to pay for it? Senator Alexi Giannoulias? You must be kidding. Again, these accusations are nothing new. In June, PolitiFact looked into a Kirk ad that claimed, "At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed." We rated that claim Half True. The loans-to-mobsters claim is slightly different this time around, but we think you'll get the gist of things if you read that previous PolitiFact item. In this item, we'll explore the claim that as state treasurer, Giannoulias "lost $73 million in our kids’ college savings." When he was running to be Illinois state treasurer, Giannoulias promised to revitalize the state's 529 college savings plan, called Bright Start. But a year after taking office in 2007, one of the funds in the program -- one that was supposed to be relatively conservative -- took a nosedive, losing more than 35 percent of its value. The bond market took a beating in 2008 with the collapse of the housing market. Lots of people lost a lot of money on investments. But the fund in question did much worse than its peers. That the fund lost big is undisputed, but what's murkier is whether it's fair to tag Giannoulias with responsibility for some, all, or any, of those losses. First, a bit of background and context. The fund in question here is the Core Plus Fixed Income Strategy Fund, a fund managed by OppenheimerFunds Inc. that was supposed to provide a conservative investment option for parents whose children were close to college age. The fund represented about 15 percent of the money invested in Bright Start. In April 2009, Morningstar, an investment research firm, called OppenheimerFunds "the poster child for how badly some 529 players went awry in 2008." The Core Plus fund "lost more than 35 percent in 2008 due to management's bets on nonagency mortgages. In particular, management gained exposure to the battered commercial mortgage-backed securities market through derivatives that had a leveraging effect on the fund, amplifying losses," according to the Morningstar report. Nonagency mortgages are mortgages that are not backed by the government. Giannoulias has consistently blamed Oppenheimer managers for the losses -- as did Kirk back in October 2009. But an Oct. 13, 2010, Chicago Tribune story by reporters Jeff Coen and Todd Lightly raises new questions about Giannoulias' culpability. According to the story, "Documents and e-mails recently obtained by the Tribune under the state's open records law show the rookie treasurer and his staff were concerned early on about the aggressive move by OppenheimerFunds Inc. in what was supposed to be a more conservative fund in the Bright Start program. "But at each turn Giannoulias stuck with the firm's strategy, even as the housing market soured and losses accelerated," the article said. In an interview with the Tribune, Giannoulias "reiterated that he was one of the first officials to confront Oppenheimer about the losses. He said he stayed the course based on advice from Oppenheimer managers, his own staff and an outside financial consultant." Financial analysts interviewed for the story noted that the "volatility of the market in 2008 caught many financial professionals off-guard" and that, among the many states with similar funds managed by Oppenheimer, "none reacted faster than Illinois." Together with the state attorney general, Giannoulias' office helped get a $77 million settlement from Oppenheimer -- recovering about half the estimated $150 million in losses suffered by the fund. And in December 2008, Giannoulias' office directed all new contributions to the fund to U.S. Treasury bonds. By then, the Tribune story notes, "Core Plus had lost 38 percent of its value for the year. Over the same period, other funds of its type showed about a 5 percent return." In his interview with the Tribune, Giannoulias said, "It breaks my heart to hear that people have lost money in any fund. But what took place with the markets was devastating to a lot of individuals and a lot of businesses." Giannoulias' campaign further notes that in June, Kiplinger's named Bright Start among the top five college savings programs in the country, praising the index portfolios of mostly Vanguard funds for charging "rock bottom fees." Again, there's no dispute that the Core Plus fund lost $73 million, which likely caused a great hardship for many parents whose children were just about to enter college. And as state treasurer, it was Giannoulias' job to oversee the Bright Start program. It's less clear, though, that it's accurate to claim Giannoulias lost that money. Yes, the Tribune story suggests Giannoulias had concerns early on about the aggressive investment strategy in the fund -- but that he opted to stick with the firm's strategy on the advice of Oppenheimer managers and an outside consultant. But analysts also credited Illinois with reacting more quickly to the issues than other states, and Giannoulias helped get a settlement with Oppenheimer to recoup half the losses. There's a lot of context to consider here on both sides of the equation. Having done that, we rate the ad's claim Half True.	None	Mark Kirk	None	None	None	2010-10-20T10:44:08	2010-10-18	['None']
pomt-01969	A record number of immigrants not from Mexico are "being apprehended at the border."	true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-correct-record-number-immigrants-not-me/	Questioning the flow of unaccompanied Central American children across the Texas-Mexico border, Gov. Rick Perry declared he has yet to hear from President Barack Obama or his administration to a 2012 letter urging attention to the matter. Perry went on to say on "Fox & Friends" June 17, 2014: "We have record-high numbers of ‘other than Mexicans’ being apprehended at the border. These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." Both of those claims drew our interest, though for this story, we’re tackling only Perry’s statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. We’ll check his reference to people coming from "states like Syria" in another article. The increased flow of children from Central American nations has attracted attention, in part, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor, suggested this month, because fewer Mexicans are being detained near the border than any year since 1971. An online U.S. Border Patrol chart shows about 265,000 Mexicans were caught near the border in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That was up 3,000 from the year before, according to the chart, but down at least 15,000 compared to any of the previous dozen years. News reports suggest multiple factors in this surge including a contrast: The Border Patrol routinely and quickly returns immigrants from Mexico across the Rio Grande; that's not an option for handling individuals from distant countries like El Salvador and Honduras. So, have non-Mexican detentions at the border reached a record level? To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry drew his conclusion about a record being set from information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. We turned to the Border Patrol for numbers. The federal agency posted an online chart indicating its officers apprehended 153,055 people from countries "other than Mexico" in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That’s more than in any of the seven previous years. That chart shows, though, that 165,170 "other than Mexicans" were apprehended in fiscal 2005. The numbers include all Border Patrol regions, including the northern border with Canada and coastal boundaries. Every year, though, the vast majority of such apprehensions occur in the agency’s Southwest Border region, running from San Diego to the tip of Texas. And what about the South Texas portions of the border that have received attention recently? The chart shows nearly 115,000 apprehensions from countries other than Mexico in the agency’s Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in fiscal 2013, which outpaced the previous high of 100,647 in fiscal 2005. Tighter focus: The 96,829 "other than Mexico" apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector in 2013 was 21 percent greater than the sector’s previous high (at least since fiscal 2000) of 79,854 such apprehensions in 2005. By telephone, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, brought us up to speed on "other than Mexico" apprehensions from October 2013 through May 2014, or the first eight months of fiscal 2014. In that period, he said, there were 165,729 such apprehensions nationally, including 162,749 in the Southwest region, counting what would be a 15-year high of 122,071 (and counting) in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Separately, analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank focused on reduced immigration, emailed us its chart demonstrating a surge since early 2011 in "other than Mexico" apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector: We asked Smith if for history’s sake, we should try to gauge apprehensions before 2000, the earliest year on the Border Patrol’s chart. Smith said there weren’t more such apprehensions any year before 2000. Our own brief look for older data led us to a Sept. 22, 2005, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service indicating fewer people from countries other than Mexico were apprehended in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Finally: The number of unaccompanied children being picked up also has been record-setting, according to a June 4, 2014, New York Times news story. "Since Oct. 1, a record 47,017 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwest United States border," the story said, "most traveling from Central America, part of a larger wave that includes some youngsters accompanied by their parents and some traveling alone." The story said that according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that 47,017 total is "nearly twice as high as all of the last fiscal year (24,493 apprehensions), with four months yet to go in the current fiscal year." And, a June 5, 2014, Times news story said, an internal draft Homeland Security document projects unaccompanied-minor apprehensions rising to 90,000 in the current fiscal year, running through September 2014. Peter Boogaard, a Homeland Security spokesman, told the paper the draft document was not official policy and had not been finalized or circulated. Our ruling Perry said a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are "being apprehended at the border." We didn’t come up with apprehension figures for every year through history. But available figures show the Border Patrol apprehended more people from countries other than Mexico along the border through the first eight months of fiscal 2014 than it apprehended in any of the preceding 17 years. We rate Perry's statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-03936	Says Chuck Hagel’s nomination as defense secretary "has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/feb/21/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-hagel-nomination-publicly-celebrated/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who opposes the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as U.S. Secretary of Defense, rat-a-tatted his qualms in a February opinion column posted by Politico. The freshman Texas Republican said Hagel, whose nomination was announced by President Barack Obama on Jan. 7, 2013, had lately shifted his positions on cracking down on state sponsors of terrorism, the use of any means to prevent a nuclear Iran and his antagonism to the U.S. alliance with Israel. Also, Cruz wrote, "Hagel’s nomination has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government — surely an occurrence without precedent for a nominee for secretary of Defense." If there was a Hagel hoedown in Tehran, it didn’t make front-page news here. So, we wanted to know more about Cruz’s charge. Cruz’s office pointed us to a Jan. 8, 2013, Reuters news account stating that a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry had responded to a question about Hagel’s views on Israel and U.S. sanctions on Iran. By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier also noted that CBS News headlined its post of the Reuters story: "Hagel nomination cheers Iran, worries Israel" and the New York Times headlined the story: "Iran: Foreign Ministry Voices Optimism in Hagel Nomination in U.S." The Reuters story opens: "Iran's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it hoped the appointment of Chuck Hagel as the next U.S. defense secretary would lead to ‘practical changes’ in Washington's foreign policy." "Iran and the U.S., adversaries for more than three decades, are at odds over many issues, including the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme, which Western countries say is aimed at forging a nuclear arms capability," the story continues. "Tehran denies this." At a weekly press conference, the story says, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Ramin Mehmanparast, said: "We hope there will be practical changes in American foreign policy and that Washington becomes respectful of the rights of nations." The comment was initially reported by Iran's IRIB news website, Reuters said, and the official "was answering a question about Hagel's views on Israel and U.S. sanctions on Iran." The story says, too, that the spokesman did not elaborate. However, with help from University of Texas professor Jason Brownlee, we found a more detailed account as posted by Iran’s semiofficial news organization, the Fars News Agency. The Fars account further quotes the spokesman, identified there as Ramin Mehman-Parast, as saying: "We hope that the U.S. officials will favor peace instead of warmongering and recognize the rights of nations instead of interfering in the countries’ internal affairs. If such a trend is adopted (by the American officials)," the Fars story quotes the spokesman as saying, "hatred for the U.S. hostile policies will decrease, although," he is quoted as saying, that assessment only "can be made in action." We identified no other news stories on Iran commenting on the nomination and found only one expert who drew substantive meaning from the quoted comments. Steven Bucci, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said by phone that it’s reasonable to conclude the spokesman’s comment reflects Iran’s position that Hagel’s selection could signal fresh U.S. respect. "That’s sort of their way of saying this guy will treat us correctly as opposed to the way the rest of you have been treating us. I think that’s pretty clear," Bucci said. "That comment shows they hope that Mr. Hagel comes in with a different manner and viewpoint." Bucci said, though, that he would not interpret the spokesman’s statements as a government celebration, which he called "a little bit of an overstatement." (To our follow-up query, Bucci said by email that the foundation considers Hagel unqualified to be the secretary.) Other experts said they were unaware of Iran’s government celebrating the nomination. Scott Bates, president of the Center for National Policy, which says it connects senior policy makers with innovative thinking and research on issues affecting U.S. security, said by phone that the Iranian spokesman hardly represents the top tier of the government and his comment seems "very thin gruel." More broadly, Bates said, "Iran is far from transparent in their dealings with the international community. I’d take with a grain of salt anything to come out of the Iranian regime." Syracuse University political scientist Mehrzad Boroujerdi, an Iran expert, emailed that he sees nothing in the Reuters story to signal government celebration. "There is nothing in that language that conveys enthusiasm for Hagel’s appointment," Boroujerdi said. "Please keep in mind that Obama has been in office for more than 4 years and if there was any optimism it occurred 4 years ago with a new administration and not now with a candidate for Defense Secretary." Iran expert Trita Parsi, founder and president of the National Iranian American Council, has saluted Obama’s choice of Hagel. By email, Parsi called the ministry spokesman’s comment a standard phrase from Iran’s government which would have had nothing to do with Hagel. Parsi added that to the best of his knowledge, there has been no welcoming of Hagel by Iran, which would be extremely unusual "since Iranian officials rarely say anything positive about American politicians." "Moreover," Parsi wrote, "the view in Tehran tends to be that individuals in the U.S. system do not matter that much--including the president. Structural factors are too strong for them to have a decisive impact." John Limbert, a former ambassador who had Foreign Service tours in Algeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, where he was among more than 50 American hostages held for 14 months starting in November 1979, similarly said the quoted official’s comment was "basically restating a longheld Iranian position," which is "the U.S. has to show us more," perhaps by easing economic sanctions. "Celebrating" as a description, Limbert said, "is very, very misleading." Separately, Alex Vatanka, who focuses on Iran for the Washington-based Middle East Institute, searched Farsi-language news sites at our request. He emailed: "There is no sign of the Iranian regime officially expressing happiness about the nomination... In fact, there is surprisingly little sign of a coverage of this issue by Iran’s state-run media." Our ruling Cruz said the Hagel nomination "has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government." An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman expressed hope that with Hagel as secretary, Washington would become "respectful of the rights of nations" and if so, he said, Iran’s hatred of U.S. policies will decrease. Experts differ on the significance of those comments. But they concur that the response fell short of a governmental celebration, with most saying it was far from it. Our sense is there has been no Hagel party in Iran, leaving this claim worse than incorrect. It’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2013-02-21T06:00:00	2013-02-01	['Iran']

pomt-13120	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2016/nov/03/donald-trump/trump-no-marksman-when-aiming-chicago-gun-laws/	When professing his belief in protecting the Second Amendment, Donald Trump often has invoked Chicago as a place that proves gun regulation does not equate with reduced gun crime. He’s been making this claim longer than he’s been a candidate for president: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In his final debate with Hillary Clinton on Oct. 19, Trump repeated this statement: "In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city." For Chicago, 2016 has been a year of record gun violence. The pre-Halloween weekend was the deadliest of the year, with 17 people killed. "There have been at least 638 homicides so far this year, 217 more than this time last year, the data show. At least 3,662 people have been shot in the city, 1,106 more than during the same period last year," the Chicago Tribune reported on Oct. 31. As of Aug. 30, Chicago had more homicides and shootings than New York and Los Angeles combined. But does Chicago really have what Trump calls "the toughest gun laws in the United States?" The Trump campaign didn’t respond to requests for documentation. So to find out, we’ll look at "gun laws" from two angles, possession and sentencing of gun offenders. Possession For two years, Chicago did have the toughest gun possession law in the country. In 1982, the city banned possession of handguns by civilians, joining Washington, D.C., in prohibiting handgun possession. But the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2008 District of Columbia vs. Heller decision ruled the D.C. law unconstitutional, making Chicago the lone holdout among major cities for handgun prohibition. (A handful of Chicago suburbs had enacted bans along with Chicago’s.) But the Heller decision paved the way for the 2010 McDonald vs. City of Chicago decision that extended the Heller decision -- which had overturned a law specific to the District of Columbia -- to states. That meant Chicago no longer could ban handgun possession. Chicagoans, however, still faced stricter gun laws than residents of other major cities because Illinois was alone among states in not allowing concealed carry of firearms. Illinois became the last state in the nation to adopt concealed carry in July 2013, eight months after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s ban on concealed carry was unconstitutional. With that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities. Illinois’ gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its "Smart Gun Laws" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners’ ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases. But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are. Violations Another way to interpret Trump’s statement is that Chicago’s gun laws are strict because they impose strict penalties on those who violate them. But here, too, Illinois falls short -- much to the chagrin of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel has argued for years that sentencing guidelines for gun offenders in Illinois are too lenient. The Chicago street gang members who have propelled the city to the top of the gun violence list, Emanuel has said, face harsher punishment from their gang leaders for losing a gun than for getting arrested with one. "Let me remind you what one admitted gangbanger said in 2012 to a reporter. This is what the gangbanger said: that his gun possession arrest was a joke. Gangbangers know how to manipulate the criminal justice system, and they know its weaknesses first-hand," Emanuel said in a major speech Sept. 22 to address public safety in the city amid public furor over the Laquan McDonald shooting. "Our criminal justice system is fractured, and it is undermining Chicago’s neighborhoods." A Chicago Sun-Times analysis a year earlier had found that gun sentences for Chicago offenders were more lenient than elsewhere: In Chicago, felons illegally possessing a gun typically get four years, the Sun-Times found — toward the low end of the state sentencing guidelines. And those are the sentences judges hand out, not the actual prison time. Most people convicted of these gun crimes serve less than half of their prison terms because of "good time" that inmates can get credit for under state law, in addition to credit for time held in the Cook County Jail while awaiting trial. New York, by comparison, has a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 3 1/2 years for simple gun possession. In 2013, Emanuel pushed unsuccessfully for the Illinois General Assembly to impose mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes. The effort was blocked by lawmakers concerned that it would lead to increased incarceration of young blacks and Latinos. Our ruling Donald Trump said, "In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city." Chicago once had very tough regulations against guns, but they’ve been considerably watered down after the Supreme Court ruled that cities can’t ban handguns. Additionally, the state at one time didn’t allow concealed carry, and now it does. Its rules for allowing concealed carry are more relaxed than in California or New York -- states that allow local jurisdictions to regulate concealed carry within their boundaries. Nor are penalties for violating gun laws in Illinois the toughest in the United States. Mandatory minimum sentences make New York state’s laws tougher than those in Illinois. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth -- Chicago leads the nation for number of gun-related crimes this year -- but it ignores the fact that a U.S. Supreme Court decision and a change in state law brought Chicago in line with other cities on handgun rules.

pomt-15288	The Texas Capitol faces South toward Goliad, in memory of the most horrific battle of the Texas Revolution.	false	/texas/statements/2015/jul/24/christine-gilbert/letter-writer-says-texas-capitol-built-facing-sout/	Amid debate about Confederate flags, statues and like symbols, artist Christine Gilbert of Austin drew our attention by spreading the word about a claim on a state web page that the Texas Capitol faces south to honor a revolutionary conflict. Gilbert wrote a letter to the editor of the Austin American-Statesman about the pink-granite Texas Capitol, planted in downtown Austin at the top of Congress Avenue north of the Colorado River. The letter, published July 11, 2015, opened by mentioning reader Jim Challstrom’s earlier letter saying he’d told Uber passengers that the Capitol (which opened in 1888) faces south "to snub the Union." In early 1861, after all, Texas had joined the rebellious Confederate States of America. Gilbert said she wondered if Challstrom was right, noting in her letter that the Capitol "was built" starting "in 1885." Also, she wrote, the "previous Capitol was built in 1853 and also faced south," her point being that this construction occurred before the Civil War. Then Gilbert's letter quoted a statement on a Texas Senate web page: "The Texas Capitol building faces South toward Goliad, in memory of the most horrific battle of the Texas Revolution. ‘Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!’ were cries that were heard in 1836." Gilbert made us wonder afresh. Is Goliad, site of the infamous massacre of Texas soldiers about 130 miles southeast of Austin, why the Capitol faces south? A Texas Senate website A few days after Gilbert’s letter appeared, we clicked to the cited Senate web page, titled "Capitol Images," and noticed 14 statements about the Capitol including the Goliad entry alongside photos from the archives of Senate Media Services: There were two major revolutionary turns in Goliad—an 1835 battle won by the Texians (pointed out to us by a reader after we initially posted this fact check) and a nearby battle of the Coleto in March 1836 where Col. James Fannin and his men were surrounded and forced to surrender. "The Texans were imprisoned by the Mexicans at Goliad and subsequently murdered by order of Antonio López de Santa Anna" with Fannin shot separately, according to an account by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. About a month later, Sam Houston led forces to victory at San Jacinto in the rout that brought Texas its independence by treaty in May 1836. Next, we contacted the secretary of the Texas Senate, Patsy Spaw, who told us by phone she didn’t know the basis of the Goliad reference on the Senate web page. "I’m not certain we can say anything definitely about why the Capitol faces south, but the more likely reason," Spaw speculated by email, "is that it was built to face the town and the river." Historical resources We also ventured to the Legislative Reference Library and perused the ninth (2010) edition of a publication from the Texas Legislative Council, "A History of the Lone Star Statehouse," which said the current Capitol was preceded by a one-story building a few blocks south and before that, just south of the current location, the three-story Old Stone Capitol, which was destroyed in an 1881 fire. That publication did not speak to why the Renaissance Revival-style Capitol that’s still in place faces south. We also reached the State Preservation Board, which maintains the Capitol, whose staff spokesman, Chris Currens, said by phone the agency has no records connecting the Capitol’s alignment and Goliad. Currens added that he believes the Capitol was built to face the heart of the city including its main business thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, in keeping with surveyor Edwin Waller’s plan for the city (see below) showing a Capitol Square in a prominent place on a rise north of the river. Waller's plan for Austin In 1839, according to the Handbook of Texas, Mirabeau Lamar, president of the young Republic of Texas, chose Waller to supervise the surveying and sale of town lots and the construction of public buildings at the new capital at Austin. Waller did so and also was elected Austin's first mayor in 1840. SOURCE: Austin History Center (received by email from Chris Currens, director of special projects, State Preservation Board, July 15, 2015) Currens emailed us a page from a December 1989 report on the preservation board's master plan, which said: "When Waller laid out the city of Austin between the river and two creeks (now Waller and Shoal), he situated his imaginary Capitol building at the high northern end of a grand avenue stretching 10 blocks from the river. His so-called Capitol Square, roughly the size of four city blocks, held the most prominent point in the plan, and Waller’s vision of the building was no doubt one of grandeur." A 1932 thesis and a 2013 book Our search for insight on this claim led next to the Austin History Center where we read a 1932 master’s degree thesis on the building of the Capitol by Joubert Lee Greer. Greer noted that legislators who set the construction in motion specified in 1879 that it be located on the Capitol grounds. Later, the architectural plans developed by E.E. Myers of Detroit made it clear which way the main entrance would face. Greer wrote: "The building was shown in the form of a Greek Cross, with the main entrance of the building fronting the south." The thesis did not specify why. Meantime, Spaw advised by email that additional research by her office had yielded no sign of a Goliad element to the Capitol facing south. She pointed out that a 2013 book, "Seat of Empire: The Embattled Birth of Austin, Texas," by Jeffrey S. Kerr of Austin, says Waller originally planned for the Capitol to be in the center of Austin "grid" that he drew south of the present-day Capitol but that when he arrived at the intended site, he decided the "topography called for situating the public buildings on high ground to the rear so as to overlook the river." Spaw added: "Of course, the current Capitol wasn’t built until much later but this indicates that the plan all along was to have the Capitol face the river." Kerr also wrote that Waller "quickly recognized the advantage of placing the permanent capitol to the rear of the city overlooking the sloping plains leading down to the river." Reached by email, Kerr told us he’d never heard the Capitol was built to face Goliad. Facing the Capitol north would have turned it away from town, Kerr wrote. "When it was designed in the 1880s most of the city (certainly the business part of town and government buildings) still lay toward the river." He added: "I cannot state that honoring Goliad was not a consideration; I've just never seen that mentioned anywhere." Former Sen. Terrell's Goliad mention Like us, Spaw separately reached out to the state library where researchers unearthed a newspaper story from the 1880s quoting a former officeholder mentioning Goliad in a speech during ceremonies dedicating the new Capitol. Alexander Terrell, who as a state senator had carried legislation authorizing the sale of state-owned lands to fund the Capitol’s construction, recalled that after Austin became the capital, Texans came "and erected a rude state house for the republic." Urging celebrants to remember those who sacrificed their lives in the Texas Revolution, Terrell then mentioned Goliad, saying: "This stately edifice typifies in its strength and fair proportions the unity of a mighty state. On its lofty dome you behold the statue of Liberty, holding up in her hand a single star to blaze amid its sister constellations, fit emblem of the aspirations, the grandeur and the unity of Texas. It rose above the massacre at Goliad to typify redemption. Its lustre is for all the land from the Red river to the Rio Grande, and from New Mexico to the gulf, and for a people who will preserve this state one and indivisible forever." By email, Spaw agreed this Goliad mention did not demonstrate the Capitol was built to face that site. She also said that she'd ordered the declaration at issue removed from the Senate’s website. The Goliad claim isn’t substantiated, Spaw said. Our ruling Quoting a snippet on a Senate website, Gilbert said the Texas Capitol faces south toward Goliad in memory of a key battle in the Texas Revolution. We found no factual foundation to that; the Goliad claim also was removed from the site a few days after we launched our inquiries. Besides, we conclude, the Capitol faces south so lawmakers can perennially keep an eye on the Austin American-Statesman, located on the south bank of the Colorado River. Just kidding! The historical consensus is that in keeping with Waller's Austin vision, the Capitol was built, on a gentle rise at the top of the city’s main street, to face south toward the capital’s heart.

abbc-00008	Australians now need to visit a doctor to obtain codeine after the drug was taken off pharmacy shelves and made available only with a prescription.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-23/fact-check-over-the-counter-prescription-only-codeine/9522916	Mr Hunt's claim doesn't stack up. There has not been any recent data to suggest that 100 Australians are dying every year from over-the-counter codeine products. The latest available data was published in a 2015 study covering 2000 to 2013, which showed that on average about 100 Australians were dying a year from all codeine products, both over-the-counter and prescription. Mr Hunt's claim comes from a Therapeutic Goods Administration estimate, which is based on an assumption that an increasing death rate seen in the early years of that research would have continued in the time since then. This is not accepted by experts consulted by Fact Check. In any case the study was unable to determine the source of the codeine involved in 60 per cent of the deaths. In the 40 per cent where the source could be determined, over-the-counter products were involved in 40 per cent of cases. That means over-the-counter codeine was only conclusively found in 16 per cent of all the deaths reported in the study, or 16 per year on average. It appears that Mr Hunt and the Therapeutic Goods Administration have used the study's findings to assume that over-the-counter products were involved in 40 per cent of all codeine-related deaths. However, the authors of the study cautioned against that, saying that an absence of data "limits inferences about the source of codeine". In the lead-up to the decision to make codeine prescription-only, the Therapeutic Goods Administration commissioned an economic model from KPMG. KPMG used the data from the 2015 study to arrive at an assumption that there could currently be 30 deaths per year from over-the-counter codeine. The 2015 study also pointed out that making codeine available only on prescription would not prevent all the deaths attributable to over-the-counter codeine. Using the reasons given in the study, KPMG's model assumed that five lives a year would be saved by the move, which it described as a conservative number suitable for assessing the costs and benefits of banning over-the-counter sales. While there is evidence of an overall increase in misuse and harm relating to codeine products, the available research does not support Mr Hunt's claim that 100 lives a year could be saved by making codeine available only on prescription.

pomt-08355	Roy Barnes voted against a bill in the state Senate that would have made it easier to convict child abusers.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/27/nathan-deal/deal-said-barnes-opposed-bill-against-child-abuser/	This year's gubernatorial rivals are spending the campaign's precious last days accusing each other of abetting evildoers. Democrat Roy Barnes said in a TV commercial that in 1991, Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal fought to weaken laws that protect rape victims. We ruled the accusation Half True. In response, Deal fired off a press release that said in 1995,Barnes opposed a bill that would have helped put child abusers behind bars. The release, "Barnes ads tell despicable lies," said "Barnes voted against a bill in the state Senate that would have made it easier to gain convictions in child abuse cases." Election Day is Tuesday, when Barnes and Deal face off against Libertarian John Monds. So, did Barnes side with villains? Deal spokesman Brian Robinson pointed to failed state Senate Bill 124, which would have allowed types of hearsay evidence to be used during trial in cases of child "sexual conduct or physical abuse." Barnes spokesman Emil Runge said his candidate opposed the bill in 1995 because he thought it was unconstitutional. Barnes was in the state House of Representatives when it came up for vote. Deal was serving in the U.S. Congress. Hearsay evidence is often not allowed in court. But in 1995, state law had an exception for child abuse cases. Then, if a child under 14 were to confide in another person about being sexually or physically abused, that other person could testify about what the child said to him. SB 124 would have let hearsay enter into evidence in a new situation: if a child told another person he witnessed a third party being sexually or physically abused. State Legislature records confirm Barnes voted against SB 124. Versions passed both the House and Senate, but it died after the two chambers failed to agree on its final language. That's when things get cloudy. Although SB 124 never became law, the change it pushed for did. The bill's language was added to that year's successful House Bill 155, which created a central registry of the state's suspected and confirmed child abusers. Although Barnes opposed the change HB 155 made to hearsay evidence rules, he supported the bill because he thought creating the registry was important, Runge said. In March 1998, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that the change in hearsay evidence rules was unconstitutional. There was no rational reason for the law to treat defendants whose cases included hearsay evidence from children under 14 differently than those with hearsay evidence from older children, it decided. The court ruled there was no rational reason for the difference, which meant the law violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection before the law. (Ironically, that same month, the state Supreme Court also struck down the child abuse registry. They decided it violated due process rights because it included the names of people who had never been charged with a crime.) Barnes' current explanation for his 1995 vote is consistent with statements he made during his successful 1998 bid for governor. During that primary, fellow Democrat Lewis Massey issued a press statement that said the vote was evidence Barnes "has repeatedly sided with criminals against law-abiding Georgia citizens," according to a July 1998 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "To say you voted against something because you thought it was unconstitutional, that's not a legitimate excuse in my opinion," Massey added. Barnes replied that the bill would have created more problems in the future. "When you pass an unconstitutional act, then those who are convicted under that law go free. That law was unconstitutional, and it was the politics of grandstanding rather than governing," Barnes was quoted as saying. Robinson argued that the judges in the state Supreme Court cases were partisan. Plus, whether or not SB 124 was unconstitutional was a matter of speculation during the General Assembly vote. Furthermore, Barnes should have supported a law that's tough on crime to send a message to criminals that their actions won't be tolerated, Robinson argued. Indeed, the law's constitutionality was not a sure thing in 1995, but if you agree with Robinson, it doesn't necessarily follow that Barnes opposed a bill that would have made it easier to convict child abusers. Because the bill's language did become law, we got to see what would have happened if SB 124 had succeeded. And what happened is that the bill made things harder for prosecutors down the road. The state Supreme Court declared those changes unconstitutional, which means that prosecutors had to handle appeals from criminals convicted under that law. Since the constitutionality of the bill was not certain in 1995 and Barnes did vote against it, there is a sliver of truth to Deal's accusation. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Therefore Deal's claim meets our definition of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06687	"Governor (Perry), you were a Democrat, having worked for Al Gore as his campaign manager..."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/07/debra-medina/debra-medina-claims-rick-perry-was-democrat-and-al/	Editor’s note: After doubts were raised about Rick Perry’s role in Al Gore’s 1988 presidential campaign, we looked afresh into the matter, concluding in September 2011 that Perry was not Gore’s Texas campaign manager or chairman. This research has prompted us to revise downward our rating of Medina’s claim to Half True. Interviews and news articles confirm that Perry was among 28 Democratic legislators who endorsed Gore for president in January 1988. But there’s no proof he led or ran Gore’s campaign in Texas. It appears that a Democratic opponent slapped various Gore campaign leadership labels on Perry in a 1998 election year and, partly because Perry did not dispute them, the descriptives stuck. For archival purposes, the article below retains the text of our original Medina fact check, which was published Jan. 16, 2010. GOP gubernatorial hopeful Debra Medina, a Wharton businesswoman, started a question to Gov. Rick Perry during Thursday night's GOP gubernatorial debate by pointing out he hasn't always been a Republican. Medina said: "Governor, you were a Democrat, having worked for Al Gore as his campaign manager..." The Gore-y chapter of Perry's political life hasn't come up in a while. We decided to explore Medina's two-part claim. Perry didn't — and couldn't — dispute Medina's reminder that he was once a Democrat. Perry, whose father was repeatedly elected as a Democrat to the Haskell County Commission, won his first election, to the Texas House in 1984, as a Democrat. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 — a race that Perry won in an upset. In the debate, Perry didn't answer Medina's charge that he was Gore's campaign manager. In fact, according to news accounts and Perry's campaign, Perry served as Gore's Texas campaign chairman in 1988. What brought Perry to pitch in for Gore, whose candidacy washed out after he failed to do well outside his native South? According to news reports at the time, many conservative Texas Democrats put stock in Gore’s campaign, among them former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and then-House Speaker Gib Lewis, who flew to Washington to endorse Gore. Later, Perry said he found out Gore was far from a real conservative. "Going through that (Gore experience) was part of what started me through the process of changing parties in 1989," Perry said. "I came to my senses." In the Texas primary, Gore ran third to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Late last year, Perry revisited his disagreement with Gore over man’s impact on global warming. Suggesting he'd seen the light on the climate issue while Gore had drifted into darker territory, Perry joked: "I certainly got religion. I think he's gone to hell." So the two won't be launching any new joint ventures. But Medina correctly nudged Perry about his Democratic roots. And she was close to right about his Gore connection, though a visitor from another planet might read her statement to mean Perry was improbably Gore's national campaign manager. Instead, he was Gore's Texas chairman. We rate her statement Mostly True. This rating was changed to Half True on Sept. 7, 2011.

pomt-04205	Says he has never voted for raising taxes.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/05/saxby-chambliss/chambliss-defends-his-record-fighting-tax-increase/	There’s probably nothing worse for a conservative politician than to be accused of supporting tax increases. U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia has heard the whispers -- well, shouts -- from fellow conservatives suspicious of his charter membership in a bipartisan "gang" of senators that has been working for more than a year on a solution to the federal government’s budget problems. Shortly before Thanksgiving, Chambliss defended the work in a radio interview and had political reporters across the country rushing to their laptops to write about his comment that "I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge" he signed in 1994 not to raise taxes. There were countless news articles pondering whether Chambliss and other Republican lawmakers had severed ties with Grover Norquist, the influential tax watchdog who leads Americans for Tax Reform, the organization that created the pledge. In one follow-up interview a few days after the holiday, Chambliss attempted to convince skeptical conservatives by stating a claim about his track record on taxes. "I can tell you that neither Lindsey nor I have ever been in the business – nor have either one of us ever voted for increasing taxes," Chambliss said. Chambliss was referring to U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who also discussed voting for a plan to increase revenue. PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine whether Chambliss was correct when he claimed to have never voted for a tax increase. Chambliss was first elected to Congress in 1994. He served eight years in the House of Representatives before surprising many pundits in 2002 by defeating incumbent U.S. Sen. Max Cleland, a Democrat. Chambliss won re-election in 2008 and plans to run for a third term in 2014. But there has been some speculation that a Republican might challenge him. What constitutes as a tax increase can vary depending on whom you ask. "What is the definition of a tax increase?" asked Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University. "It's sort of like when President Clinton asked what the definition of ‘is’ is." Generally, a tax increase is simple to deduce. A lawmaking body votes to increase a rate that others pay for various services. Federal legislation often contains hundreds of pages of language with complicated minutiae that occasionally includes changes that contradict the ideals of some lawmakers. We found one bill that could contradict the senator’s claim. First, a little background on the pledge. During Chambliss’ 1994 campaign for the House, he signed the Americans for Taxpayer Reform Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The pledge is a promise by candidates to their constituents to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses, and … oppose any further reduction or elimination of deductions and credits." Similar types of pledges are offered in each state, and most Republican elected officials have signed the pledge. Chambliss has won the ATR "Hero of the Taxpayer" Award and was heartily endorsed by the organization’s president, Norquist, in his 2002 race against Cleland. Chambliss and Norquist have largely been compatriots on taxes, which made his initial comments in the radio interview newsworthy as Congress and President Barack Obama work on a solution to avoid what’s been called a "fiscal cliff" of tax increases and spending cuts starting in 2013. Norquist and Chambliss have since talked about the senator’s comments, and both men say they largely have the same goal not to raise federal income tax rates. But Chambliss said they disagree on some details. ATR did not return a request for comment to our question about whether Chambliss has voted to raise taxes. Norquist did answer that question at a recent event sponsored by the Washington-based news outlet Politico. "He's never voted for a tax increase," Norquist said of Chambliss. "He just talked about maybe someday doing that." PolitiFact Georgia reviewed other records and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s archives, and it reached out to political science professors and others to see whether there was any evidence that Chambliss has voted to raise taxes. Some we spoke with complained that Chambliss has been too accommodating on federal spending or hasn’t supported tuition deductions or child tax credits. None said Chambliss was big on raising taxes. Doug Kellogg, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, said there may be transportation or telecommunication bills over the years that include a fee hike or an increase in certain taxes, but he wasn’t aware of any legislation that Chambliss backed that included a tax increase on a large group of Americans. "It doesn’t necessarily seem like there’s a bloody glove," Kellogg said. A Georgia Democratic Party official brought forward what seemed to be the strongest evidence against the senator’s claim. In 1997, Chambliss voted in favor of raising the cigarette tax from 24 cents to 34 cents in 2000 and 39 cents in 2002. Chambliss spokeswoman Lauren Claffey said the increase was part of a balanced-budget deal in two pieces of legislation aimed at lowering taxes for most Americans. She included comments made by then-President Bill Clinton at the bill’s signing. "This act, together with the tax-cut legislation that I have also signed today, implements a historic agreement that will benefit generations of Americans," Clinton said. "These bills will balance the budget in a way that honors our values, invests in our people and cuts taxes for middle-class families. They are a victory for all parents who want a good education for their children and for all families working to build a secure future." News reports at that time said the deal would reduce taxes by about $140 billion for families and be the broadest tax cut since 1981. Chambliss defended his vote in a statement, saying it was part of a "comprehensive deal of tax provisions and spending cuts." "The net result of this legislative package was a balanced budget by way of substantial spending cuts coupled with substantial tax cuts, including a large cut in the capital gains tax rate that is widely credited with causing the economic boom of the late ’90s. The fact that some excise taxes were increased as other taxes were cut at far higher levels does not constitute a tax increase by my definition, nor by the definition of tax watchdog groups," he said. To sum up, Chambliss said he has never voted for a tax increase in his 18 years in Congress. By the standards of some of the most active federal tax watchdog organizations in the nation, Chambliss has not raised taxes. There was one clear example of a tax increase that would have an impact on smokers, but it was part of a bill that cut taxes for a large number of Americans. We rate this claim True.

pomt-05001	"If you have ever visited Nashville or Washington D.C. you will see MANY names and initials carved into ... desks."	mostly false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jul/18/julia-hurley/state-rep-julia-hruley-says-state-and-us-capitols-/	State Rep. Julia Hurley, R-Lenoir City, sent constituents an email last month declaring, among other things, that carving initials on desks is a "traditional act" of legislators and has a long history in both the state and national capitols. The Hurley history here dates back to last year, when the freshman lawmaker acknowledged carving her initials on her designated desk in the state House of Representatives chamber at the Tennessee Capitol toward the end of a long lawmaking day. After the incident got some media attention, she paid to have the desk refinished to remove the carved letters, J.C.H., at the suggestion of House Speaker Beth Harwell. In a June 23, 2012, email to constituents reproduced on some blogs, Hurley provided some explanation that she had not offered previously, including an assertion that the practice is commonplace and the media attention unwarranted. "If you have ever visited Nashville or Washington D.C. you will see MANY names and initials carved into the tops, sides, legs and inside drawers of desks with over a hundred years of history," she wrote. "Not only did this make front page news, the liberal media decided to associate Representative Hurley as being a vandal, while two hundred years of history has shown this to be a traditional act in all aspects of Legislators services." The description of desk carving as a normal legislative behavior struck us as an interesting assertion. Does Hurley have her history straight? In Washington, it appears Hurley is right about the U.S. Senate; but wrong about the U.S. House. U.S. senators have a long history of signing or etching their names into the drawer of their Senate desks. The tradition started in the early 20th century, around 1901 or 1902, when the first names started to show up, said Betty Koed, associate Senate historian in the Senate Historical Office. "Now it’s tradition, so most senators that come into office will sign their desk drawer in some form," Koed said. "In fact, the Senate curators who are the people in charge of taking care of the desks encourage senators to do that. There are Capitol ceremonies where the new member comes in to allow them to do that." Some senators use a pen to write their names in the desk drawer. Others etch their names into the drawer with a knife. "It’s not on the top or something that’s visible, but if you open the desk drawer of each of the old desks in the current Senate chamber, you’ll find a collection of signatures in there," Koed said. Some senators add their name every time they switch desks, so some names will appear on multiple desks. "Harry Truman, I think, signed three or four different desks because he moved from place to place," Koed said. "It’s a way to sort of put their mark on that desk but also to be part of a longstanding tradition." In the U.S. House, however, there is no such tradition. In fact, House members sit in theater-style seating and haven’t had actual desks since around 1913, according to the House’s Office of the Historian. Because they don’t have desks, there’s no place for them to write or etch their names. In Nashville, there is no such tradition for either the House or the Senate chamber. The State Capitol Commission, with a membership appointed by the governor and House and Senate speakers, oversees the state capitol building itself and all its furnishings in conjunction with the Department of General Services. Thad Watkins, general counsel for the Department of General Services, said that any marking on the state Capitol structure or its furnishings would "absolutely" require approval of the commission under the relevant state law and rules. The State Library and Archives and the State Museum would be involved as well, he said. In his nine years as department legal counsel, Watkins said, there has certainly never been a request for marking approval and he is unaware of any sought before that. "The state Capitol is a state treasure, a historic building," he said. "Safeguarding of the furnishings and the physical premises is taken very seriously. "I am not aware of anyone asking to mark or deface or leave an imprint on any state building," Watkins said. "You would need to ask (to comply with state rules and law)." Watkins suggested speaking as well with state Sen. Douglas Henry, D-Nashville, the Legislature's senior member, a longtime former member of the Capitol Commission and respected Tennessee history buff. Henry, who served his first term in the Legislature as a House member in the 1950s, said he has heard stories of Union soldiers putting marks on the Capitol and furnishings after seizing Nashville during the Civil War. Beyond that – and perhaps some defacement of furnishings and the building during the "tumultuous times" of the Reconstruction era – the senator said he knows of no tradition for carving initials or anything else on desks or other furnishings. He recalled there have been small plaques honoring deceased legislators – the late Rep. John Bragg in the House, for example. But those were duly approved in response to resolutions passed by the General Assembly. "I've never seen such a mark (initial carving) nor have I heard of such a mark," said Henry, 86. The Capitol this summer is undergoing a $15.7 million renovation and is closed to the public during the process. During a recent media tour, we found the House and Senate desks covered with protective plastic and in some cases pushed together, making a thorough check of all desks impractical. A random check of six desks in both the House and Senate chambers turned up no initials or markings inside or outside the desks – though the drawer on one House desk was locked. Still, WSMV-TV, which initially reported on the Hurley carving last year, did find some markings on other desks in the House chamber at the time. "We found the word 'Houston' on Rep. Tim Wirgau's desk, a dollar sign on Rep. Dennis Powers' territory, what appears to be the initials W.M. on Rep. Janis Sontany's desk, and an ‘A’ on Rep. Sheila Butt's desk," the station reported. Hurley, when asked about her recent email assertion, suggested that some desks may have initials inside their drawers. Otherwise, she said that the email was intended as her final comment on the initial-carving matter, that she has put it behind her and that the media should as well. The upshot is that, except for the U.S. Senate custom of names and initials inside desk drawers, there is no tradition of such doings in either Washington or Nashville. In Nashville, such carving is effectively prohibited – though it seems there have apparently been occasional episodes of unauthorized carving by someone. Those could have been done by legislators or by most anyone, since the Capitol is open to visits by the public most of the time. There could be other hidden and unauthorized carvings inside some locked desk drawers. But there are surely not "many" carvings of any sort outside the U.S. Senate, and what the representative suggests is a tradition is impossible in U.S. House and prohibited in the state House and state Senate. We rate Hurley’s historical assertion as Mostly False.	None	Julia Hurley	None	None	None	2012-07-18T13:13:46	2012-06-23	['Nashville,_Tennessee', 'Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-11551	The UNC athletic director’s $705,000 salary was "not at market. Not even close."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/feb/08/university-north-carolina/705k-below-market-rate-ncaa-athletic-director/	UNC-Chapel Hill athletics in recent years has reached historic heights and unprecedented lows. UNC last year won a national championship in men’s basketball – its most heralded program – and other teams have won a total of eight national titles since 2011. During the same period, the athletic department has been mired in a scandal that prompted a former federal prosecutor, a former North Carolina governor and the NCAA to investigate bogus classes and whether they were created to intentionally benefit athletes. So UNC faced some criticism in November when the Board of Governors granted its athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, an extra $200,000 a year over the next five years. Board member Marty Kotis said he worried about the "optics" and timing of the deal. A month prior, the NCAA wrapped up its years-long investigation by saying that it "could not conclude academic violations" in the case and wouldn’t punish UNC in the bogus classes scandal. However, the leader of the NCAA Committee on Infractions said student-athletes "likely benefited from the so-called paper courses" and that it was "more likely than not" that UNC athletes received fraudulent credit in association with the courses at the heart of the case. The committee leader also said it was "more likely than not" that members of the UNC athletic department steered athletes to those courses in an effort to maintain their eligibility. Board member Tom Fetzer called a million-dollar pay increase "ludicrous" and said he was embarrassed by the vote because of the NCAA’s comments on classes that benefitted athletes. Haywood Cochrane, chairman of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees, defended the move by saying Cunningham’s old $705,853 base salary left him underpaid compared to other athletic directors at large universities. "This was a reflection of the market, but he’s not at market," Cochrane said. "He’s not even close." Is that true? Is the going rate for an athletic director in one of the major athletic conferences more than $705,000 a year? PolitiFact reached out to members of the Board of Trustees to ask what they consider to be the market rate for athletic directors like Cunningham. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Cochrane responded by email, but didn’t elaborate on his position. "Bubba has done an exceptional job!" he wrote. "We do look at comps as part of our overall assessment and your research will, I believe, answer your question for you." Another trustee, Dwight Stone, responded similarly. "Why not do a little work and look up the top 25 Athletic Director compensations in the country and you can learn a lot," Stone said, adding: "There is this thing called Google and you can really find most anything." Well, Mr. Stone, the burden of proof in our fact-checking process falls on the person who made the claim. But we went to the interwebs and fired up that Google machine nonetheless. Here’s what we found. AD pay PolitiFact struggled to find a reliable, comprehensive list of salaries for athletic directors across the nation. However, we found data that offers a glimpse of it. The College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, known as CUPA-HR, gathers information on salaries in the academic field. Jacqueline Bichsel, the group’s director of research, provided us with a breakdown of median salaries for Chief Athletics Administrators during the 2016-2017 school year. The group’s findings aren’t comprehensive – there are a few schools that didn’t provide it with data – but most did. The median salary for athletics administrators at ACC schools is $549,215. These figures don’t take into account bonuses that ADs might receive if their schools achieve a certain level of academic and/or athletic success. The ACC median ranks lower than the median for each of the other "power five" conferences, which include the SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 and PAC 12. The median salaries for the conferences are as follows: Big Ten: $731,808 Big 12: $689,325 PAC 12: $655,000 SEC: $706,000 N.C. State University is the most comparable school in the state. The base salary for Debbie Yow, N.C. State’s AD, is $690,000, according to Fred Demarest, the school’s senior associate athletics director. So Cunningham’s base salary was higher than the median of schools in the ACC, Big 12 and Pac 12, roughly the same as ADs in the SEC and lower than the median salary for Big Ten ADs. But some athletic directors are paid more because of their level of experience, the difficulty of the job or the reputation of the school’s programs. This is where experts said Cunningham’s situation is unique. Bubba’s tenure UNC hired Cunningham in 2011. He previously worked six years as the AD for the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. There, GoHeels.com says Cunningham "guided the Golden Hurricane through its initial move to Conference USA and spearheaded a $60 million athletics initiative. Tulsa won 34 league championships during his tenure, more than any other school in Conference USA, and the football program played in five bowl games in his final six years. He was honored as the 2008-09 FBS Central Region Athletics Director of the Year, an award presented by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics." Since arriving at UNC, the Tar Heels have won nine national titles and made an additional 10 runner-up finishes. 2011: Men’s soccer. 2012: Women’s soccer. 2013: Women’s tennis and women’s lacrosse. 2015: Women’s tennis. 2016: Men’s tennis, as well as men’s and women’s lacrosse. 2017: Men’s basketball. Bubba’s hires None of those championships were won by coaches that Cunningham hired. Cunningham has hired four coaches during his tenure: men’s golf coach Andrew DiBitetto last July; wrestling coach Coleman Scott in 2015; track and field/cross country coach Harlis Meaders in 2012; and football coach Larry Fedora in 2011. With the exception of newcomer DiBitetto, who has yet to coach a full golf season, Cunningham’s hires have fared well. Given the amount of money it generates, the football team’s performance is likely the most important to Cunningham’s job security. So we’ll turn our attention there. The football team won three games and lost nine last year. But Fedora has an overall win percentage of .558. That’s slightly higher than his predecessor Butch Davis, who recorded a .549 win percentage (although some of those wins were retroactively voided by the NCAA). Fedora in 2015 took UNC to its first 11-win season since 1997. He was a Bear Bryant National Coach of the Year finalist in 2015 and was named National Coach of the Year by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Last summer, Cunningham signed Fedora to a contract extension through the 2022 season. Other accomplishments The university notes that, under Cunningham’s leadership, UNC launched an NCAA compliance review to be conducted by an outside firm and a master plan for UNC’s athletic facilities. UNC says "a transformative array of athletics facilities projects -- including a new football practice facility, lacrosse/soccer stadium, field hockey stadium and track and field complex – are also underway and will be completed by the fall of 2018." Cunningham’s work has led him to prominent positions. He currently serves as president of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and sits on the board of LEAD1, an association representing the ADs from the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision schools. Cunningham is also on the verge of signing UNC to a new athletic apparel deal with Nike. UNC’s current deal with Nike, and its Jordan Brand subsidiary, expires in June and is worth about $36.85 million in uniforms, footwear, apparel and cash considerations. Nike’s recent deals with Texas and Ohio State are worth more than $250 million over the next 15 years. UNC’s contract "will be a very good deal but not a blockbuster," like those schools’ deals, Cunningham said. What experts say To some degree, people (like houses) are worth what someone is willing to pay them. In that vein, UNC Chancellor Carol Folt said Cunningham is highly sought after. She said at that November trustees meeting that Cunningham had turned down a lucrative offer from the University of Florida because he wanted to stay at UNC. "He has done some extraordinary things for which he is quite well-known nationally," she said. "He’s viewed as probably one of the top five athletic directors in the country right now … So he’s on every short list." Jay Bilas, an ESPN basketball analyst and attorney, said he considers a "middle of the pack" annual salary for elite athletic directors to be about $750,000. He thinks Cunningham’s new contract is "a great deal" for UNC. "He is among the very best in his field. Thoughtful, smart, forward thinking, and he did a tremendous job shepherding UNC through the NCAA infractions process," Bilas said. "As you know, he was not at UNC during the period at issue, but was at the helm throughout the entire adjudication of the matter. I couldn’t respect an AD more." Tom McMillen, president and CEO of Lead1, said people should compare Cunningham with ADs at other elite schools. "UNC’s compensation is on the high end of the ACC but not the high end of college sports," McMillen said. "I think that [what Cochrane said] is an accurate statement." Comparables Roger Denny is a partner at Spencer Fane, a St. Louis-based firm that specializes in researching salaries of athletic directors and coaches. Denny’s firm published its own set of AD salary data last July. He noted that ADs at other big schools are being paid substantially more than Cunningham. He offered a handful of relevant comparisons from a recent survey: Jim Sterk, Missouri: $850,000 Dan Guerrero, UCLA: more than $1 million Sheahon Zenger, Kansas: base salary of $700,000. Dan Radakovich, Clemson: $875,000. "Bubba led them through perhaps the most complex NCAA case there’s ever been," Denny said. "Just keeping the ship moving forward during that firestorm of issues is an accomplishment in and of itself." Denny noted UNC’s progress on its athletics facilities master plan. The new football practice facility is long overdue and "probably a lot of the reason Larry Fedora is still there," he said. Building new facilities for non-revenue sports "is quite impressive." "I think he’s distinguished himself to a point that he should be considered among the top quarter of athletic directors," Denny said. "So then, within the Power Five, that suggests that a salary even more than he received would be easily supportable." Our ruling Cochrane, the chairman of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees, said Cunningham’s old $705,853 base salary was "not at market … not even close." It’s a stretch to say that Cunningham’s salary was "not even close" to what the market rate is for someone with his experience. However, experts agree that compared to his peers, Cunningham was well underpaid for his work at a university that’s achieved so much success despite facing adversity. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09296	"Thanks to you, in under one week we have the largest GOP (Facebook) page in the Governor's race!"	true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-republican-governor-facebook/	Wealthy Florida businessman Rick Scott entered the Republican primary for governor on April 9, 2010, promising to wage a new kind of campaign against the veteran politicians running for the GOP nomination, state Sen. Paula Dockery and Attorney General Bill McCollum. Scott launched his first TV ad on April 13, 2010, and quickly set up a Facebook page. In just a week, Scott says, that new campaign already is showing promise. Scott, a former hospital CEO and outspoken opponent of President Barack Obama's health care reform, said on April 19 that his fan page on the social networking website Facebook already reaches more people than the pages of Dockery and McCollum, who both have been running for months. "Thanks to you, in under one week we have the largest GOP (Facebook) page in the Governor's race!" Scott said in a status update. The number of people who follow a Facebook page isn't the most significant measure of support (the press secretary for Dockery follows Scott's Facebook page to keep track of her opponent's campaign, for example, and political journalists and strategists follow most candidates' pages in case they make news). But the total number of followers on Facebook and Twitter is a statistic campaigns like to throw around in order to appear web-savvy and more popular. It also can be a way for a campaign to test messages, or organize events. We measured the three Republican candidate fan pages at 11:30 a.m. on April 21, 2010. Scott had 5,611 people who "like" his page. McCollum had 5,070. Dockery had 4,281. We should point out, however, that likely Democratic nominee Alex Sink, the state's chief financial officer, had 10,779 people who "like" her page. Still, when it comes to the Republican campaign for governor, newcomer Scott says he can reach more people on the social-networking website Facebook than either McCollum or Dockery and he's right.

pomt-02562	Says Marshawn Lynch is "second all-time in terms of average yards per rush only to Terrell Davis."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/31/joel-klatt/marshawn-lynch-second-terrell-davis-post-season-ya/	Meet the press, he does not want. Marshawn Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks’ Skittles-loving running back, openly admitted to reporters covering the leadup to Super Bowl XLVIII that he was only talking to them "so I don’t have to pay the fine," referring to $50,000 the NFL said he would have to pay for not talking to the media. "I really don't have too much to say, boss. I really don't," he said during his second seven-minute interview that week, according to CBSSports.com. "I appreciate it, but I don't get it. I'm just here so I won't get fined, boss. That's the only reason I'm here." The reluctance to talk from a player nicknamed Beast Mode gave sports pundits something new to discuss ahead of Sunday's big game. Was the media overreacting, or was Lynch kind of being a jerk? Joel Klatt, a host and analyst on Fox Sports’ Fox Football Daily, asked a panel of former NFL players Randy Moss, Brian Urlacher and Michael Strahan about Lynch’s wave-making in a Jan. 29 segment. The ex-players agreed that Lynch looked uncomfortable dealing with the media. Klatt said his reluctance won’t matter much to Seahawks fans by Sunday. "Really, all they care about is that his production continues in the direction that it's going," Klatt said. "When you talk about postseason, second all-time in terms of average yards per rush only to Terrell Davis. So this guy can definitely play." We wanted to know if Klatt was right about Lynch’s postseason rushing prowess. (A spokesman for Fox Sports did not get back to us.) We turned to the Elias Sports Bureau, which serves up sports statistics for professional sports leagues, including the NFL, and media outlets like ESPN. Statistician Frank Labombarda kindly crunched the numbers for us. For the non-sports junkies, rushing basically measures the progress a team moves down the field. And yards per rush is simply rushing yards divided by rushing attempts. How has Lynch performed in the playoffs? He has rushed 109 times for 560 yards or an average of 5.1 yards per rush. (Nearly 12 percent of Lynch’s playoff yards came on one 67-yard run in the 2011 playoffs. That one run raises Lynch’s average rush by more than half a yard.) That is indeed less than former Davis, the former Denver Broncos running back, who averaged a whopping 5.6 yards per rush over 204 carries. But Lynch's numbers also fall below a host of other NFL players, we found. Here's a sampling: Former San Diego Chargers running back Keith Lincoln (23 attempts, 12 yards per rush); San Francisco QB Colin Kaepernick (51 attempts, 10 yards per rush); New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount (29 attempts, 5.9 yards per rush); Former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Merril Hoge (39 attempts, 6.3 yards per rush). And so on. Turns out, Klatt missed a key qualifier: players who have a minimum of 100 rushing attempts. "You have to say minimum 100 attempts," Labombarda said. "There are lots of guys who have higher averages." Among players with a minimum of 100 attempts, Lynch is currently second, Labombarda said. The Seahawks running back is sandwiched between Davis -- at 5.6 yards -- and former Los Angeles Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs running back Marcus Allen, who played for 16 seasons and in 15 playoff games, averaging 5 yards per rush in the postseason. Our ruling Klatt said Marshawn Lynch is "second all-time in terms of average yards per rush only to Terrell Davis." When counting all NFL players, Klatt is wrong. But he is on solid ground when calculating for players who have run the ball at least 100 times in the playoffs. Klatt’s statement is partially accurate. So we rate it Half True.

pomt-14643	"In 40 years of broadcast, I have never endorsed any candidate."	true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/26/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-ted-cruz-hed-never-endorsed-candid/	Glenn Beck, the conservative former Fox News host who now has a radio show and online live-video program, declared at an Iowa rally for Texan Ted Cruz that he was breaking with his own long history simply by endorsing someone for office. "The press today has been reporting that I’m here to endorse Ted Cruz," Beck said at an appearance with Cruz in Ankeny, Iowa the same week Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump. "But let me tell you, in 40 years of broadcast, I have never endorsed any candidate. And I haven’t endorsed any candidate mainly because for a lot of those years, nobody really wanted my endorsement," Beck said with a laugh. "And quite honestly, I have never endorsed anybody because I haven’t trusted any of the weasels, no matter how good they are." Beck made that comment a little over seven minutes into his half-hour presentation, which concluded with Beck saying the press was right: "I am here to announce that I am officially endorsing Ted Cruz." We were curious about Beck’s declaration that he hadn't previously endorsed a candidate. We failed to reach Beck for elaboration. Meantime, our search of the Nexis news database indicated no previous Beck endorsement of a presidential aspirant. And while we found we found two reports of Beck endorsing a candidate, further review showed one reported endorsement didn’t happen and the other was a Beck joke. Illinois ‘endorsement’ A Feb. 2, 2010, item, in the Inside the Beltway column in The Washington Times, said Illinois businessman Adam Andrzejewski, among Republicans running for governor, had been drawing fresh "tea-party" support. The item continued: "Fox News host Glenn Beck has also endorsed Mr. Andrzejewski," as had commentator Rush Limbaugh. We reached Andrzejewski, who replied by email: "In real-time, many people in Glenn Beck’s radio listening audience took his broadcast as an endorsement of my 2010 campaign for governor of Illinois. However, Beck clarified the following day that he did not endorse, but instead had just replayed the endorsement of my candidacy by Polish President and Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa." Andrzejewski pointed us to a Feb. 2, 2010, post by the American Spectator stating Beck had said on the air that day that he was "getting a lot of mail that I endorsed" Andrzejewski when, Beck said, he’d only intended to share audio of Walesa speaking in favor of the candidate. "I don’t endorse candidates and I don’t know this guy, but I wish him all the best," Beck said. California ‘endorsement’ On May 16, 2011, Californian Dan Adler’s House campaign issued a press release headlined, "Glenn Beck`s Surprising First Ever Endorsement Goes to Democrat Dan Adler in California`s Special Congressional Election." The release opened: "For the first time in his life, conservative TV and radio personality Glenn Beck has given an endorsement to a candidate running for Congress in a special election tomorrow. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the endorsement did not go to someone of Beck's political extreme but to Dan Adler, a lifelong Democrat who is socially progressive. Adler, who has been urging voters of the South Bay community area to elect a citizen legislator instead of a career politician, recently caught Beck's eye for populist-themed Send a Mensch to Congress TV spots." The release continued: "In a posting on Beck’s website today, the conservative talk show host said, ‘people should vote based on principles and values and not race or creed,’ he then moved to ‘heartily endorse’ Adler." The release said that on Beck’s May 13, 2011, radio show, "Beck and his cohorts ridiculed the Asian American and other minority voters who make up nearly 50% of California’s 36th District. Then a confused Beck endorsed Adler’s candidacy, stating that Californians deserve to see Adler in Congress and that ‘you’re going to love him.’" We clicked next to a May 16, 2011, post on Beck’s website suggesting Beck made his endorsement tongue-in-cheek (and there’s a full Beck-sponsored summary of the not-for-real endorsement here). According to the post, Beck had included an Adler ad on his program the week before as the worst political ad ever. The post on Beck’s site continued: "The ads, promoting Californian Dan Adler, featured a Korean woman who said that she should vote for Adler simply because she’s Korean and he’s Jewish and that minorities should ‘stick together.’ The ad also featured several offensive stereotypes of Koreans and Asians. Glenn took issue with the ad, saying that people should vote based on principles and values, not race or creed." That doesn’t read like Beck was poised to endorse. The post on Beck’s site went on: "Somehow, Adler took Glenn’s criticism as an endorsement and released a statement declaring himself the candidate endorsed by Glenn Beck. This morning, Dan may regret his statement. ‘It doesn’t make any sense for a progressive to want my endorsement. So, today I heartily endorse — what’s his name? — Dan Adler. I want the voters in California to know that we are practically brothers of the brain,’ Glenn said. ‘We are so like minded, he has the same positions on almost everything, although he’s not coming out and saying those things.’ ‘We both believe that the rich are paying far too much. Pay their fair share? They pay more than their fair share. They deserve a tax break,’ Glenn declared in his support for he and Adler’s shared stance. Let’s see if the progressive Adler decides to run with Glenn’s support." Next, we reached Adler, whose current biographical entry on a business website says Adler’s candidacy drew "Beck's first-ever political endorsement." Adler, describing himself as a liberal Democrat, told us that after Beck criticized his ad, his campaign issued the 2011 release saying Beck had endorsed him toward building a pre-election buzz. "I never saw it as a real official endorsement," Adler said though he called back to stress Beck’s statement at the time that California deserved Adler. "Tongue in cheek or not, one would certainly count it as an endorsement," Adler said. Media Matters for America To our inquiry, Laura Keiter of the liberal Media Matters for America, whose declared mission is to monitor and correct conservative misinformation "in the U.S. media," said by email that while Beck previously made no presidential endorsement, he had made clear who he supported or opposed, "walking a thin line," Keiter said. Keitor offered instances of Beck seemingly taking a side such as Beck in January 2008 telling Republican hopeful Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, on the air that he would vote for him or Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president. Beck went on to say that if the nominee proved to be former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or Sen. John McCain (who later proved the nominee), "I would look at those two guys and go, I can’t do that." In an October 2010 web post, Media Matters said Beck had repeatedly said he doesn’t endorse candidates yet also had indicated support or opposition to specific hopefuls; that year, Beck urged listeners to oppose Democrat Richard Blumenthal in a Connecticut U.S. Senate race; called Democrat Chris Coons of Nevada a bad Senate candidate; and said he was about to break his no-endorsement policy by endorsing Marco Rubio and another hopeful for the Florida U.S. Senate seat ultimately won by Rubio. Our ruling Beck declared in Iowa he hadn’t previously endorsed a candidate. Beck made a kidding endorsement of a Democrat a few years ago and previously urged support for, or votes against, individuals. But we spotted no evidence of Beck lock-down endorsing a candidate before he stood with Cruz. We rate Beck's statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-11093	"Trump’s DHS secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/13/newsflash/website-misleads-about-arrests-sanctuary-cit/	A headline on a website called Newsflash overstates efforts by the Trump administration to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities and their elected officials. "Trump’s (Department of Homeland Security) secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders," said an undated headline on flashnewss.club, operating under the banner "Newsflash." Sanctuary cities refers broadly to jurisdictions with policies that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. President Donald Trump has promised to withhold federal funds from these cities, claiming they attract criminals and make communities less safe. The story also claimed "it won’t be long until Trump’s DHS gets a warrant for pioneers" of communities and states with "haven city strategies." Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that there is an element of truth to the claim, but it is also a sweeping exaggeration of what’s been said. At a Jan. 16 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about a comment made by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official on Fox News. The official, Thomas D. Homan, said on TV that he asked the Justice Department to look into criminal charges for elected officials with sanctuary policies, Harris said. The comment was made specifically about California elected officials after the enactment of the California Values Act, according to Harris. Harris: "My question is whether DHS is currently working with the Justice Department to bring section 8-USC 1324 charges or any criminal charges against state or local officials." Nielsen: "I believe the request was made. The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available. The context of this is, of course, not only putting my ICE officers at risk but also finding an efficient and effective way to enforce our immigration laws." Harris: "So, you are aware of cases in which this code will be used to criminally charge elected officials?" Nielsen: "I am not aware of any cases, no ma'am. I believe it was just a request to look into it." At the hearing, Nielsen acknowledged that the Department of Homeland Security had asked the Justice Department to look into the issue, but did not confirm, as Newsflash claimed, that they are already preparing to make arrests. The website also presented a revised version of what Nielsen said, quoting her as saying "The Department of Justice is looking into what roads might be accessible." (She said: "The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available.") DHS referred PolitiFact to the January hearing but did not say what avenues, if any, the Justice Department had determined to take — or if it had responded to DHS’ request. The Justice Department did not respond to our query. Newsflash cited the The Washington Times as the source that "revealed" the information. A January story on The Washington Times headlined, "Homeland Security pursues charges against leaders of sanctuary cities." The story offers a more toned-down version, saying DHS "has asked federal prosecutors to see if they can lodge criminal charges against sanctuary cities." Our ruling Newsflash claimed, "Trump’s DHS secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders." While DHS has asked the Justice Department to look into what charges could be pursued against elected officials from sanctuary cities, DHS’s top official did not go far enough to say arrests were coming. What the DHS secretary said in January was she was not aware of any criminal cases against leaders of cities with policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

pomt-09532	The House passed a pay-as-you-go rule that said, "If you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc., you had to pay for it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/10/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-touts-democrats-revival-pay-you-go-budget-r/	In recent months, the two parties have sparred over federal spending, with Republicans charging that Democrats have spent taxpayer dollars too freely and Democrats countering that they've made efforts to curb the nation's rising deficits. One of the Democrats' main arguments about their record of fiscal responsibility is their advocacy of "pay-as-you-go" (or "PAYGO") policies. These policies have existed in several different forms over the years, but the general principle that binds them all together is that they require new spending to be paid for by making sure that the new costs are balanced by spending cuts, revenue increases or a combination of the two. President Barack Obama has often praised PAYGO, though PolitiFact ruled that his April 2009 claim that PAYGO "helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s" was an exaggeration and Half True. More recently, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made a point of praising PAYGO. Her comments, in a Feb. 4, 2010, press conference, came on the heels of House passage of a bill that did two things -- it raised the limit on how far into debt the United States can go, and it established a PAYGO law. Pelosi said, "When I became speaker of the House ... our majority made PAYGO the rule of the House -- that if you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc., you had to pay for it. There was no open-ended spending." We decided to see whether Pelosi was accurately describing what her majority did. The PAYGO that Pelosi's comment refers to -- the one instituted in 2007 -- was a House rule that governs how bills are taken up in the House. (This rule is distinct from the law that is expected to be signed by the president, although the two are broadly similar, differing mainly in operational details.) The rule approved in 2007 -- and still in force -- effectively bars the House from taking up a bill if it would, on balance, increase projected deficits. So, a bill that cut taxes by $10 billion would need to be offset by a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases that equaled $10 billion. Similarly, a bill that added $10 billion in spending would have to be offset by cuts elsewhere or tax increases totaling $10 billion. A bill does not have to be "deficit neutral" in every year; rather, it has to be deficit-neutral over a defined "budget window" going forward. The rule states that if any House member believes that a bill or an amendment being brought to the floor violates PAYGO, that lawmaker can raise an objection. If the presiding officer determines that the bill does indeed violate PAYGO, it effectively kills the bill. However, as a practical matter, it rarely happens that way. Either a bill brought up for consideration will comply with PAYGO, or else it will be in violation of PAYGO but with the majority leadership's support for waiving the PAYGO requirement. Most commonly, the leadership will push a waiver through the House Rules Committee, which historically is an instrument of the leadership. The Rules Committee would write a rule that effectively overrides PAYGO for the bill in question. Once the committee passes that rule -- which is almost a certainty -- the majority party only needs to corral a simple majority of the chamber to pass it, which in turn paves the way for passage of the PAYGO-waived bill itself. Those who say the benefits of PAYGO have been oversold have focused on two concerns. The first is that the PAYGO rule doesn't touch a number of important types of federal spending. And the second is that House Democrats have been too quick to waive PAYGO. On the first point, several types of spending are exempt from PAYGO. A big one is discretionary spending, which includes everything from defense and homeland security to education, housing and transportation. "Congress could triple the discretionary budget tomorrow without triggering PAYGO," writes Brian Riedl, a budget scholar with the Heritage Foundation. "That's quite a loophole." While spending on these programs is supposed to be controlled by annual targets set in congressional budget plans, PAYGO itself has no effect on them. So, to the extent that "an investment," to use Pelosi's words, is undertaken using discretionary spending, it's not affected by PAYGO. That's one misleading part of her statement. Meanwhile, any spending increases currently scheduled under the law are also exempt. That means that even as the costs of programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid grow, policymakers are not required to make changes to finance these costs. PAYGO kicks in only if lawmakers seek to create a new entitlement, or to expand or increase existing entitlement benefits beyond what the current formula says. "Total entitlement spending can continue growing 6 percent annually without triggering PAYGO," Riedl writes. "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid can continue down their path to swallow up the entire federal budget." The new law now awaiting the president's signature would implement additional exemptions from PAYGO, some permanent, some temporary. According to the newsletter CongressDaily, the measure includes "an unlimited exemption for extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the middle class," plus two-year exemptions for updates to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and reductions to estate taxes, as well as a five-year exemption for bills that delay Medicare reimbursement cuts for physicians. The critics' second complaint concerns the waiver process. Even on bills for which PAYGO would be in effect, they say, the House Democratic majority has been willing to use waivers to sidestep their own rule. "Congress waived PAYGO every time it proved even slightly inconvenient," Riedl writes. "The lawmakers waived it to extend unemployment benefits. They waived it to create a $63 billion veterans' entitlement. They waived it for the $787 billion 'stimulus' bill. [Pelosi] suggested that PAYGO be waived for any bill she feels will help the economy. Even when PAYGO wasn't waived, Congress resorted to gimmicks for compliance." Nadeam Elshami, a spokesman for Pelosi, defends the Democratic record on PAYGO. He said that PAYGO waivers have only been used on "emergencies" -- such as the stimulus -- and for "the extension of current policies," such as the AMT update and the Medicare reimbursement increase. In the case of the AMT, Elshami added, the House initially passed a version that complied with PAYGO but could not convince the Senate to go along. In addition, Elshami said, "viewing PAYGO's efficacy by only looking at the exceptions doesn’t present a complete picture of how the House has dealt with its rules regarding PAYGO. Many of the major acts under Democrats were PAYGO-compliant." He specifically cited the House version of the health care reform bill, the farm bill and the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Elshami also fired back at the Republicans' record on the deficit, noting that party leaders essentially waived PAYGO when they passed the 2001 and 2003 rounds of tax cuts and that they created the Medicare drug benefit in 2003 after the prior incarnation of PAYGO had lapsed -- bills that added hundreds of billions of dollars to the federal deficit. Outside experts agree that PAYGO has had some impact. "I think it has changed the culture," said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a centrist think tank. "I do see a lot of bills proposed with offsets. The rule has caused Congress to think more carefully about the costs of what they pass." Still, Goldwein said that critics have a fair point that the Democratic majority has been quick to waive PAYGO when it faced tough choices. "It sounds like what Speaker Pelosi said was technically true, that they instituted PAYGO, but what is implied is false -- that they paid for all their new spending and tax cuts," Goldwein said. So let's look back at Pelosi's statement. It's an undeniable fact that the new Democratic majority in 2007 "made PAYGO the rule of the House," as she said. But the second part of her statement -- "if you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc., you had to pay for it" -- contains some aspects that are misleading. Investments made with discretionary spending, from highway-building to elementary school aid, were never supposed to be subject to PAYGO. Nor were ordinary increases in entitlements. In addition, even for key bills that should have been subject to PAYGO, Democratic leaders have acted to waive the rule on several occasions. So we rate Pelosi's statement Half True.

pomt-07694	Says Justice Elena Kagan recused herself in "many cases where she had little role" as solicitor general, simply because of the appearance of a conflict of interest.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/07/anthony-weiner/rep-anthony-weiner-says-elena-kagan-has-recused-he/	On March 2, 2011, Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly engaged in a heated debate about when it’s appropriate for justices to recuse themselves from cases before the Supreme Court. After the exchange became a mini-sensation on YouTube, several readers suggested we fact-check it. Weiner argued that Justice Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from any case that challenges the constitutionality of the health care law backed by President Barack Obama. Weiner argued that Thomas’ wife, Virginia, worked for groups that oppose the law, which, he said, gives Justice Thomas a financial stake in the outcome of the case. We’ve decided to check two separate claims from the testy interview, which ended with Weiner's sarcastic kicker, "Great interview. Aces." In this item, we’ll look at Weiner’s statement that Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself in "many cases where she had little role" as solicitor general, "simply because the appearance (of a conflict of interest) was there." (In a separate item, we scrutinize Weiner's argument that Justice Thomas must recuse himself in the health care case.) Before Kagan became a Supreme Court justice last fall, she served as solicitor general -- the official who argues the Obama administration's position on cases before the court. Due to the solicitor general’s extensive role with the court -- the position is often called the 10th Justice -- anyone who moves from solicitor general to the court will inevitably encounter cases that their former office handled and must decide whether to recuse themselves. Here’s the dialogue between Weiner and Kelly addressing Kagan and her recusals: Weiner: "You said (Kagan) had to recuse herself. She did not. She chose to in many cases where she had very little role in, simply because the appearance was there. That’s what Justice Thomas should do…." Kelly: "If you were a lawyer in the case, you have to recuse yourself even if you signed a brief. Even if you signed a brief, you have to." Weiner: "She did not recuse herself only in those circumstances. That’s the point. (She recused herself) any time she was even in a meeting (where the case was discussed)." We should start by noting there is no official log of recusals. So we’re reliant on data compiled by Supreme Court journalists, including Tony Mauro of the National Law Journal and Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog, who look through opinions and other official court documents and count the number of times justices recuse themselves. (While a justice’s recusal is noted for the record, the court does not release the reason for the recusal.) A SCOTUSblog tally lists 21 final rulings in which Kagan recused herself. The number is higher if you include cases that aren't tallied, such as decisions not to hear a case. Kagan -- and the senators who questioned her at her confirmation hearings -- were well aware of her need to recuse herself from cases during her first term on the court. "I would recuse myself from any case in which I've been counsel of record at any stage of the proceedings, in which I've signed any kind of -- of brief," Kagan testified in response to a question from Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., during a confirmation hearing on June 29, 2010. "So that's a flat rule. In addition to that, … I would recuse myself in any case in which I'd played any kind of substantial role in the process. … I think that that would include any case in which I've officially formally approved something. So one of the things that the solicitor general does is approve appeals or approve amicus briefs to be filed in lower courts or approve interventions." True to her word, Kagan has followed through by recusing even in cases that may seem minor. Goldstein wrote that in at least four cases, Kagan recused herself because she had signed a "no-participation slip" for a case that later went to the Supreme Court. Such a document simply says that the government has no interest in becoming involved with the case. "It is my sense," said Rex R. Perschbacher, a professor at the University of California-Davis School of Law, "that she has been particularly sensitive to the issue of recusing herself whenever she had a modest involvement with the case or issues as solicitor general." But was she simply abiding by the law? The law in question is one that Weiner cited in the Fox interview. The law says that "any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned," or if "he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy." In Kagan’s case, she appears to be following the law and recusing herself in instances not only when she was "counsel, adviser or material witness" but also where she has "expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy" -- even if it is in a routine memorandum bearing her signature that says the government is not taking sides. Contrary to Weiner's claim that she is going beyond the law, this strikes experts as playing precisely within the rules. Robert Alt, deputy director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that Weiner’s error is in assuming that Kagan’s recusal even for minor participation in a case means she’s recusing herself because of appearances alone. In fact, Alt argues, Kagan is required by law to do so. "Having ‘little role’ is not the standard and is not an exemption, even if the role is slight," Alt said. "As a government attorney, if you just provide legal advice but are not counsel of record, you are still required to recuse." Goldstein agrees. Kagan has "recused from any case in which she played a role while previously working in the government, even a trivial role," he told PolitiFact. "That’s a good, broad, bright-line rule." Ronald Rotunda, a professor at Chapman University School of Law, testified during the confirmation hearings that "if the participant, not simply as a counsel, but as an adviser, whether his opinions are public or private, whether they're oral or written, if he's expressed an opinion concerning the merits of a particular case or controversy, he must disqualify himself. … (It) doesn't matter that she's no longer the counselor of record, that the deputy solicitor general has taken over. She also has to recuse herself if she was an adviser concerning the proceeding -- that is, gave advice about the particular proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of a particular case or controversy." So where does this leave us? We should first note that the Supreme Court is tight with information about recusals, so we can’t be entirely certain about Kagan’s thought process. It’s possible that she has taken part in some cases in which she’s had a minor but tangible role. But in making the case that Thomas should recuse himself on the health care bill, Weiner held up Kagan as an example of a justice who went beyond what the recusal law dictated, adhering instead to what the appearance would be. But while Weiner is right that Kagan has chosen to recuse herself even when her participation in a given case seems minor, she still made her decision based on what the law demands. We see no evidence that she’s gone further than the law would for the sake of appearances. On balance, we rate Weiner’s statement Half True.

pomt-03116	"Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman’s health."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/19/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-ad-says-cuccinelli-opposes-all-abortions/	Democrat Terry McAuliffe keeps returning to abortion in his effort to paint Republican Ken Cuccinelli as a conservative extremist. A new ad by McAuliffe features Holly Puritz, a Norfolk obstetrician and gynecologist, saying she’s "offended" by Cuccinelli. "Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman’s health," she says. We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for proof of its blanket claim. Spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to Cuccinelli’s support of personhood bills in 2007 and 2012 that would have granted legal rights to human embryos from the moment of conception. Those bills, he said, would have banned all abortions. Cuccinelli, as we’ve noted before, did support personhood bills. But that doesn’t mean he opposes abortion in every circumstance. Since his first campaign for the state Senate in 2002, he has backed a narrow exception for abortions in cases where a mother’s life would be endangered by remaining pregnant. Cuccinelli’s position was well known to McAuliffe’s campaign. In a Sept. 17 news release announcing the ad and justifying its claims, McAuliffe’s camp noted that during a 2009 debate, "Cuccinelli said he would support abortion only when the woman’s life was at risk." While researching another abortion-related claim this summer, we asked Cuccinelli’s camp if the candidate still carved out that lone exception. His advisers declined to answer. The Cuccinelli campaign did, however, confirm for FactCheck.org and The Washington Post, earlier this month that the candidate still holds that abortions should be allowed only to save a mother’s life. Both organizations published articles containing the information about a week before McAuliffe’s commercial debuted. Statistics are not available for the number of abortions that are performed to save the life of a mother. Neither the Guttmacher Institute nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect such data. Guttmacher, in a 2004, conducted a survey of 1,209 abortion patients. Four percent of the women cited personal health problems as the chief reason they were having an abortion. Our ruling McAuliffe’s ad says, "Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman’s health." Cuccinelli is an adamant opponent of abortion, but he has consistently supported one rare exception: Allowing abortion when a mother’s life is endangered by pregnancy. His position was known to McAuliffe’s campaign and incongruously cited in its news release announcing the ad. It’s not easy to overstate Cuccinelli’s objections to abortion, but McAuliffe’s ad manages to do just that. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04653	On new dollar coins, "'In God We Trust' is gone!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/11/chain-email/taking-god-we-trust-coins-was-debunked-years-ago/	On the campaign trail recently, Mitt Romney brought up an issue that sounded familiar to us: the question of whether "In God We Trust" has been removed from U.S. coins. Appearing in Virginia Beach, Va., on Sept. 8, 2012, Romney recited the Pledge of Allegiance, then continued, "The promises that were made in that pledge are promises I plan on keeping if I'm president, and I've kept them so far in my life. That pledge says ‘under God.’ I will not take ‘God’ out of the name of our platform. I will not take ‘God’ off our coins and I will not take God out of my heart." The focus on God invoked the Democrats’ recent decision -- later reversed -- to remove "God" from the party’s official platform at the Democratic National Convention. President Barack Obama’s campaign took Romney’s comment as a veiled dig at the president. Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki fired back, "Look, this is nothing more than a desperate attack based on a false premise by the Romney team and its sad that the debate has been driven to this level of discourse. The president believes as much that God should be taken off a coin as he does that aliens will attack Florida. It’s an absurd question to be raised." Because Romney in Virginia Beach didn’t directly accuse President Barack Obama of removing "In God We Trust" from the nation’s coins, we won’t put his comment to the Truth-O-Meter. But since the issue has emerged in the presidential campaign, we will instead return to the question of "In God We Trust" and coins, which we originally fact-checked in 2010 regarding a chain email. The original chain email never really went away. A reader forwarded it to PolitiFact for fact-checking as recently as Aug. 28, 2012, just days before Romney’s speech in Virginia Beach. As we wrote in 2010, the email has the standard ingredients of an Internet falsehood -- sloppy punctuation, an abundance of exclamation points, a plausible story ("I received one from the Post Office as change and I asked for a dollar bill instead"), a request to spread the email far and wide ("Please send to all on your mailing list!!!") and screaming capital letters ("'IN GOD WE TRUST' IS GONE!!!") . The people forwarding the email included some snarky comments such as "Don't know anything about this, but it does not surprise me. Typical of todays (sic) government." A Google search revealed that the email had been debunked long before by FactCheck.org and by Snopes.com. The use of "In God We Trust" on coins dates to the Civil War era, though the phrase only became the nation’s official motto in 1956, and began appearing on paper currency (as well as all coins) after that. While the use of the motto on money has been broadly popular -- a 2003 Gallup poll found 90 percent approval among the public -- it has also been the target of occasional lawsuits citing the separation of church and state. The best-known case concerning "In God We Trust" and money was filed by church-state-separation activist Michael Newdow. It was argued in 2007 and rejected in 2010 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In recent years, the U.S. Mint has produced several series of dollar coins. A Native American series originated in 2000 with the Sacagawea Golden Dollar and was succeeded by a broader Native American series, also featuring Sacagawea, in 2009. The presidential series began in 2007, releasing four coins a year to honor deceased U.S. presidents in chronological order. The chain email included a picture of a hand holding a dollar coin with a picture of President George Washington, so we’ll focus on that series. The law that authorized the coins called for the U.S. president to be on the front, the Statue of Liberty on the back, and, on the edge of the coin, the year of minting as well as the inscriptions "E Pluribus Unum" and "In God We Trust." The placement of "In God We Trust" quickly became controversial. In May 2007, a bill was introduced in the House that would require "In God We Trust" to appear on a face of the presidential dollar coins rather than the edge. That bill ultimately attracted 101 co-sponsors, all of them Republican (including Romney’s vice presidential nominee, Paul Ryan). "Once you start turning your back on the good Lord, I think you are going to reap the whirlwind, and this is something this nation cannot afford to do right now," said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., in a floor speech urging the coinage change. Romney himself joined the chorus on Sept. 22, 2007, in remarks at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference in Mackinac Island, Mich. "We recognize the hand of the Creator in the founding of our nation," Romney said. "We will fight to keep the words ‘under God’ in the Pledge of Allegiance. Have you seen the new dollar coin? ‘In God We Trust’ has been moved. It's not on the face of the coin anymore, it's on the edge -- virtually invisible, just like the (American Civil Liberties Union) wants Him to be. I will go to work to get God back on the front of our coin." The critics won the day. In December 2007, President George W. Bush signed a law that specified that "In God We Trust" appear on either the front or back of the coin rather than on the edge. That took effect with coins minted in 2009. Since then, each of the coins in the presidential series has had "In God We Trust" inscribed on the front. (In 2011, the White House stopped circulating new presidential dollar coins, citing large reserves of uncirculated coins; smaller numbers, with "In God We Trust" still on the front, continue to be produced to satisfy demand from collectors.) "In God We Trust" also appears on the front of the Sacagawea and Native American dollars. You can see "In God We Trust" on the presidential, Sacagawea and American Indian dollars. We should note, that it is possible -- though extremely rare -- to find one of the original 2007 coins without the "In God We Trust" side inscription. According to a 2007 Associated Press story, due to what the U.S. Mint called complications in the quality-control process, "an unknown number" of new George Washington dollar coins were mistakenly produced without their edge inscriptions, including "In God We Trust." In a March 2007 press release, the U.S. Mint wrote that these coins were released inadvertently, and that it "understands the importance of the inscriptions 'In God We Trust' and 'E Pluribus Unum,' as well as the mint mark and year on U.S. coinage. An expert who follows coin collecting estimated more than 50,000 coins were mistakenly minted that way. But that was a small fraction of the 300 million coins produced by 2007, and it was not done on purpose. Our ruling As we noted, we are not judging Romney’s comment in Virginia here, since he was not explicitly blaming Obama for the status of "In God We Trust" on money.

pomt-00575	"In New Jersey, Gov. Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-chris-christie-voting-early-voting/	2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton went after Republicans by name for repeatedly restricting voting rights in a policy speech at Texas Southern University on June 4, 2015. She singled out several Republican governors who are also potential presidential candidates. Among them was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who "vetoed legislation to extend early voting," according to Clinton. Christie called Clinton’s accusation "ridiculous," on CBS’s Face the Nation a few days later. "She doesn't know what she's talking about," he said. "The fact is that folks in New Jersey have plenty of an opportunity to vote." Christie has a point that voters in New Jersey could vote before Election Day. But Clinton is right that Christie nixed a plan to "extend" early voting. We’ll explain. Under New Jersey election law, you can vote early through absentee ballot, but that’s not the same thing as early voting, which experts told us typically means casting your ballot in-person at a limited number of polling locations before election day. With absentee voting, Garden State voters can send their ballots via mail or drop it off in person at an election official’s office as early as 45 days before polls open. After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New Jersey witnessed several logistical polling issues around the state on Election Day. So Democratic lawmakers proposed adding the typical in-person early voting option. Under their bill, S2364, a limited amount of polling locations would open for 14 days leading up to Election Day. The New Jersey Legislature passed the bill in March 2013 and sent it to Christie, who threw it out. Christie’s spokesman referred us to his veto message. "This bill risks the integrity and orderly administration of our elections by introducing a new voting method and process," Christie wrote. "Taxpayers should not have to foot a more than $25 million bill to pay for a hasty, counterproductive, and less reliable system, especially when New Jersey’s current early voting process is reliable and cost effective." Christie’s and Clinton’s definitions of early voting differ. And while there’s no legally or universally recognized definition for the term, experts say Clinton’s is more widely used. "Technically, New Jersey voters can vote early, but it's not what early voting systems look like around the country. It looks like the absentee ballot system," said Wendy Weiser, an election law expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. Hans von Spakovsky, an election law expert at the Heritage Foundation, agreed but noted that, in his opinion, "Absentee balloting is actually easier than early voting, since you can do everything from your home." Our ruling Clinton said, "In New Jersey, Gov. Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting." In 2012, state legislators passed a bill that would have added early, in-person voting to New Jersey’s existing absentee ballot mail-in system. While the legislation wouldn’t have extended the time period for early voting, it would have given voters more ways to vote before Election Day. Christie rejected the bill, saying the existing system worked fine. We’re not weighing in here on whether the new system was better, but we do find that Clinton was careful in how she worded her claim. The proposal would have extended early voting, and Christie vetoed it. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-15332	"In the past two years in Congress, I’ve written more bills, passed more amendments on the floor of the House and enacted more of my bills into law than any other member of the House."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/14/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-he-holds-record-passing-bills-an/	Though U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, is perhaps most famous for his colorful language about Republicans, in his campaign for U.S. Senate he wants to portray himself as a politician who gets things done -- even when Republicans are in charge of Congress. On July 9, Grayson announced that he will take on fellow Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Jupiter for the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Grayson repeatedly made claims that he is No. 1 in terms of legislation passed: "In the past two years in Congress, I’ve written more bills, passed more amendments on the floor of the House and enacted more of my bills into law than any other member of the House -- No. 1 out of 435 of us," Grayson said in an announcement video on senatorwithguts.com. Is Grayson No. 1 in introducing bills as well as passing bills and amendments? Introducing bills This part of Grayson’s claim is straightforward: For the most recent, Congress he holds the record for introducing bills. GovTrack, a website which tracks legislation, found that Grayson introduced 96 bills and resolutions during the 113th Congress, a two-year term which ended in January. That placed him at the No. 1 spot. But how many passed? That might sound straightforward, but it isn’t. Passing bills As we have noted before, the number of bills sponsored by a member doesn’t tell the full story about any member’s legislative accomplishments. They can also influence legislation in other ways, such as writing language that gets included in a separate bill, co-sponsoring bills, holding hearings and negotiating agreements. One way to count how many bills a member passed is to look at the number of bills he sponsored and how many of those actual bills were signed into law. Using that method, GovTrack found that zero of Grayson’s bills became law during the 113th Congress. But Grayson counts bills that he sponsored in which the same language was included in separate versions. Using the Congress.gov website, Grayson campaign spokesman Kevin Franck, pointed to 281 pieces of legislation that passed during the 113th Congress. The website showed that Grayson sponsored 10, more than anyone else. But none of those 10 were the actual ones that passed -- instead, other versions passed. And nine of those were ultimately lumped into one bill to amend the IRS tax code to extend tax credits -- for example for energy efficient homes -- or a deduction. The House passed H.R. 5771 378-46 in December 2014. "My hunch is that these provisions would have made their way into the tax extender bill even without Rep. Grayson's bills," George Washington University professor Sarah Binder said. The only bill that didn’t fall into that category was to prohibit an increase in the number of the military's flag and general officers -- the version that passed the House passed 376-5. (Grayson’s staff found two additional bills he passed that didn’t show up in that list of 10 that were lumped into a defense bill at the end of the year.) So are these all meaty bills? Not really. "But sometimes the little stuff matters a lot," Binder said. "And we expect our representatives to care about parochial issues as well. So it strikes me as reasonable when lawmakers take credit for a range of types of issues, whether or not they make the front pages." Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that measuring productivity by the number of bills passed is tricky. "Even writing minor, technical, or routine bills is not the same as participating in crafting major legislation. To give him his due, not very many major bills have passed in recent congresses, but still ... Inflated claim," he said. Amendments A similar search of the Congress.gov website showed that Grayson, as well as U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., tied for first with 21 amendments. Grayson’s amendments covered a range of topics, including funding for the search for a cure for Gulf War illness, for gun locks, and for tax counseling for the elderly. Eight of the amendments aimed to prevent the award of federal contracts to principals convicted of various crimes or who had civil judgments against them. (The passed amendments in his list of 21 doesn’t include about a dozen en-bloc amendments, in which a chairman groups together a bunch of amendments at once.) With the exception of one of the 21 amendments, all of them passed by voice votes suggesting they were not controversial. (The one that reached a vote was to protect journalists from testifying about confidential sources. The amendment passed 225-183 but didn’t make it into the final legislation. Grayson has reintroduced it.) "That said, there are a handful of Grayson amendments that secure recorded votes and then fail, so his floor track record is a bit uneven -- as we might expect for a minority party member," Binder said. For example in June 2013, he had two amendments narrowly fail -- one by one vote, the other by a tie -- on bills related to expanding oil and gas production. His amendment aimed to protect the authority of states to restrict oil drilling off their waters. Ultimately, the vast majority of Grayson amendments that passed did not end up in the final version of bills that became law. One of the 21 amendments and three of the en bloc amendments made it into law, according to Grayson’s office. It seems to be Grayson’s strategy to try to pass as many as possible since he re-joined Congress in 2012. In June, he passed five in one day. "Grayson and his staff scan the bills that come out of the majority," wrote David Weigel in Slate in 2013. "They scan amendments that passed in previous Congresses but died at some point along the way. They resurrect or mold bills that can appeal to the libertarian streak in the GOP, and Grayson lobbies his colleagues personally." Based on our research, it seems like Grayson has worked very hard to pass legislation even though he is in the minority. Another way to look at it is that Grayson is simply trying to get his name on as many bills or amendments as possible. It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about that. Our ruling Grayson said, "In the past two years in Congress, I’ve written more bills, passed more amendments on the floor of the House and enacted more of my bills into law than any other member of the House." It’s true that Grayson is No. 1 in writing bills and resolutions, with 96 in total for the 113th Congress. But Grayson omits some caveats. The 10 bills he sponsored ended up passing as part of other bills, not as stand-alone measures. Of those 10, all but one ultimately landed in the same bill that passed with a fairly wide margin. He had 21 amendments pass, largely on voice votes, which suggests they were not controversial matters. Congressional experts say that the sheer number of bills or amendments written and passed doesn’t tell the full story of a member’s accomplishments. His statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2015-07-14T13:20:19	2015-07-09	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-06543	"A family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy for health insurance" under the new federal health care law.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/05/helen-glover/ri-talk-radio-host-helen-glover-says-new-health-ca/	The overhaul of the nation’s health-care system -- and how Rhode Island is preparing for its impact -- dominated a recent segment of WHJJ-AM's "The Helen Glover Show." Glover's guest was Amy Gallagher, a local benefits consultant with the Cornerstone Group and a member of the health exchange work group of Governor Chafee’s Healthcare Reform Commission. The two were criticizing the federal law, warning that it will be too costly to taxpayers. Glover talked about how when she was younger, she couldn’t afford health insurance but managed to get by -- by tapping her savings to pay for doctor’s bills with cash. "How do we pay for it?" Glover asked about the new health care system and the planned exchanges that are an attempt to provide affordable insurance to the masses. After a commercial break, Glover said that Gallagher "was just telling me that a family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy for health insurance, which of course begs the question, who is paying for that in the long run? We all know that all of us are." We’re not going to delve into a debate about whether the health care law is going to save the country money or cost more by extending coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. But we were curious whether a family with that much income would truly qualify for a federal subsidy. But before we hook up the Truth-O-Meter to Glover’s statement, let’s first revisit the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which President Obama signed into law March 23, 2010. One of its centerpieces is the so-called "individual mandate." Beginning in 2014, most U.S. citizens will be required to obtain health insurance, according to a summary of the law published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an often-cited source of information on health care policy. If they don’t, they’ll face penalties that by 2016 will rise to $695 or 2.5 percent of taxable income for individuals, whichever is greater. Enter the exchanges. Their purpose is to create a marketplace that helps keep costs down by spurring competition between insurers while delivering to them vast numbers of consumers, including younger healthy people, many of whom lack insurance now. Exchanges will be established in every state, with the federal government stepping in to create ones in states that opt not to participate. Rhode Island was moving toward establishing a state-based health-benefits exchange when Gallagher appeared on Glover’s show on Sept. 7. (On Sept. 20, Governor Chafee issued an executive order directing the establishment of an exchange.) Both individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase coverage through exchanges when they open in 2014. While the exchanges are intended to be affordable, it’s expected that plenty of people will still need financial assistance. That’s where the federal subsidies come in. Called "premium tax credits," the subsidies will be offered to income-eligible consumers who purchase insurance through an exchange. The credits will be paid directly to an insurer to help families that might not have the cash to make timely payments. So back to Glover’s statement. Would a family of four making $88,000 a year qualify for the subsidies? The short answer is yes. The guidelines are spelled out clearly in the Kaiser summary, as well as at HealthCare.gov, a Web site of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. They state that taxpayers with household incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level -- $89,400 a year for a family of four in 2011, according to the U.S. Treasury Department -- will be eligible for credits. Families at that level would contribute 9.5 percent of their income -- $8,493 -- to their health insurance premium. The tax credit would cover the remainder. Those with lower incomes would contribute less and get bigger credits. A family at poverty level -- $22,350 for a family of four -- would contribute 2 percent of their income, about $447. The Treasury Department, in an Aug. 12 notice, noted that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that individuals receiving tax credits will get an average subsidy of more than $5,000 per year. Our ruling Glover, quoting a talk show guest, said a family of four with an income of $88,000 would be eligible for a health insurance subsidy. That figure is actually $1,400 below the threshold to receive a subsidy. And it’s in 2011 dollars, meaning that by 2014, when exchanges are scheduled to begin operation, it could be adjusted upward to reflect inflation. While the diagnostic services of our Truth-O-Meter are not covered by any known health plan, we administer them freely. This claim gets a True.

pomt-12519	"After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/apr/24/viral-image/viral-4-20-image-makes-misleading-claim-about-drug/	On Thursday – which was the unofficial stoner holiday of 4/20 – supporters of legal marijuana and opponents of the U.S. "war on drugs" took to the internet to make the case for their causes. One widely shared image made an unexpected implication – that decriminalizing drugs could be a pro-police move. It features images of police destroying liquor bottles and marijuana plants, with this text: "Did you know? More American police officers died during prohibition of alcohol than any other time in history. 300 died in 1930 alone. After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs." A quick Google search showed us the image has been popping up on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other websites – and that it has been making the rounds since at least 2015. The message is clear: When the government bans popular substances, like liquor or marijuana, black market trade makes life more dangerous for those enforcing the ban. We wondered, however, if the data actually supported that message. The war on drugs Marijuana and other drugs had been illegal in the United States for years before the federal government – under President Richard Nixon, as the image correctly states – launched what we now call the "war on drugs." In June 1971 Nixon declared "a full-scale attack on the problem of drug abuse in America." He called for harsher drug laws and millions of dollars in extra spending, and Congress complied. Today, spending on the drug war has continued to grow, and the United States has either the largest or second-largest prison population in the world. Yet marijuana remains popular. A CBS poll released Thursday found 61 percent of Americans favor legalizing pot and 33 percent are opposed. It also found 88 percent of Americans support medical marijuana. A 2015 National Institute on Drug Abuse survey reported that 22.2 million people – 7 percent of the U.S. population – had used pot within the last month. That’s about twice the rate at which people are abusing the second-most popular drug, illicit prescription painkillers (see fact-checks on opioids here, here and here). A deadly job? Comparing Prohibition with the drug war is common in American culture. Just listen to the popular 1988 country song "Copperhead Road" by Steve Earle, about a man from an Appalachian moonshining clan who switches the family business to weed. But is it also fair to compare police deaths during the two periods? That’s a little iffy. It’s correct that 1930 was the deadliest year in U.S. history for police. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officer deaths going back to 1791, says 307 officers died in 1930. It’s also correct that police deaths decreased sharply after Prohibition. But the numbers behind the claim that "police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs" are a bit off. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Nixon began the war on drugs in 1971, but police deaths actually topped 200 the year before that in 1970. And that wasn’t any sort of a spike – the number of deaths had been just below 200 all throughout the late 1960s. And that’s not the only thing wrong with this claim. Not all deaths are violent The image clearly uses the violence associated with organized crime to make its point. However, not every officer who dies in any given year is killed by someone else in the line of duty. Many officers die from car crashes, illnesses and other causes. Yet the data this viral post cites on police deaths includes all deaths of police officers each year – violent and non-violent, on-duty and off-duty. In 2007, according to the memorial group, 202 officers died. According to FBI data, 57 of those officers were killed by a criminal while on duty. That means nearly three-fourths of the deaths that year were not the kind of violent deaths this image is alluding to. And even while on duty that year, an officer was more likely to have been killed in an accident than by a criminal. Fewer police deaths We focused on 2007 for a reason. In the last 36 years, only 2007 and 2001 (due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks) have had more than 200 officer deaths. Yet the typical person who sees this image might very well believe that 200 or more police officers are continuing to die each year during the war on drugs. In reality that’s only happened 12 times, and only twice since 1981. Nicholas Kristof wrote in 2015 that toddlers are killed by guns more often than on-duty police officers are, which PunditFact rated Mostly True. And whatever the cause of officers' deaths in a given period, the war on drugs still doesn’t compare to Prohibition, when for 14 years an average of 252 officers died every year. Since Prohibition ended more than 80 years ago, however, there have been more than 250 officer deaths only twice – in 1973 and 1974. In fact, during most years from the 1990s until today, the number of officer deaths has been roughly the same as 100 years ago, when there were far fewer officers. Our ruling A viral image making the rounds on 4/20 compared the number of police officer deaths during Prohibition to the drug war: "After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs," the image said. Those numbers aren’t totally accurate, and the comparison itself is misleading. For one, it counts many officers' deaths that had nothing to do with the prohibition of drugs or alcohol, like an officer who dies of cancer or in a car crash on vacation. And despite the direct comparison between the deadly years of Prohibition and the war on drugs, police deaths have largely been on the decline for decades even as the drug war continues and the number of officers has grown significantly. Since the image uses a semi-accurate statistic to make a misleading comparison, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09967	Senators who have accepted millions in campaign contributions from the financial industry voted against allowing bankruptcy judges to modify home mortgages.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/12/moveon/moveon-targets-senators-who-opposed-new-bankruptcy/	With record numbers of foreclosures looming, consumer advocates have been hoping Congress would make it easier for people in bankruptcy to have their home mortgages modified. When you declare bankruptcy, you go into federal court and formally admit that you can no longer pay your debts. A judge then takes over to broker agreements between you and the people or businesses you owe. Federal or state laws can govern the bankruptcy process, and rules differ by state. But under federal rules, judges can't change the terms of a home mortgage. They can, however, modify the terms of any mortgage that is not a primary residence, such as vacation homes. Critics of the rule say it is unfair to people of more modest means, and that the rules should allow judges to lower the principal, cut interest rates or extend the terms of repayment. Measures allowing these things are known as "cramdown" legislation, because they typically force the lender to reduce the debt. The financial industry has opposed the measure because they say it will cost the banks money, and they will be required to raise interest rates on new mortgage customers. The Senate voted against cramdown legislation on April 30, 2009, killing an amendment on a 45-51 vote. President Barack Obama supported the legislation. The liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org has created advertisements targeting seven Democratic senators who voted against the legislation, which it calls "commonsense bankruptcy reform." The ads are virtually identical. Here's the script for the ad about Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. (Specter recently switched parties and was a Democrat at the time of the vote.) "Last week, Sen. Specter had a choice. Wall Street was trying to kill the president's proposal to help families facing foreclosure. Sen. Specter could side with the banks, or with Pennsylvania families. Sen. Specter has taken close to $6 million from the financial industry. So what did he do? Exactly what the banks wanted. And now millions of people will lose their homes because of it. Tell Sen. Specter to stand up for us — not the banks." We wanted to check MoveOn's math about what the senators had collected from the financial industry. We turned to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign contributions. Here's the list of senators that MoveOn targeted, what MoveOn said they raised from the financial industry, and what the Center for Responsive Politics showed: • Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa. — "close to $6 million" — career total: $5,753,310 • Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. — "close to $3 million" — career total: $3,020,966 • Sen. Ben Nelson, D.-Neb. — "close to $3 million" — career total: $2,667,406 • Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. — "close to $2 million" — career total: $2,160,628 • Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark. — "close to $2 million" — career total: $1,671,292 • Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. — "close to $2 million" — career total: $2,399,134 • Sen. Mark Pryor, D. Ark. — "close to $1 million" — career total: $1,321,948 The category is for "Finance, Insurance and Real Estate," and that includes the following types of businesses: commercial banks, savings and loans, credit unions, finance/credit companies, securities and investment, venture capital, hedge funds, private equity and investment firms, insurance, real estate, mortgage bankers and brokers, and accountants. We should note here that five other Democrats voted against the measure but were not targeted by MoveOn. A representative for MoveOn told us that those senators had either accepted less money from the financial industry or had a better overall voting record on MoveOn's core issues. Those senators included: Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.; and Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. Getting back to the ads, MoveOn says the senators voted with Wall Street and the banks after accepting campaign contributions from them. We can't say if there is a cause and effect, but MoveOn is right about how the senators voted. MoveOn approximates numbers for the campaign contributions — and clearly labels them approximations — and those numbers closely track the actual data from the Center for Responsive Politics. We rule MoveOn's collective statement that senators accepted millions in campaign contributions and voted against cramdown legislation as True.

pomt-01450	New jobs numbers are in, and Wisconsin has "fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/03/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-last-midwest-job-growth-/	A new TV ad from Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke plows some familiar ground, arguing that Wisconsin is heading in the wrong direction in terms of job creation. The ad began airing Sept. 23, 2014, several days after the latest set of jobs numbers were issued. It opens with a narrator saying "It’s happened again. The new August jobs numbers are out, and Wisconsin lost another 4,300 jobs." The narrator then cites Gov. Scott Walker’s now-unreachable pledge to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, criticizes "tax cuts to the wealthy" and cuts to education, and continues with a claim that has become a Burke campaign mantra: "And we’ve fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth." The ad meshes together two batches of jobs data that were released Sept. 18, 2014. The first is an initial estimate of monthly performance for August 2014, based on numbers that can fluctuate widely because they are based on a small sample of employers. The second is the more accurate quarterly numbers, this batch covering the first three months of 2014. We have been here before. Sort of. On Aug. 31, 2014, we rated True a claim from a Burke TV ad that "Wisconsin’s dead last in Midwest job growth." At the time, the most recent quarterly numbers went to the end of 2013, so they matched quite nicely with the first three years of Walker’s term. But, as the calendar changed, so did the numbers. In the first ad, Burke used a footnote on the screen to bolster her claim. In this one, the fine print illustrates how she has subtly shifted the time frame to her advantage. And the way the August drop is juxtaposed with the "dead last" language further confuses the matter. In short, the otherwise accurate numbers reach a conclusion that’s greater than the sum of their parts. Time frame Let’s start with the first ad. As noted, it relied on numbers that covered Walker’s full first three years in office. In that time frame, Wisconsin was indeed last among other Midwest states. What’s more, Wisconsin also ranked last if you looked strictly at the most recent one-year period. So, the short-term view and the long-term one matched. We felt Burke had used a fair approach and we rated the claim True. This time, there is a critical difference. In her latest ad, Burke shifts the time frame and in doing so loses track of Walker’s term. This time, the footnote says the claim is based on numbers that compare March 2011 to March 2014. Burke’s campaign points out that this data is the most recent available and that you cannot combine full-year with partial-year data. And that in the window from March 2011 to March 2014 Wisconsin does rank last in the Midwest. True enough. But that timeframe does not correspond well with anything. It misses entirely the first three months of Walker’s term. What’s more, it masks an important fact. When reviewing economic data, a common yardstick is to examine year-over-year performance to gauge trends. And in that 12-month time frame -- March 2013 to March 2014 -- Wisconsin no longer ranks "dead last" in the Midwest. We’ve climbed out of the cellar, past Illinois and Minnesota, and rank eighth of 10 states. A modest improvement, to be sure. But an improvement. When asked about the claim, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said: "While it is true that we rank 8th out of 10 Midwestern states from March 2013 to March 2014, we clearly indicated in the ad that we are using the time period that better reflects the Governor's full term in office, not just the last year." But it doesn’t accurately reflect the governor’s full time in office. And it strikes us not as an effort to be most current, but a clever way to maintain a powerful talking point. Consider: When the next set of quarterly data comes out, it will cover the quarter that ends in June 2014. Using Burke’s approach would lop off the first six months of Walker’s term. In the quarter after that, the first nine months would be gone. What’s more, the ad co-mingles monthly and quarterly data in a way that helps obscure the recent improvement. And its verbiage also serves to confuse viewers. The narrator cites the preliminary August jobs count, which did show a drop of 4,300 from the previous month. But when combined with the language used -- "And we’ve fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth" -- it suggests that falling to the bottom is a new development. For the first three years of Walker’s term, Wisconsin did rank last in the Midwest -- both for the three years as a whole, and in each of the individual years.That’s a true statement, and we have rated it as such. But while the calendar moved ahead, this claim from Burke has remained stuck in the past. In the last 12-month period that can be analyzed, the period economists most typically measure, Wisconsin moved out of the cellar. Finally, it’s worth noting that since this ad was first aired, the Burke campaign has turned to another ad that has a variation of this claim. In that ad, she defends copying parts of her jobs plan by suggesting if Walker had borrowed good ideas from other states "maybe we wouldn’t be dead last in Midwest jobs growth." However, this time there isn’t even a footnote. Our rating Burke’s ad renews the claim that Wisconsin rates last in the Midwest in terms of job creation. She’s arrives at that conclusion by citing accurate data, but by using an unconventional shift in the time frame to make her point. The ad also ignores the most recent 12-month performance -- a common yardstick for economists -- that says Wisconsin’s performance improved and was better than two other Midwest states. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08107	"Sixteen [federal] programs exist to fight homelessness" and some of them are duplicative.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/13/jack-kingston/congressman-asks-how-many-federal-programs-does-it/	Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston wanted to be the guy to watch your tax dollars in Washington. The Savannah Republican recently made an unsuccessful bid to chair the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees the distribution of federal funds. It's considered one of the most powerful positions in Washington. Republican House leaders voted in favor of Kentucky's Harold Rogers. Kingston put together an 18-page presentation to make his case for the job. It was full of charts and numbers and graphs and a bandaged pig to illustrate the representative's big point -- that Washington's finances are being mismanaged, and Kingston had some conservative and innovative ideas to straighten things out. The presentation also included some numbers listed as "facts" that made us curious: There are 16 programs to combat homelessness. It was listed under the headline "end duplicative programs." Since fact-checking is our business, AJC PolitiFact Georgia couldn't pass this one up. Were there that many federal programs out there to help the homeless? And are they duplicative? The congressman's office told us their numbers came from U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma. Kingston's spokesman, Chris Crawford, said they believe federal efforts to help the homeless should be under one department, not the myriad of agencies that currently have programs to assist those without permanent shelter. "Why are we duplicating the efforts so much?" Crawford asked. "Is there something that could be done to consolidate services?" In 1987, Congress created the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness to lead the federal government's efforts to aid homeless individuals and families. The agency's spokesman, Jason Kravitz, forwarded us its fiscal year 2009 report, which was released in April 2010. The ICH includes 19 federal departments and agencies, ranging from Health and Human Services to the Defense Department. Kravitz said part of the ICH's mission since Barack Obama became president has been to "break down the silos" that some say exist among the various government agencies. Kravitz said there has been concerns that some federal agencies were unaware of what others were doing to help the homeless. So does that mean there's duplication? "Some [of the programs] target youth. Some target the mentally ill. Some target families," answered Sharon Price, the ICH's deputy director for policy. We reviewed the FY 2009 report and found 27 federal programs to help the homeless. The programs cost at least $1.2 billion. The greatest number of them, eight, are within the Department of Veterans Affairs. One program is aimed at reintegrating homeless veterans back into society, another provides health care, one offers dental care, and another identifies and coordinates services. Within Veterans Affairs, we found a Compensated Work Theory that, according to the FY 2009 report, "endeavors to match and support work-ready veterans in competitive jobs, and to consult business and industry regarding their specific employment needs." The VA budgeted $26.6 million toward that program. The Labor Department has a Veterans' Reintegration Program, which is "the only nationwide program exclusively focused on assisting homeless veterans reintegrate into the workforce." Its budget was $26.3 million. The federal Health and Human Services Department has two programs that, in part, try to assist homeless people with mental health issues. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has a Supportive Housing program that has a component that works with people with severe mental illness. HUD's Shelter Care program also works with people who are "seriously mentally ill." Additionally, there's an Emergency Food and Shelter program and Emergency Shelter grants. Steve Berg, vice president of programs and policy for the Washington, D.C.-based National Alliance to End Homelessness, is familiar with virtually every federal program for the homeless. The programs, he said, are different. Berg did say some have "similar functions," like the Emergency Food and Shelter program and Emergency Shelter grants. He noted that the grants go to state and local government, while the Food and Shelter program funding goes to large nonprofit organizations. Indeed, local governments can manage how the grants are used. Berg said it is "highly unlikely" that one person would get the same service from different programs. Berg said some programs, like PATH, focus on implementing initiatives to help the homeless, while Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals center on finding best practices to aid homeless Americans. "There are reasons why each [program] exists," Berg said. In summary, we found more federal programs aimed at helping the homeless than Kingston did. Some of the programs do share the same goals, although Berg noted there are some differences in who gets the funding and how they get used. We believe Kingston's statement is accurate, but more information shows there are some differences in about all of these programs. Kingston may not have gotten the assignment he wanted, but the congressman gets a pretty high mark on our rating system, Mostly True.

pomt-04828	Says "about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/16/lou-greenwald/lou-greenwald-claims-new-jersey-students-represent/	New Jersey shells out nearly the most in the country to educate its public school students. But, in at least one area, the yield on that investment is lackluster: more residents leave New Jersey to attend college than in any other state, according to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald. When asked about a November bond referendum for construction at state colleges in an Aug. 9 interview with the liberal blog Blue Jersey, Greenwald, a South Jersey Democrat, said the focus should be on "how do we keep our best and brightest students here in New Jersey." "We spend more on public education, kindergarten to 12th grade, than any other state in the country yet we have the highest exodus of graduating high school seniors who are more than qualified to go to the schools that we have here in the state," Greenwald said. "We just don't have the capacity. A lot of that has helped drive up costs. So the capital construction to expand access for New Jersey residents is critically important. If you think about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount." Do New Jerseyans really represent nearly a third of all students across the country who go to an out-of-state school? Statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, highlight a major flaw in Greenwald’s statement: far more than 100,000 students nationwide pursue a postsecondary education at an out-of-state institution. In fall 2010 -- the most recent data available -- more than 515,000 freshmen across the country started college at an out-of-state school. Nearly 393,000 of those students finished high school in the previous year. So Greenwald scores no points for accuracy there. Brian McGinnis, Greenwald’s communications director, said we were "missing the forest for the trees." "There’s a serious brain drain that’s disproportionately happening in New Jersey," he said, adding that Greenwald’s overall point -- that New Jersey "sends more homegrown students out of state than any other state" -- was correct. Nearly 35,000 New Jerseyans left home to attend college for the first time in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 31,000 finished high school the previous year. No other state had a larger amount of students in either group attend out-of-state schools, but California and New York -- two states with significantly larger populations -- weren’t far behind. More than 34,500 students -- nearly 28,300 of whom recently finished high school -- left California for college in fall 2010. In New York, more than 33,900 students left the state for school in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 28,600 were graduated from high school in the previous year. Greenwald was comparing the amount of New Jerseyans who leave the state for college to a nationwide figure, but it’s worth nothing that as a percentage -- a "more accurate barometer" for comparing states according to Joseph Stetar, a professor of education at Seton Hall University -- four other states send more students out-of-state for college. A larger percentage of all first-time freshman students in Alaska, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont attended college outside of their home state than New Jersey in fall 2010. Our ruling Greenwald said "about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount." Roughly 30,000 recent high school graduates left New Jersey to attend an out-of-state college, according to federal data. That part of Greenwald’s claim is true. But far more than 100,000 students attend out-of-state schools and though New Jersey students represented the largest portion of that group, California and New York followed closely behind. So we rate this statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Lou Greenwald	None	None	None	2012-08-16T07:30:00	2012-08-09	['New_Jersey']

The Australian Constitution does not prevent dual citizens from sitting as High Court judges. Under the constitution, justices of the High Court are appointed by the governor-general in council, effectively the government of the day. The sole constitutional restriction is that a justice has to retire when they turn 70, and cannot be appointed if they are 70 or over. A Commonwealth law – the High Court Act 1979 – adds that to be eligible for appointment, a justice has to have been a judge of a Commonwealth, state or territory court (other than the Local Court of the Northern Territory) or an Australian barrister or solicitor for at least five years. The prohibition on dual citizenship for federal politicians could be seen as a unique aspect of the Australian system. Dual citizens are able to sit in state and territory parliaments, subject to some exceptions for people who obtain foreign citizenship while in parliament.

pomt-09362	On recess appointments.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/01/barack-obama/obama-recess-appointment-craig-becker-bush-john-bo/	With Congress in recess after passing major health care legislation, President Barack Obama took the opportunity to install several of his appointees without receiving approval from the Senate. The move is known as a "recess appointment," and it stems from a power enumerated in the U.S. Constitution, which states, "The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session." That means Obama can make the appointments now, and those appointees will be able to serve until the end of 2011. Other presidents have made recess appointments, both recently and throughout history, and those appointments have regularly drawn criticism from the opposite party. We remembered that Obama, while serving as a U.S. senator, opposed the recess appointment of John Bolton, President George W. Bush's pick to become U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. So we decided to test Obama on the Flip-O-Meter to see whether his decision to make recess appointments represents a change in position. We'll start with the 2005 Bolton appointment, and then compare it with what Obama did in 2010. President George W. Bush appointed Bolton to be ambassador of the United Nations after senators held up the confirmation in two separate votes of 56-42 and 54-38. The nomination required 60 votes before formal approval. Opponents said Bolton was the wrong person for the job because he was known as a critic of the United Nations. Democrats said that history made him poor choice to become ambassador to the organization. But Democrats were also angry that Bolton had submitted inaccurate information to the Senate. The State Department inspector general had interviewed Bolton about the accuracy of intelligence leading up to the Iraq war, but Bolton had submitted testimony indicating that he had not been interviewed. That dispute prompted Senate Democrats to send a letter to Bush protesting the recess appointment. Obama was one of 36 senators to sign the letter. (Joe Biden, now Obama's vice president, and Hillary Clinton, Obama's secretary of state, signed it as well.) "In light of the fact that John Bolton was not truthful to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the questionnaire he swore was truthful, we ask that you do not make a recess appointment of Mr. Bolton to be the Ambassador to the United Nations, and instead submit a new nomination to the Senate," the letter said. "Mr. Bolton's excuse that he 'didn't recall being interviewed by the State Department's Inspector General' is simply not believable. "Sending someone to the United Nations who has not been confirmed by the United States Senate and now who has admitted to not being truthful on a document so important that it requires a sworn affidavit is going to set our efforts back in many ways," the letter said. Obama, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Chicago Tribune, "To some degree, he's damaged goods," adding, "I think that means we'll have less credibility and, ironically, be less equipped to reform the United Nations in the way that it needs to be reformed." But Obama also said that he thought Bush was within his rights in making the appointment. "The president is entitled to take that action, but I don't think it will serve American foreign policy well," Obama said in an interview. Obama issued his own separate statement on the Bolton nomination after the recess appointment. He offered strong words of criticism -- "John Bolton is the wrong person for the job and the decision to appoint him today will not serve American foreign policy well at all" -- but the future president did not complain in his statement that it was a recess appointment. In fact, he didn't even mention it. In making his recess appointments on March 27, 2010, Obama said he was moving forward on nominees in the face of Republican intransigence. "The United States Senate has the responsibility to approve or disapprove of my nominees. But if, in the interest of scoring political points, Republicans in the Senate refuse to exercise that responsibility, I must act in the interest of the American people and exercise my authority to fill these positions on an interim basis," Obama said in a statement. "Most of the men and women whose appointments I am announcing today were approved by Senate committees months ago, yet still await a vote of the Senate. ... I simply cannot allow partisan politics to stand in the way of the basic functioning of government." One of his 15 recess appointments likely wouldn't meet that criteria. In February, 33 senators voted to block the nomination of Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board with only 52 -- short of the 60 needed -- voting to proceed. Becker is an attorney who previously worked for the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO, unions that strongly supported his nomination. Senators critical of labor unions opposed Becker's nomination because they said he would favor unions on the National Labor Relations Board, which is responsible for resolving labor-management disputes. "Parties before the Board, whether union or employer, have a right to a fair and impartial tribunal," said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, in February. "The confirmation of an officer and associate general counsel of two of our nation's largest unions for a term on the National Labor Relations Board will make the appearance of justice and many of the decisions in which he participates impossible to achieve." McCain said he feared Becker would promote the policy known as "card check," which makes it easier for unions to organize using signed authorization cards rather than a secret ballot. Critics say that card check makes it easier for unions to intimidate workers into joining, but unions say that it helps workers to sidestep management efforts to suppress unions. So where does that leave us on the Flip-O-Meter? Obama opposed a controversial recess nomination in 2005 but put forward his own in 2010. Keeping in mind the statement Obama put out on Bolton, it's worth noting that Obama opposed Bolton on his merits, but didn't complain about it being a recess appointment. Indeed, Obama specifically said Bush was within his rights to make the nomination, just as Obama as president now has the right to make recess appointments. On the other hand, Obama did sign on to a group letter that urged Bush to "submit a new nomination to the Senate" rather than go forward with a controversial recess appointment. If every appointee for whom Obama made a recess appointment was noncontroversial, Obama would have a good argument that the two situations were different. But just as Democrats opposed Bolton on policy grounds, so too are Republicans opposing Becker on policy grounds. While Democrats raised issues of personal honesty in the case of Bolton -- accusations that Republicans have not leveled at Becker -- we think the cases are similar enough to make Obama's recess appointment for Becker a Half Flip.

pomt-06114	Says there were only "about eight or 10" inflammatory sentences in his newsletters.	false	/texas/statements/2011/dec/30/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-newsletters-contained-only-eight-or-/	As the buzz surrounding Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul continues to grow heading into the Jan. 3, 2011, caucuses in Iowa, media reports have renewed national scrutiny of controversial passages in newsletters that were published under his name from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. Material in the letters has been described as racist, anti-gay and anti-Israel. Questioned Dec. 29, 2011, by a caller on an Iowa radio talk show, the longtime Republican congressman from Texas said that he wrote pieces on economics for the newsletters but that "there were many times" he didn’t edit the entire letters and that he didn't know about the most incendiary passages until years later. "These were sentences that were put in," Paul said during the interview on WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa. "I think there was a total of about eight or 10 sentences. And it was bad stuff, and it wasn't a reflection of my views at all." Later in the interview, Paul elaborated: "I actually put a type of a newsletter out — it was a Freedom Report, an Investment Letter, Survival Report, different ways — every month since 1976. This is probably 10 sentences out of, you know, 10,000 pages, for all I know. I think it's bad that it happened, but I disavowed all these views." We wondered whether Paul was right that the sentences at issue numbered only eight or 10. First, some background: This is not the first time that Paul has been questioned about the content of his newsletters, which also became an issue in his 1996 U.S. House race and when he ran for president in 2008. In January of that year, the New Republic magazine published a lengthy article on Paul and the newsletters. At the time, it also posted online excerpts from the newsletters, which had such names as Ron Paul’s Freedom Report, Ron Paul Political Report and The Ron Paul Survival Report. When questioned this year about the controversial passages in the newsletters, Paul has repeatedly disavowed them, saying that he didn't write them and didn't review them before they appeared in the newsletters. He has also described himself as a negligent publisher, saying that he should have paid more attention to the newsletters' content. The New Republic reported that some of the letters were published by the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education, a nonprofit that Paul founded in 1976, while others were published by a now-defunct company called Ron Paul & Associates, which also produced a monthly publication called The Ron Paul Investment Letter, according to the article. Although the several dozen pages that The New Republic posted online, dated between 1988 and 1996, represent only a selected sample of Paul's newsletters, we reviewed them and found at least 35 sentences in at least 14 passages over nine different newsletters that we think many people would find inflammatory, although we recognize that opinions about specific passages will differ. Several entire items, ranging from a few paragraphs to an entire "Special Issue on Racial Terrorism," would probably fit the bill. Click here for our analysis of the documents. The documents sling a range of conspiracy allegations about topics from government control to financial collapse. Several items are anti-homosexual and anti-black; these, as recent news accounts have reported, include a description of the national Martin Luther King Jr. holiday as "Hate Whitey Day" and a statement that during the riots after the 1992 Rodney King verdict, "order was only restored in L.A. when it was time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks." Other examples of inflammatory remarks: A newsletter excerpt that The New Republic listed as being from October 1992 describes "urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos," and an item on AIDS reportedly from a September 1994 newsletter mentions the danger of being infected by "a malicious gay." Our ruling Paul says the newsletters that bore his name contained only eight to 10 sentences of "bad stuff." Although "bad stuff" is in the eye of the beholder, we found nearly three dozen sentences that we think many would find inflammatory — and that's just in the excerpts we had access to.

pomt-01487	"Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-tax-cuts-amount-322-average-fami/	Engaged in a tight re-election duel with Democrat Mary Burke, Gov. Scott Walker is returning to a theme that’s been a constant in his career. Tax cuts. In a new TV ad, the first-term Republican governor peers into the camera and declares: "Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend." Walker then asks: "What are you going to do with your savings?" A series of regular-lookin’ folks enthusiastically answer: Buy clothes and school supplies, buy 96 gallons of gas, new truck tires, 2,700 diapers. Burke has criticized Walker’s tax cuts as tilted to the rich. We rated Half True her claim that Walker cut "taxes for the wealthiest" and raised taxes "on 140,000 Wisconsin families." That claim left out important information, namely that Walker has also cut income taxes across the board. So, what about Walker’s claim of $322 in savings for an "average family." When we asked Walker spokesman Tom Evenson for back up for the $322 figure, he pointed to a series of income tax cuts and property tax relief policies enacted by Walker and GOP lawmakers. Evensen said the figure is based on an "average family" as having four people and a median household income of $81,000. The time frame for the claimed savings, he said, is the 2014 tax year. U.S. Census figures show that a family of four in Wisconsin has a median income of that amount, or slightly higher. A family of four is a common measuring stick. About one in five family households in Wisconsin is that size. But according to the census bureau, a family of two is much more common, making up almost half of those households. There are also more three-person households than four-person ones. More notably, we found the median income across all family sizes in Wisconsin is lower than what Walker used -- $65,618. Because it’s a broader figure, it’s arguably a more representative "average family" income. "To figure out a typical tax cut for a typical Wisconsin family, the $65,618 figure would be the income figure to use, said Tamarine Cornelius, analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. Let’s see how this plays out under both scenarios. We’ll break our calculations into the two major parts -- property taxes and income taxes. Property taxes Special injections of state property tax relief provided in the form of aid to schools and technical colleges helped drop the property tax bill for a median-valued home taxed at statewide average rates. That hypothetical, "average" property owner will see a decrease of $151 on the 2014 property tax bill compared to what they would have without the relief measures, according to estimates from the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Not every family at the average income level will see that savings. For one thing, not every family owns a home or property. And while the Fiscal Bureau estimate is widely cited by both parties as an illustration of changes in property taxes statewide, the bottom line on tax changes can vary widely depending on a variety of factors at the municipal level. Income taxes Using Walker’s "average family" income figure of $81,000, the income tax cuts enacted under Walker would top $200 in 2014, based on our reading of the Fiscal Bureau’s analysis of two income tax rate reductions enacted under Walker. At the $65,618 income figure, the average tax owed would drop more than $185. Bottom line Combining the two types of tax cuts shows a reduction of more than $330 in 2014 for a property-owning family at the median income level for Wisconsin families. Using the higher "average family" income for four people -- the one cited by Walker -- pushes the average savings over $350. Either way, the figures support the ad’s claim of $322. Our rating Walker tells TV viewers that "Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend." Using some solid sources, the governor accurately pegs the combined estimated savings for a median-income family from his income- and property-tax cuts. The claim needs clarification, though, because not every average family is in circumstances to receive a cut of that size, particularly if they are not property owners. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02389	President Barack Obama shut down NASA space flights and turned the agency "into a Muslim outreach department."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/12/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-barack-obama-turned-nasa-muslim/	During an epic rant about liberal laziness and the events in Ukraine, conservative radio pundit Rush Limbaugh made a striking claim about NASA’s new role under President Barack Obama. How liberal laziness, Ukraine and NASA are related is a bit convoluted, so we’ll keep this recap short and sweet. Limbaugh was going off on a Huffington Post blog written by Carolyn Gregoire. In her post, Gregoire criticized a Cadillac commercial as over-materialistic. Here’s what Limbaugh said on his March 6 show: "Hey, Ms. Gregoire, never mind that Barack Obama made NASA into a Muslim outreach department and it's Barack Obama, your idol and hero, that makes it necessary to pay the Russians $70 million for every astronaut to the space station," Limbaugh said. "By the way, with this thing in the Ukraine, with the KGB vs. Obama, i.e., ACORN, what happens if Putin says, ‘You know what, you really ticked me off and I'm not taking you back to your space station.’ How we gonna get there, Ms. Gregoire? 'Cause Obama's shut it down. NASA's a museum for Muslim outreach now." There’s obviously some hyperbole in Limbaugh’s comments here. But we did think it worthy to attempt to answer two questions: What is Limbaugh talking about when he says Obama turned NASA "into a Muslim outreach department?" Did Obama shut down NASA space flights? The Muslim museum connection Limbaugh did not return a request for comment. But we’re fairly certain the origin of his "Muslim outreach" claim stems from the summer 2010 news cycle. New NASA chief Charles Bolden made a curious remark about Obama’s three-pronged vision for Bolden’s job description in an interview with Middle Eastern news channel Al Jazeera. Obama had made improving relations with the Middle East a priority in his first campaign and traveled to Egypt for an historic address to the Muslim world in July 2009. To commemorate the one-year anniversary of that speech, Bolden told Al Jazeera the following in Cairo (video): "When I became the NASA administrator, (President Obama) charged me with three things. One, he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math; he wanted me to expand our international relationships; and third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering." Months earlier, Bolden brought up NASA’s goal of working with "non-traditional" allies, such as Indonesia, in a talk with engineering students, according to the Orlando Sentinel. We wanted to know what other ground Bolden covered during the Al Jazeera interview, but we could not find a full-length transcript and video. So we turned to other recaps. A 2010 PolitiFact Texas fact-check on this topic pointed out Bolden also spoke of NASA’s focus on international exploration of deep space and using robots to knock human race-threatening asteroids away from Earth. An ABC News synopsis said Bolden said his mission was not about diplomacy but expanding international relationships for "tangible reasons," such as traveling to Mars. Still, Bolden’s comment about reaching out to Muslim nations struck conservative talking heads and politicians as bizarre. Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer said Bolden’s remarks signaled "a new height of fatuousness." Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, who served during the George W. Bush administration, called it a "perversion" of NASA’s purpose. Limbaugh was mad back then, too. The White House clarified Bolden’s remarks as outrage swelled, with spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, "That was not his task, and that's not the task of NASA." A NASA spokesman told PolitiFact Texas in a previous fact-check, "NASA’s core mission remains one of space exploration, science and aeronautics. Administrator Bolden regrets that a statement he made during a recent interview mischaracterized that core mission. The success of NASA’s efforts is increasingly enhanced by mutual cooperation with dozens of other countries around the world that are also committed to these efforts." In the years since, Bolden has traveled around the world promoting NASA but has not made many public statements. "He misspoke a bit and has since then had a fairly tight leash put on him by the White House," said John Logsdon, space historian at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, in an interview with PunditFact. Obama did not want Bolden to extend NASA’s cooperation to solely Muslim countries, Logsdon said, but also to non-traditional countries in South America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The American space program could be "an instrument of political goodwill" and help developing countries get involved with modern space activities, Logsdon said. We reached out to NASA for examples of collaboration with Middle Eastern countries since Bolden took over, and about Limbaugh’s characterization of Bolden’s remarks in general, but a spokesman did not answer those questions. The end of NASA’s space shuttle program The retirement of the 30-year-old space shuttle program may have happened under Obama’s watch, but the process was triggered during the administration of President George W. Bush. In 2004, Bush called for retiring the space shuttle once the International Space Station was complete. (PolitiFact looked at the origins of the phase-out of the American space shuttle program in this fact-check.) NASA retired its space shuttle fleet after the final flight for the space shuttle Atlantis in July 2011. The goal after that was to have a commercial spaceship to carry American astronauts by 2015. In the interim, NASA is paying for seats aboard Russia’s Soyuz space capsules for missions to the International Space Station. Other countries, like Japan and Canada, have reached the space station via Soyuz capsules, too. That arrangement will continue for NASA through 2017. Part of the reason for the delay is that Congress has underfunded Obama’s recent budget requests to help private companies develop their own space technology, according to Space.com, a space and astronomy news website. Regardless, one thing is clear: NASA is not closed for business. The agency has a $17 billion budget and is spending it, Logsdon said. There are satellites en route to Pluto and Jupiter, a rover on the surface of Mars, and work being done on the successor to the Hubble space telescope, he said. NASA spokesman David Weaver said the agency is working on a plan to launch American astronauts to the space station and not rely on Russian transport, but Congress needs to fund Obama’s budget requests. Our ruling Limbaugh reached into the early flare-ups of the Obama presidency for his quip about NASA’s conversion into a "Muslim outreach department." The notion stems from remarks by Bolden in an interview with an Arabic TV channel in 2010. Bolden identified three priorities from Obama, including finding "a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering." The Obama White House refuted Bolden’s remarks once outrage swelled, with spokespeople emphasizing the agency’s mission is space exploration and not diplomacy. Limbaugh also accused Obama of shutting down NASA space flights. Obama certainly played a role (the shuttle flights stopped while he was in office), but the plan to scuttle the space shuttle program started before Obama took office, and Congress has not fully funded budget requests to speed along the creation of a private American space fleet. Those omissions go beyond the realm of hyperbole. We rate Limbaugh’s claim False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2014-03-12T18:10:48	2014-03-06	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-12459	"Clinton Foundation ordered to cease operations – Chelsea (Clinton) charged with fraud!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/09/blog-posting/chelsea-clinton-charged-fraud-clinton-foundation-s/	A fake news story that reads like a page out of conspiracy theory Mad Libs said that Chelsea Clinton was charged with essentially stealing from the Clinton Foundation, which had been ordered to shut down. "Clinton Foundation ordered to cease operations – Chelsea charged with fraud!" read the headline on a May 3, 2017, post on Liberty-Courier.com. The post was flagged as being potentially fake by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from user feeds. Among the numerous allegations made in the post, it said Chelsea Clinton was CEO of the Foundation (that would currently be Kevin Thurm; Chelsea is vice chair). The foundation had been told to stop operating, although the post didn’t say who or what made such a demand. For the record, Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra said the post is definitely incorrect. The story is full of falsehoods and paranoid nonsense, the details of which are almost certainly deliberately inane. For example, one passage reads: "During (Hillary) Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, it’s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with the creator of ISIS and Osama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories. "Bin Laden, who trained the 9/11 terrorists, was then sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death. Documents linking the Clinton Foundation directly to General George Hammond of SG Command were the final piece of the puzzle." For the record, Gen. George Hammond was the one-time leader of the fictional Stargate Command. We also highly doubt Osama bin Laden and Hillary Clinton went toe-to-toe over Scattergories at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The fake post then focuses on how Chelsea Clinton supposedly "used her family foundation’s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents." We found several examples of this story online, most of which appeared to point back to the same May 3 post at USAPoliticsToday.com. The only source cited in that story was a Nov. 6, 2016, article from the New York Post. That article said there was evidence from WikiLeaks’ hack of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails that Chelsea Clinton had taken money from the foundation to pay in part for her 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker had examined that same claim in January 2017, noting that the New York Post was the only U.S. newspaper to run the story, which was picked up by British tabloids and right-leaning news outlets like Fox News. "Despite the breathless reporting, it’s hard to tell exactly what is going on in the email exchange, which is dated Jan. 4, 2012," the Post’s Glenn Kessler wrote. "There is no mention of actual Foundation monies being used for the wedding." Chelsea Clinton herself has decried how the Clinton Foundation has been a target of fake news outlets and conspiracy theorists. "The lies were absolutely frustrating because the facts didn’t seem sufficient to put them to rest," she told Variety magazine in April. "I think that was so odd about the whole experience — either the truth was insufficient or people just didn’t care." In any event, Chelsea Clinton remains free, and the Clinton Foundation is still open for business. We rate this headline Pants On Fire!

pomt-13710	"In 2009, his first year as mayor," Julián Castro "received a seven-figure referral fee" that smells like a dirty financial gift "from notorious personal injury lawyer Mikal Watts, a major Obama donor."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/jul/28/matt-mackowiak/mostly-false-claim-texas-mayor-julian-castro-got-b/	San Antonio golden boy Julián Castro shot to national attention as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton. Among observers, Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak, former vice chair of the Travis County Republican Party, wrote that Texas would be proud to have one of its own (even a Democrat) again serving as vice president. Then again, Mackowiak called the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former mayor of the Alamo City "unquestionably unqualified." "Perhaps most seriously," Mackowiak said in a July 2016 commentary published in the Austin American-Statesman before Castro fell out of consideration, "how Castro earned a living while serving as mayor will come under intense scrutiny. In 2009, his first year as mayor, Castro received a seven-figure referral fee from notorious personal injury lawyer Mikal Watts, a major Obama donor. What Castro did to earn this fee, which smells like a dirty financial gift from a wealthy trial lawyer to a sitting elected official, will receive a lot of attention — especially since Watts was indicted on federal fraud charges in 2015." That sounds call-the-authorities seamy. We sought to check the facts, confirming that Castro, who is a lawyer, once received a reportedly substantial referral fee from Watts. But the matter played out when Castro was in private practice, a couple years before he became mayor. Castro and Watts Timeline: Castro served as mayor of San Antonio from 2009 until 2014 when President Barack Obama picked him to join his cabinet. Prior to 2009, Castro was a San Antonio City Council member from 2001 to 2005, the year he lost his first bid for mayor to Phil Hardberger. It was after that loss that Castro worked as a trial lawyer in private practice and, news stories state, referred a client to Watts, a well-known San Antonio personal-injury lawyer. More recently, as Mackowiak wrote, Watts was indicted for allegedly faking the number of clients he represented with claims against BP Oil after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, according to an Oct. 21, 2015, San Antonio Express-News article, with some counts later dropped. Watts also has been a major Democratic donor. A Nov. 5, 2008, Wall Street Journal news article says 10 partners, including Watts, raised $285,000 for Obama during this first run, with Watts personally contributing $28,500. The newspaper classified Watts as a "mega-bundler." (Bundlers for candidates are people who reach their individual contribution caps and then look to others to write checks to candidates, generating a big bundle.) In 2012, Watts was listed as an Obama bundler by Open Secrets, the website run by the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks federal campaign contributions. According to the Express-News story, in July 2012 Watts hosted an event where more than 1,200 people paid $250 each to see Obama. Later that month, Watts hosted 75 guests in his home for a private, $35,800-a-plate Obama fundraiser. Mackowiak cites 'seed money' story We asked Mackowiak the basis of his seems-dirty-for-the-mayor "seven-figure" claim. By email, he noted two articles, starting with a May 18, 2014, news story about Castro’s rise in the Washington Examiner, a right-leaning weekly magazine and website. That story doesn’t say Castro fielded a big fee while serving as mayor. It does say the "seed money for Castro's time in the mayor's office -- he was first elected in 2009 -- was a controversial seven-figure ‘referral fee’ that Castro, a Harvard-educated lawyer, received from a well-connected trial lawyer and Democratic donor in a personal injury lawsuit in which Castro may or may not have played a major role." After a 2006 accident left three people dead, the story says, a survivor chose Castro’s law firm to represent him against the drunk driver of an oilfield services truck involved in the accident--and Castro referred the "case" to Watts and his larger firm. The story says Watts then "won the case, and a big award and Castro was paid a seven-figure ‘referral fee’ for bringing the suit to Watts' firm." The figure hasn’t been disclosed, the story says, while Castro and Watts have said Castro "played an important role in the case." An Oct. 22, 2015 commentary by Gilbert Garcia of the Express-News, also noted by Mackowiak, credits the "reported seven-figure referral fee" with giving Castro lasting financial stability. San Antonio client: Castro 'a good lawyer' Next, we found coverage of the described fee in Express-News news stories indicating that Castro indeed accepted a sizable referral fee from Watts--about two years before Castro won his first term as mayor. The fee came up the first time in a front-page story published March 22, 2009, less than two months before Castro won election. At the time, per the story, Castro opponents questioned the sourcing of a $215,000 personal loan Castro had made to his campaign the summer before. According to that news report, around Christmas 2006, members of a Mexico-bound San Antonio family died in a wreck involving a drunken-driving suspect. The father of the family, Enrique Mayoral, survived but lost his mother, wife and youngest son, the story said. Mayoral told the newspaper that after the accident, he was besieged by lawyers trying to pick up his case -- some knocking on his door and offering cash -- but he liked the idea of hiring Castro, who seemed trustworthy and connected. Mayoral said he knew Castro through connections in the Edgewood neighborhood where Castro grew up, and when a close family friend suggested that Castro could help him, he took that advice. Mayoral went on to say Castro led an active role in the case, attending attorney-client meetings and taking him to appointments because Mayoral, who had suffered a stroke two years earlier, was unable to drive. "He was a good lawyer and he knew the people who could help me in this case," Mayoral said. "He was always with me, right there. If I had a question, he got the answer. I was glad he was on my side." The legal battle was expected to be costly since the drunken-driver suspect had been in a vehicle owned by an oilfield services company so, according to the story, Castro said he did what many small legal practices do by referring the case to a bigger firm and turning to Watts. Castro told the paper he continued to help Mayoral's cause by working on his original court petition and doing background research, also joining mediation and settlement negotiations. The story said the fee was paid after the suit was settled in June 2007. Undisclosed fee amount The dollar amount of the fee isn’t stated in any of seven stories we found and wasn’t disclosed, several stories say, due to a confidentiality agreement. A judge, the March 2009 story said, sealed related records. Otherwise, then-mayoral hopeful Trish DeBerry-Mejia was quoted in the March 2009 article saying: "Mr. Castro professes to be a man of the people, but how many people have seven-figure referral fees dropped in their laps?" Later, according to an April 2009 Express-News story, DeBerry-Mejia (who didn’t respond to our inquiry) said the fee was $1 million. Our search for other relevant accounts didn’t turn up anything and when we reached Watts, he said by phone he couldn’t confirm the amount due to the confidentiality agreement. We also didn’t draw fresh comment from Castro. By email, a HUD spokesman, Jaime Castillo, told us only that the reported fee didn’t relate to HUD business. We reached out to Mackowiak to share that the fee he associated with Castro’s time as mayor was evidently earned and paid years before. Mackowiak suggested the fee still proved vital for Castro to resume his political career, also saying: "If I got the year wrong, then I admit the error. If you think he ‘worked’ for that enormous referral fee, then you must also believe in the tooth fairy." Our ruling Mackowiak wrote that as mayor, Castro received a seven-figure referral fee that smells like a dirty gift from Obama donor and personal-injury lawyer Mikal Watts. We find that Watts once paid a hefty referral fee to Castro’s law firm--the amount undisclosed. Mackowiak’s declaration that Castro shadily landed the fee while he was mayor, though, doesn’t stand up. All told, we see an element of truth about the legal referral, but Mackowiak was critically wrong about timing — a distinction that puts his statement in a different light. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03828	"In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/frank-keating/does-catholic-church-provide-half-social-services-/	Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press just days after the selection of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina to be the new pope. In praising Pope Francis’ "life of humility," Keating said that judging by his selection, the church was poised to focus on caring for the poor and vulnerable. In his remarks, Keating offered a statistic to demonstrate the depth of the church’s commitment to charity. "In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church," said Keating, who now serves as president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. Keating did not return an inquiry for this story, nor did Catholic Charities USA, the largest charitable organization run by the Catholic church. We asked a variety of experts on philanthropy whether they had heard this statistic or knew where it came from, but none did. We should start by noting that Catholic charity work is extensive and widely considered a crucial part of the nation’s social safety net. By itself, Catholic Charities USA, has more than 2,500 local agencies that serve 10 million people annually, said Mary L. Gautier, a senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, an institute at Georgetown University that studies the church. And Catholic Charities is supplemented by a panoply of other Catholic-affiliated groups, Gautier said, including "St. Vincent De Paul societies, social justice committees, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other similar programs organized independently by thousands of Catholic parishes each year." For a variety of reasons, it’s difficult to quantify exactly how big Catholic-backed charity is, but we tried our best to sift the data with the help of the National Center for Charitable Statistics, a project of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. The first question we asked is whether the sum of all Catholic-sponsored charity amounts to half of all charitable activity by private groups in the United States. We started with the biggest, Catholic Charities USA, then worked outward. In 2010, Catholic Charities USA reported expenditures of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which publishes an annual list of the 400 biggest charities in the United States, ranked by the amount of donations they receive. This enabled it to rank near the top of the 400 list, behind two major social-services charities -- the United Way and the Salvation Army, neither of which is affiliated with the Catholic church. Meanwhile, Catholic News Service has noted a few other Catholic organizations that made the Chronicle’s annual 400 list, including Father Flanagan Boys Home and Covenant House. This excludes Catholic universities, which mainly provide higher education; hospitals, which are categorized separately from social services; and groups that focus on overseas work. Let’s assume that other Catholic groups that didn’t crack the top 400 list spent six times what Catholic Charities USA spent, a multiplier that experts we contacted thought was reasonable. That would make the figure about $26 billion. Then if you suppose that the 18,000 Catholic parishes spent an average of $200,000 on the needy every year beyond what they contribute to any of these charitable organizations, a number also considered plausible by our experts, that would add another $3.6 billion to the total. All told, this would equal about $30 billion. So how does that slice compare to the entire pie? National Center for Charitable Statistics researchers tallied up expenditures by nonprofits in the broad category of "human services," which includes nutrition, employment assistance, legal aid, housing, disaster relief and youth development. In 2010, the most recent year available, they came up with total expenditures of $168 billion in that category. So by our estimate, Catholic-affiliated charity amounts to 17 percent of the funds spent by nonprofits on social services -- well short of the 50 percent Keating cited. Even doubling this share to create a generous margin of error brings it to 34 percent -- still well short of half. But even this may overestimate the footprint of Catholic-supported charities, since it doesn’t include social-service expenditures by the government. In his comment, Keating didn’t specify that he was only talking about social services funded by private groups. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on means-tested programs and tax credits totaled $588 billion in 2012, more than triple what the private sector spent. If you factor in federal spending on these programs, the Catholic share shrinks further, to somewhere in the mid-single digits, depending on how generous your estimate is. Indeed, the government even foots a notable share of the bill for Catholic charitable work through social service contracts. According to NETWORK, a Catholic social-justice lobbying group, the federal government sent more than $1.5 billion to Catholic organizations over a recent two-year period. In 2012, the Economist reported that 62 percent of Catholic Charities’ support came from local, state and federal government agencies. And indirectly, the government maintains a tax exemption for churches and charities, which enables all religious groups to devote more of their funds to charitable work. Taxpayers who itemize can also deduct their donations to charities, including Catholic ones. Our ruling Keating said, "In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church." He’s right that Catholic groups are among the biggest providers of social-service charity in the nation, but it doesn’t appear that they account for half of all such charity. We’re admittedly using a bit of guesswork, but Catholic charity seems to account for 17 percent to 34 percent of all nonprofit social-service charity, depending on how generous an estimate you make. And that share drops to single digits once you factor in the money the federal government spends on means-tested programs. We rate the statement False.

pomt-09648	"I'm predicting (the Saints) will go not only undefeated, but all the way through the Super Bowl -- something that's never been done before."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/08/bobby-jindal/gov-jindal-predicts-saints-will-be-first-go-undefe/	After the New Orleans Saints squeaked by with an overtime win over the hapless Washington Redskins on Dec. 6, 2009, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was apparently feeling pretty confident about his undefeated Saints. "I'm predicting we'll go, not only undefeated, but all the way through the Super Bowl -- something that's never been done before," Jindal said in an interview with radio station WWL in New Orleans the day after the game. "I think the Saints are going to set a national record right here." Clearly, Jindal, who has been talked about as a presidential contender, has not seen the annual -- some would say obnoxious -- champagne celebration by some members of the 1972 Dolphins after the last undefeated NFL team falls. Led by coach Don Shula and quarterback Bob Griese, that Dolphins team laid claim to the first and only "perfect season," going 14-0 in the regular season and then going on to win the Super Bowl. "With all due respect to Governor Jindal, our fans in Louisiana and elsewhere will be disappointed to learn that he forgot about the most accomplished team in NFL history -– the 1972 'Perfect Season' Miami Dolphins," Harvey Greene, the team’s senior vice president of media relations, wrote in an e-mail to Politico , which detailed Jindal's misstep. "We wish the Saints, and the Indianapolis Colts, who are also undefeated, the best of luck in their attempt to match our undefeated season, and we will be the first to congratulate either team if they accomplish that feat. But until then, we remain the only perfect team in NFL history, an achievement our players and coaches rightly are proud of." That's the kind of measured response we might have expected from the Dolphins' front office. But with the Saints still only 12-0 (they'd need to win four more regular season games and three playoff games to finish perfect), we think this smack talk from former Dolphins running back Mercury Morris, uttered when the New England Patriots made a run at a perfect season in 2007, is perhaps more appropriate: "Like I said, don't call me when you're in my town, call me when you're on my block and I see you next door moving your furniture in." We're all for hometown boostering, especially from a guy like Gov. Jindal who said he suffered through the Saints' many bad years too, but we're all about the facts here, and he fumbled this one.

pomt-13204	"We’re already bombing seven countries."	true	/texas/statements/2016/oct/21/jill-stein/jill-stein-green-party-candidate-correct-about-us-/	Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential nominee, charged the major-party hopefuls with failing to tell Americans how they’d tackle challenges including foreign conflicts. Stein, speaking at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump a couple of nights before the last 2016 presidential debate: "They are very busy talking about grabbing women’s genitalia so that they don’t have to reveal that they cannot tell you what are we going to do about this crashing economy, what are we going to do about the climate that is barreling down on us, this catastrophe of the climate." Stein drew our curiosity when she went on: "They don’t have a solution to the expanding wars except more wars. We are already bombing seven countries and now we do appear to be engaging in this war crime in Yemen where we have been partnering with the Saudis in this war crime for the past year. They do not want to talk about that." Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has sided with Yemen’s government against Houthi rebels in a continuing war. For this fact check, we wondered if the U.S. is bombing seven countries. That at least has been so: In September 2014, PunditFact rated True a bombed-countries claim by Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker. Lizza referred to President George W. Bush and his successor, Barack Obama, in a tweet that said: "Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4." At the time, the U.S. on Obama’s watch had bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. When we asked Stein for her backup information, spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa pointed out various web posts including a September 2014 CNN news story stating that Obama had ordered air strikes in seven countries through the bulk of his eight years in the office. Mindful that Stein spoke in the present tense, we checked on if the U.S. has lately been bombing seven countries. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries. The bureau annotates each incident with links to press reports. When we looked, the bureau’s accounts by country indicated the latest U.S drone strike in Pakistan occurred in May 2016; the latest strike in Somalia was in September 2016; and the latest U.S. strikes in Yemen and Afghanistan were in October 2016. Separately, we noticed, the Department of Defense said in an Oct. 11, 2016, web post that countries including the U.S. battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, have conducted 15,634 air strikes to date -- 10,129 in Iraq, 5,505 in Syria -- with the U.S. conducting 6,868 in Iraq and 5,227 in Syria. In a Sept. 30, 2016, post, the U.S. Air Force said attacks from the air have affected ISIL’s "ability to fight and conduct operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan." Too, in August 2016, the New York Times reported the U.S. had "stepped up a new bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Libya, conducting its first armed drone flights from Jordan to strike militant targets" in Libya’s coastal city of Sirte. That news story quoted Obama saying during a news conference that the airstrikes were critical to helping Libya’s fragile United Nations-backed government to drive Islamic State militants out of Sirte, which the group has controlled since June 2015. Obama promised the air campaign would continue as long as necessary to make sure that the extremist group "does not get a stronghold in Libya," the newspaper said. Our ruling Stein said: "We’re already bombing seven countries." We identified seven countries lately bombed by the U.S.: Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Libya.

pomt-01506	Says opponent Mary Burke says she "supports Obamacare unequivocally and wants to expand it."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/23/scott-walker/mary-burke-supports-obamacare-unequivocally-and-wa/	Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign released one of those ominous-mood TV ads on Sept. 18, 2014. The ad opens with flames on the screen and a siren wailing in the background as a narrator with a deep voice intones: "It’s been called the Lie of the Year." The reference is to PolitiFact National’s 2013 Lie of the Year, which was President Barack Obama saying about his Affordable Care Act: "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it." Moments later, the narrator states: "But while millions have lost their doctors and their plans, Mary Burke says she still supports Obamacare unequivocally and wants to expand it." We’ll check Walker’s claim about Burke -- that she says she backs the law "unequivocally" and that she wants to expand it. Obamacare, Medicaid, rollout The Affordable Care Act, of course, is Obama’s signature piece of legislation. Among its many provisions, the health care reform law mandates that people have health insurance, through an employer, a government program or by buying it with a government subsidy through an online marketplace that was created as part of the law. The law also provides for the expansion of Medicaid, the federal- and state-run health care program for the poor, by making millions more low-income people eligible for it. Walker, however, refused the expansion for Wisconsin, saying he didn’t trust the federal government to keep its promise to pick up the vast majority of the cost. Obamacare has been law since March 2010, but its provisions took effect in stages. One milestone occurred on Oct. 1, 2013 when the online marketplaces were opened. That rollout was badly marred by technical problems. Walker’s evidence To back the claim about Burke and Obamacare, Walker’s campaign cited an April 2014 MSNBC.com article about Burke’s candidacy for governor. It contained just one sentence about Obamacare: "Burke is an unequivocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act and wants to expand Medicaid in the state, which Walker has refused to do." There was no attribution for the statement, nor quote to that effect from Burke. So, the Walker campaign is picking up the reporter’s characterization, not Burke’s own words. Also in April 2014, Burke was asked by the Green Bay Press-Gazette if she supports Obamacare. She said, as she has on many occasions, that unlike Walker she backs the Medicaid expansion part of the law. "Well, what I support is I would have taken the federal Medicaid money that Governor Walker turned down," she said. "This is hundreds of millions of dollars a year that not only makes health care more affordable in Wisconsin, but it helps fuel our economy." It’s worth noting that after she elaborated on what she views as the advantages of taking the additional federal money, Burke referred to problems with the online marketplace rollout. "Certainly, Obamacare has its problems. I mean that was a really rough rollout," Burke said. "And I think time will tell how many people sign up. Certainly the latest numbers look quite encouraging. But we have to make sure that it is a system that’s working. And it needs to be changed if it’s not working." The Walker ad includes some video clips previously posted by the Wisconsin GOP of Burke, prior to her candidacy, defending Obamacare. But for the most part during the campaign, Republicans have tried to call out Burke for not being more clear on her position on Obamacare or for backtracking on her support of it. Indeed, while Burke has been clear on her contrast with Walker on the Medicaid expansion, she generally has avoided making comments about the overall law, although she has indicated support. We asked Burke’s campaign for Burke’s position on Obamacare. A spokeswoman replied by referring us to comments Burke made in the Green Bay newspaper interview. We also looked at some of Burke’s other statements. Asked in a Milwaukee TV interview in December 2013 if she supports the law in principle, Burke essentially sidestepped the question. But she said Wisconsin should have created its own online marketplace, or exchange, rather than having Wisconsin residents use the federal one, which is what Walker opted to do. "I look at how Minnesota has handled it, and Minnesota actually has been able to do it in a way that benefits the people of Minnesota. And we had the same opportunity here in Wisconsin, but first and foremost we needed to accept the federal Medicaid money," she said. Similarly, Burke told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in August 2014: "With our own online insurance marketplace, we could have negotiated with insurers to hold down prices. Obamacare has problems that need to be fixed, but we have to hold down healthcare costs to become a thriving, top 10 economy." Our rating Walker said Burke says she "supports Obamacare unequivocally and wants to expand it." Walker provided no evidence that Burke has expressed unequivocal support for the Affordable Care Act, and we are not aware of any. At the same time, Burke does back the law and she supports expanding it through making more people eligible for Medicaid. Walker’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's web page.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-09-23T16:42:17	2014-09-18	['None']
pomt-06210	The United States "is number one in the world in energy resources; Russia is number two."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/dec/08/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-leads-world-fossil-fuel-resou/	Republican George Allen says the United States has plenty of fossil fuel resources and that the president should allow more exploration and excavation of them. "We are blessed to be number one in the world in energy resources; Russia is number two," Allen, a Republican, said during a Dec. 7 debate with Democrat Tim Kaine. The two former governors are running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Jim Webb, D-Va., who will not seek reelection next year. When it comes to coal, oil and natural gas, are we really No. 1 here in the United States? Allen bases his statement on reports by the Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan research arm of the legislative branch. The CRS study, and our own research, relied on the Energy Information Administration. The EIA, a unit of the Department of Energy, is a clearinghouse for information on energy production and consumption. The CRS converts the different types of fossil fuels into a "barrels of oil equivalent." Since each fuel produces a different amount of energy when burned, the conversion allows an "apples-to-apples" comparison. Natural gas reserves, for example, are reported per trillion cubic feet. About 5.64 trillion cubic feet of natural gas produce the same amount of energy as one billion barrels of oil. Coal reserves are reported in tons. One billion tons of coal produces as much energy as 3.45 billion barrels of oil. According to this year’s CRS report, the United States has the highest amount of proven fossil fuel reserves, the equivalent of 973.1 billion barrels of oil. Russia is second at the equivalent of 954.9 billion barrels of oil, followed by China with 474.8 billion barrels. Iran and Saudi Arabia are fourth and fifth, at 328.1 billion barrels and 309.1 billion barrels, respectively. The CRS also attempts to project the quantity of undiscovered reserves in each nation. When those are included, the U.S. and Russia retain the first two spots and Saudi Arabia moves into third place because of its vast oil endowment. Uncle Sam is the undisputed king of coal, holding more than 27 percent of the world’s reserves. The U.S. ranks fourth in natural gas reserves, behind Russia, Iran and Qatar. We are a distant 11th when it comes to oil reserves, behind several Middle Eastern countries, Canada, Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria. When it comes to newer technologies like biofuels or wind power, there is little uniform data on their global potential. Before we issue a ruling, there are a few caveats worth considering. A key issue is that world reserves of fossil fuels are always evolving. New fields are discovered, estimates for existing fields are altered, and resources are extracted or burned. Essentially, experts who estimate reserves are aiming at a moving target. And as former Energy Department official Alan Hegberg pointed out to us earlier this year, some reserves may stay untapped in the current economic climate, given the cost or difficulty of extraction. But advances in technology or changes in weather could change the equation in the future. One example, he said, is the Arctic Ocean. "People think there is a ton of gas in the Arctic," he said. Arctic natural gas is now considered inaccessible, but a receding ice pack and longer summers could make those resources easier to reach. The next issue will be who owns the gas under the ice pack. Russia has tried to stake some claims, but Canada, the United States and Denmark -- which controls Greenland -- will also want a say. Our conclusion: Allen said the U.S. has the most plentiful energy resources in the world, followed by Russia. According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. has the largest proven reserve of fossil fuel resources and Russia is No. 2. Data from the Energy Information Agency show that Russia has the largest volume of the three fossil fuels. But the American lead in coal, which produces very high amounts of energy when burned, means the United States narrowly edges Russia in the CRS report. We rate the statement True.

pomt-13604	Says there were multiple instances of voter fraud in Wood County, Ohio.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2016/aug/16/viral-image/viral-post-alleges-voter-fraud-wood-county-ohio/	A viral image is making new rounds on the Internet, asking, "Ever wonder why Republicans want Voter ID?" Similar claims popped up after the 2012 election between President Barack Obama and the former governor of Massachusetts, Republican Mitt Romney. Our national and Florida fact-checkers have debunked several examples within this viral image already (check here and here). We wondered if claims about Ohio counties were any more accurate. In northwest Ohio, Wood County is home to Bowling Green, the city and university of the same name. The first statement reads, "In 21 districts in Wood County, Ohio, Obama received 100 percent of the votes where GOP inspectors were illegally removed from their polling locations — and not one single vote was recorded for Romney. (A statistical impossibility.)" The second statement says that "106,258 people in Wood County are registered to vote out of an eligible 98,213." The third says, "In one Ohio county, Obama won by 108 percent of the total number of eligible voters." Is something rotten in Wood? These claims unravel quickly with a check of 2012 poll results. 100 percent of the vote? We’ll start with the claim about Obama getting 100 percent of the votes in 21 Wood County "districts." First off, in Ohio they’re called precincts, not districts. A precinct-by-precinct check shows that neither presidential candidate received 100 percent of the votes in any of the county’s 97 precincts. (Therefore, Romney also earned votes, contrary to the claim.) Other fact-checkers also cast doubt on these allegations. As fellow fact-checkers at Snopes rightly noted, "The highest percentage (Obama) achieved in any one precinct was 75.5 percent." FactCheck.org asked Terry Burton, director of the elections board in Wood County, about GOP inspectors being removed. "No precinct officials were removed during Election Day and no issues were identified during a recount," he answered. Ghost registrations Now for the post’s second statement about over-registrations. The 98,213 number comes from the 2010 census total of people 18 and over in Wood County. According to the election board’s data from 2012, there were 108,014 registered voters in the county at that time — an even bigger gap between people and voters than what the meme claimed. But that doesn’t mean there is foul play. PolitiFact Ohio found that the discrepancy is owed to the large population of college kids at Bowling Green. Students register to vote there and later graduate and move away, abandoning their voter registrations along with their raggedy couches. Elections officials are allowed to purge the rolls of inactive voters after they miss three successive federal elections — a practice that Ohio’s Secretary of State Jon Husted has defended as Election Day 2016 approaches. 108 percent Now let’s consider the post’s vague reference to "one Ohio county" where Obama allegedly got 108 percent of the vote. The numbers for Wood County, where the meme suggests that fraud is so rampant, lead us to believe that this is still about Wood. The number of registered voters, 106,258, is about 108 percent of 98,213, the size of the vote-eligible population in 2012. But election results show that in real life, Obama received 51 percent of the vote in Wood County. We asked Carol DeJong, deputy director of the Wood County Board of Elections, why conspiracy theorists are obsessed with her county. "As a reporter, you would be better at solving that mystery," she replied via email. Our ruling A viral post makes several claims about 2012 voter fraud in Ohio, ginning up fears ahead of the 2016 presidential election. But the election tallies discredit the claims about voter fraud in Ohio. Election board officials cannot corroborate the claim of GOP monitors being "illegally removed" from polling places. The numbers 106,258 (registered voters) and 98,213 (residents old enough to vote) include the ghost registrations of inactive voters that lingered on the rolls. Finally, Obama got 51 percent of the vote in Wood County, not 108 percent. This viral image is 108 percent wrong.

pomt-01432	More women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends since Sept. 11 than "all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/07/gloria-steinem/steinem-more-women-killed-partners-911-deaths-atta/	When pundits really want the scope of a big issue to hit home, they sometimes relate it to events that are universally affecting, like Sept. 11 or deaths of soldiers from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Feminist activist Gloria Steinem used both to illustrate the prevalence of domestic violence amid recent high-profile NFL scandals. "When we think of violence against women, for instance, we understandably think mainly of other countries, where the degree of violence is much higher," Steinem is quoted as saying in an Oct. 1, 2014, Associated Press story. "But what is also true is that if you added up all the women who have been murdered by their husbands or boyfriends since 9/11, and then you add up all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq, more women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends." A reader wanted to know if her factoid is accurate. It is. Females killed by intimate partners The Justice Department offers a breakdown of homicides with female victims, more than one-third of which involve "intimate partners," which could be current or former (or male or female). From 2002 to 2012, the number of women killed by intimate partners was 15,462, according to data from James A. Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who adjusted federal data for unsolved homicide cases believed to be linked to intimate partners. Another tally, this one from a 2013 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report, shows 10,470 women killed in intimate partner homicides from 2002 to 2010. (That tally should be higher, too, because it does not account for the 3.5 months that followed Sept. 11, 2001.) In summary, it’s possible that some female victims were killed by female "intimate partners," but we don't know for sure because the data isn't broken down that way. But because the available data also excludes recent years, the true number is likely higher overall. Deaths from 9/11 and the wars Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on Sept. 11, including the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York, the plane crash at the Pentagon and the fourth crash in a small field in rural Shanksville, Pa., according to a 10-year memorandum on the Sept. 11 attacks from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. Specifically, the consortium counts 2,997 deaths, which shrinks if you deduct the 19 jihadists. Also, a few people have died in recent years due to complications from injuries and conditions related to 9/11. Bottom line: The figure is less than 3,000 if you count only "Americans" as Steinem said. (People from 90 different countries died in the attacks, according to the U.S. State Department.) As for the wars, the U.S. Department of Defense releases a daily count of casualties involving military and government personnel from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The American death count for Operation Iraqi Freedom, which began in March 2003 and was renamed Operation New Dawn in 2010, is 4,491 deaths. There have been 2,210 total American deaths in Afghanistan stemming from Operation Enduring Freedom, which started with airstrikes in Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001. Another 134 Americans have died in places outside of Afghanistan in work related to the operation, and three civilian Defense Department employees were also killed in this effort. That brings the total to 2,347. So the total deaths from Sept. 11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is a maximum of 9,838. It’s lower when we exclude non-American victims on Sept. 11. Our ruling Steinem said that more women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends since Sept. 11 than "all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq." You can argue about the significance of such a comparison, but on the numbers, Steinem is accurate. Since Sept. 11, 2001, more women have been killed by "intimate partners" -- the federal jargon for current or former spouses -- than all of the victims in Sept. 11 and the American victims in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that ensued.

pomt-05483	"Congress as a whole is less popular than it’s been since polling was invented."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/apr/19/jim-cooper/democratic-congressman-jim-cooper-says-congress-ap/	With the economy still in recovery, an election on the horizon and Congress stuck in what seems like a perpetual state of gridlock, suffice it to say that voters are fed up with politicians and how the federal government is being run. U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Nashville, reflected on Congress’ unpopularity in a recent op-ed article and compared the legislative branch to a sick patient in dire need of strong medicine. "Congress as a whole is less popular than it’s been since polling was invented," Cooper wrote in The Hill, a newspaper that closely chronicles what’s happening in Congress. We knew these have not been the best of times to be a federal officeholder. But we wondered if Cooper is right that Congress is more unpopular than ever before, so we called his office and asked for his sources. His spokeswoman, Katie Hill, said in an email message that the information came from media reports about Gallup polling on congressional job approval. She provided us with links to the Gallup poll and to related articles in The Washington Post and The Hill. Since Cooper argued that Congress is the most unpopular it has been since polling was invented, a bit of history is in order. Gallup founder George Gallup is often credited with developing the first scientific methods of measuring public opinion. Gallup was not the first person to do political polling. According to PBS, newspapers often augmented their election coverage by interviewing voters as they left the polling places. These impromptu interviews were called "straw polls," and the first one recorded in the United States took place in 1824. By the turn of the century, they were common in both local and national newspapers and magazines. Gallup was among the first practitioners of scientific polling. The Gallup Organization and its predecessor, the American Institute of Public Opinion, have been asking Americans for their thoughts on political and economic matters since 1935. It wasn’t until 1974, however, that Gallup began asking Americans if they approve of the job Congress is doing. The Gallup poll that Cooper was referencing was conducted Feb. 2-5, 2012, about two weeks after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address and the reconvening of the House and the Senate. The poll found that just 10 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, the legislative body’s lowest rating ever. The previous all-time low was recorded in December 2011, when just 11 percent of Americans approved of the way Congress was handling its job. Other polls have shown similar results. A CBS News/New York Times poll conducted just a few days after the Gallup survey -- on Feb. 8-13, 2012 -- put Congress’ approval rating at 10 percent, a near-record low. The all-time low was recorded just a few months earlier, when Congress received a 9 percent approval rating in October 2011. That was the lowest rating recorded since the poll first asked the question in 1977. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Jan. 12-15, 2012, found that just 13 percent of Americans approve of the way Congress is handling its job. The pollsters said it was Congress’ worst rating ever in the survey. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted on Jan. 22-24 also put Congress approval rating at 13 percent, just one point higher than the all-time low in that poll. The all-time low was 12 percent and was recorded back in 2008. Our ruling At least four recent polls put Congress’ approval rating at record or near-record lows. Even in those cases where the most recent approval rating is not the lowest on record, the difference between the most recent and the lowest ratings is just 1 percentage point. Thus, Cooper’s statement turns the dial to True on the Truth-o-Meter.	None	Jim Cooper	None	None	None	2012-04-19T08:28:19	2012-03-20	['None']

pomt-03046	Says David Dewhurst "went out for drinks" during Senate debate on abortion bill.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/07/todd-staples/dewhurst-visited-restaurant-during-debate-unclear-/	Republican challengers to Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst have been making a meal out of an incident during Texas Senate debate on tightening abortion clinic regulations. One example: In an interview Aug. 29, 2013, on Lubbock’s KFYO-AM, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples said, "The current incumbent lieutenant governor went out for drinks during the legislative session when that bill was originally on the Senate floor." Staples made clear in the interview that that he wasn’t referring to the night Sen. Wendy Davis filibustered abortion restrictions, June 25-26, 2013, but to earlier debate over the same measure, Senate Bill 5, in the first summer special session called by Gov. Rick Perry. Under Democratic fire, the proposal perished in that session, but it passed into law in a second session called by Perry. Not all versions of the claim about Dewhurst’s whereabouts have been so clear. On a website launched Aug. 16, 2013, by Sen. Dan Patrick, like Staples a Republican challenging Dewhurst for the lieutenant governorship, comic cat videos illustrate "the night that will live in Texas political infamy" -- Davis’ filibuster -- with captions claiming Dewhurst "was out having a glass of wine with a political consultant friend" on "the night of the important pro-life bill debate." Another Republican challenger, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, alluded to failed leadership and "vanities like expensive steak dinners with overpriced consultants," according to a July 12, 2013, news blog entry by the Dallas Morning News. Staples raised the issue again at a Sept. 16, 2013, debate, according to a Houston Chronicle news story posted that day, which quoted him as saying, "You don't go out to eat and drink with lobbyists when there are issues on the floor of the Senate that you are supposed to be dealing with." It’s not uncommon for legislators to step out and grab dinner when work runs late, nor for the lieutenant governor to hand off the duty of presiding over the proceedings to a senator. So, what exactly happened? As the Senate debated amendments late on June 18, 2013, before voting to send the abortion proposal to the House, Dewhurst chaired most of the evening session and also watched over the final vote. In between, he stepped out for a time -- newspapers reported that tweets placed him at a steakhouse eight blocks from the Capitol -- and he confirmed to reporters when he returned that he’d been at Austin Land and Cattle. "No steak," though, he said, and did not answer a question about whether he’d had any wine. Reporters and lege-watchers registered surprise that Dewhurst would depart during debate on an issue he had urged Perry to add to the agenda. Staples campaign spokesman Kent Sholars emailed us the Morning News blog post and a June 24, 2013, San Antonio Express News/Houston Chronicle news story. We looked at those and other news accounts, tweets, Senate journals (which document floor proceedings) and video of the relevant debate. We asked Dewhurst’s campaign staff for comment, but did not hear back. What we did find confirmed Staples’ statement except for the claim that Dewhurst had "drinks"; reports were mixed on that score. Sholars noted that the Morning News blog post said Dewhurst had decided "to slip out for a glass of wine." The blog entry didn’t cite a source for that statement. One of the reports said that at the restaurant, Dewhurst met up with political consultant Rob Johnson. We tried to contact Johnson but did not hear back. He was Dewhurst’s chief of staff from 2006 to mid-2009, when he became manager of Perry’s re-election campaign, then managed presidential campaigns for Newt Gingrich and Perry before starting a political action committee to boost Dewhurst’s U.S. Senate bid in 2012. The Morning News also reported, "Dewhurst didn’t eat. As his spokesman Travis Considine noted two days later, he presided over most of the debate and was confident colleagues could soldier on during his brief absence." Senate journals for June 18, 2013, show Dewhurst had earlier presided over the floor proceedings from 12:20 p.m. to 1:39 p.m., then gaveled the Senate back in at 5:39 p.m. to take up the abortion-restriction measure. Dewhurst called for a break at 8:54 p.m., according to the journal, and Sen. Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, took over the duties of presiding from Dewhurst as debate resumed at 9:15 p.m. The Senate adjourned at 10:15 p.m. and was called to order again by Dewhurst at 11:09 p.m. After voting to approve the measure, the Senate called it a night at 11:45 p.m. Among tweets collected in a Statesman politics blog post June 19, 2013, Associated Press Capitol reporter Jim Vertuno wrote, "Since everyone (is) wondering, Dewhurst is back in the chamber. He was here for 3 hours of debate, let Eltife chair most amendments." Also during the debate, Express-News reporter Peggy Fikac tweeted, "Re Land & Cattle, @DavidHDewhurst confirms he was there to say hi to a consultant but ‘no steak.’ " Our ruling Staples said, "The current incumbent lieutenant governor went out for drinks during the legislative session when that bill was originally on the Senate floor." Dewhurst has said that he stepped out to a restaurant during part of a lengthy Senate debate on abortion legislation June 18. But Staples did not prove he had drinks, and we found no such confirmation either. Given that going "out for drinks" has connotations that just aren't supported by the available evidence, we rate Staples’ statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-11252	Says that on the tax reform law, Democratic leaders "are promising to take it all away."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/02/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-democratic-leaders-are-threatening-/	On "tax day," U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan trumpeted what he said are some of the benefits -- in addition to lower taxes -- of the GOP tax reform signed into law in December 2017: Pay raises and bonuses for workers, and companies creating more jobs and bringing home money from overseas. Then the Wisconsin Republican, speaking at an April 17, 2018 news conference, made an attack, saying: Yet, Democratic leaders are still out there spreading doom and gloom. They call it crumbs. They talk about a dark cloud. And they are promising to take it all away. Are they? Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Pelosi comments 1. To back Ryan’s statement, his campaign staff cited an April 2018 website posting about Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House. It carried this headline: "Pelosi: Democrats Will Repeal the GOP Tax Law When We Retake the House." But in the video clip that accompanies the article, Pelosi wasn’t that explicit. Pelosi had been asked at a town hall meeting if Democrats win control of the House in the November 2018 elections, "will you rewrite the tax bill from scratch, or focus on reversing specific components?" She replied: We’ll sit down at the table and say, What would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good-paying jobs, as it reduces the deficit?...We can do that, we must do that, in a bipartisan way. It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future. So, Pelosi said she would be willing to work with Republicans on overhauling, or overturning the law, in an unspecified way. 2. Two months earlier, Pelosi did use the word repeal in speaking about Democrats retaking control of the House. But she appeared to be joking, and also spoke of a bipartisan effort. She was asked at a news conference: "You spoke earlier this week about how, if Democrats take back Congress, that you would want to work on a fair tax system. Tell us a little bit more about what you mean. Is that basically like a repeal and replace of the new tax law?" Pelosi replied: Well, it may have to be a replace and repeal (chuckles). Replace them (Republicans) and repeal the bill. No, (Rep. Joe Crowley) and Congresswoman Sanchez, they’re on the Ways and Means Committee and I’m going to defer to them on this. But we’ve always said, you can’t do this tax bill without having it being bipartisan. We want to recognize that perhaps we should lower the corporate rate; maybe that’s so, maybe not, what’s the case for it. But if you’re going to have sustainability in a tax reform, it has to be bipartisan. More fact checks on tax reform: Did Nancy Pelosi vow to raise taxes if Democrats take the U.S. House? Half True. Does the newly signed Republican tax reform law mean $1,000 or more per year for Americans? Half True. 3. Pelosi’s office, responding to Ryan’s claim, cited a Pelosi statement from a March 2018 news conference as being representative of what she has said on the subject. After repeatedly calling the GOP reform a "tax scam" for helping the rich more than the middle class, she said: We would have bipartisan, open hearings on how we go forward. What’s the appropriate level of a corporate tax cut? How do we first and foremost empower financially the middle class and make that permanent, not treat them as second class people in our country? Because we said for corporations it’s a permanent tax cut, for people it’s not permanent. And, again, it would be unifying. Unifying. It would be bipartisan, open, transparent, and unifying as we go forward to strengthen middle class tax cuts and to do so in a way that creates good paying jobs, promotes growth and reduces the deficit. So, Pelosi has talked about a comprehensive review of taxes and alluded to repealing the GOP tax reform law. But she has also talked about a corporate tax rate lower than what it was before the reform, and about maintaining tax breaks for the middle class. Schumer comments We also reviewed the statements of the Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York. 1. At a March 2018 news conference about Democrats’ proposals for infrastructure projects, Schumer spoke about reversing only certain GOP tax reforms, saying: Rather than cutting existing infrastructure projects to pay for a paltry program, we want to roll back the Republican tax giveaways to big corporations and the wealthy, and invest that money instead in job-creating infrastructure. 2. Schumer had gone further shortly after the tax bill’s passage, telling reporters, according to The Hill: There are probably a small number of provisions we might not repeal. It certainly would need drastic overhaul aiming it at the middle class, not the wealthy and powerful. 3. But Schumer’s office told us Democrats only want to roll back provisions for the wealthy and some of those for corporations -- but leave intact tax cuts for workers and the middle class. A summary of the Democrats’ infrastructure proposal would, among other things, restore the top individual tax rate and the estate tax to what they were before the GOP tax reform law, and put the corporate tax rate at 25 percent, up from 21 percent under the GOP law. Schumer emphasized the GOP tax cuts for the rich in saying about the Democratic alternative: We want to roll back the Republican tax giveaways to big corporations and the wealthy and invest that money instead in job-creating infrastructure. So, like Pelosi, Schumer has spoken about resetting the corporate tax rate to lower than it had been before the GOP reform law, but higher than where the reform law put it. Schumer’s emphasis has been on reversing tax breaks for the rich, not for scrapping the entire reform law. Another leader Ryan’s office also pointed out "tax day" remarks by U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. He didn’t threaten repeal of the GOP tax reform, but called on Republicans to do so, saying: The Republican caucus needs to announce that it will repeal and replace this bill. This is the bill that needs to be repealed and replaced. They are focused on health care. Repeal this bill, my Republican colleagues. Our rating Ryan says that on the tax reform law, Democratic leaders "are promising to take it all away." Democratic leaders in Congress have been harshly critical of the law, and have talked about the need to repeal or at least review most of it. But the tax reform law also provides tax benefits to the middle class, which the Democratic leaders have indicated they want to keep. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2018-05-02T06:00:00	2018-04-17	['None']
pomt-01155	"It has been many years, if ever, since an inmate has completed his or her high school diploma while incarcerated in a state correctional facility for adults."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/dec/16/lc-buster-evans/politifact-high-school-diplomas-will-be-new-under-/	Gov. Nathan Deal announced in November that the state Department of Corrections will be partnering with a charter school to help inmates at one state prison receive their high school diplomas. Deal said the program should allow inmates at Lee Arrendale State Prison in Habersham County to "change the direction of their lives" and have "a greater chance of avoiding relapse" once they are back in society. Seven out of 10 inmates in Georgia’s state prisons lack a high school diploma or GED, the governor said. "It has been many years, if ever, since an inmate has completed his or her high school diploma while incarcerated in a state correctional facility for adults," L.C. "Buster" Evans, assistant commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, said in a Nov. 12 press release. The statement by Evans, a former Forsyth County school superintendent, piqued our interest. Hadn’t policymakers in Georgia and nationally been talking on and off for years about the high rate of recidivism among released prisoners? And hadn’t most concluded that the solutions are complex but include addressing systemic barriers to success, such as insufficient job skills and education? We began by contacting Susan Megahee, a spokeswoman at the Georgia Department of Corrections, which runs one of the nation’s largest prison systems with nearly 55,000 inmates, more than 160,000 probationers and 12,000 employees. We asked about Evans’ statement. "We have no historical data of any offender receiving a high school diploma," Megahee told PolitiFact. That doesn’t mean that some inmates who have entered the prison system as high school dropouts haven’t become more marketable -- from an educational standpoint -- while behind bars. Indeed, thousands have. But until now, the avenue they had was the GED, a four-subject high school equivalency test that measures skills required by high schools and expected by colleges and employers. The four subjects are science, social studies, mathematical reasoning and reasoning through language arts. GED programs are available to offenders in state prisons, private prisons, transitional centers and the Bainbridge Substance Abuse Treatment Center, Megahee told PolitiFact. Inmates at those facilities earned 1,557 GEDs in fiscal 2009, 1,510 in 2010, 1,620 in 2011, 1,260 in 2012, 1,290 in 2013 and 1,167 in 2014, according to the Technical College System of Georgia, the agency that administers the GED program. The Department of Corrections in the past has assessed offenders’ level of education by three standards -- Literacy Remedial Reading, below the fifth-grade level; Adult Basic Education between the fifth-grade and eighth-grade levels; and General Educational Development (GED), testing at or above the eighth-grade level with the potential to earn a high school equivalency diploma. "Now, that our partnership with (Mountain Education Charter School) has been established, we will offer an additional opportunity for education, which is a true high school diploma," Megahee said. "These options will help prepare returning citizens for successful re-entry." This is possible under a state law that designates the Department of Corrections as a "special school" district, she said. Beginning in January, teachers from the Mountain Education Charter School -- a collaboration between the school districts in Elbert, Fannin, Forsyth, Gilmer, Lumpkin, Pickens, Rabun, Towns, Union and White counties -- are expected to use online and self-paced instructional programming to work with suitable inmates from Arrendale. These teachers already work with nontraditional students, and this program with the Department of Corrections will pair them with some of Arrendale’s 1,400 female inmates -- 200 of whom are under age 22. "This will have a long-term impact on recidivism by graduating more inmates with a high school credential," said Mike Light, a spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia and a former spokesman for the Department of Corrections. He said it reflects positively "on the governor on down" and marks a major shift in philosophy from the days when prisoners were released with $25 and a bus ticket and told "hope you don’t come back." The prison system will still have GED programs, and it announced in August that it is fast-tracking GED programs for inmates at Arrendale and two other medium-security prisons. Inmates at these facilities will be able to prepare for their GEDs in 10 to 12 weeks -- rather than the normal 16 to 18 months -- and then be eligible for further vocational and job training, state officials said. "With over 27,000 offenders that have self-reported as not having a high school diploma, offering this additional programming will allow for more offenders to earn their GED," Department of Corrections Commissioner Brian Owens said in August. "Offender education is a top priority in our departmental efforts toward criminal justice reform." GEDs are recognized nationwide and accepted by more than 95 percent of U.S. employers, colleges and universities, the Technical College System of Georgia website states. Our conclusion: L.C."Buster" Evans, assistant commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, said: "It has been many years, if ever, since an inmate has completed his or her high school diploma while incarcerated in a state correctional facility for adults." He is technically correct that Georgia prisons have not had a high school program such as the one that is being launched in January. And in a prison system where seven out of 10 inmates lack a diploma or GED, this could be the start of major improvements. But the GED is a high school equivalency, recognized by the vast majority of employers, colleges and universities. And that’s something the state has been helping some inmates attain for years. That’s important context. For this reason, we rate Evans’ statement Mostly True.	None	L.C. "Buster" Evans	None	None	None	2014-12-16T00:00:00	2014-11-12	['None']

pomt-01754	"We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/31/sheila-jackson-lee/rep-sheila-jackson-lee-d-texas-says-we-did-not-see/	As Congress’ August recess loomed, partisan skirmishing reached a crescendo, with the U.S. House approving, on a near-party-line vote, a lawsuit against President Barack Obama on the grounds that he had overstepped his constitutional authority. Democrats, noting past statements by some Republicans in Congress, raised the specter of the president being impeached, though Republican House leaders insisted that impeachment wasn’t an option. During the floor debate over authorizing the lawsuit against Obama, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, suggested that Democrats had the moral high ground. Even though some Democrats had thought that President George W. Bush had abused his authority when he initiated the Iraq War, the House, while under Democratic control in 2007 and 2008, did not impeach him. The current resolution to authorize a lawsuit, Jackson Lee said in a floor speech on July 30, 2014, "smacks against the Constitution, which says there are three equal branches of government. Therefore, the executive has the right to perform his duties. I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution for it is, in fact, a veiled attempt for impeachment, and it undermines the law that allows the president to do his job. It is a historical fact that President Bush pushed this nation into a war that had little to do with apprehending terrorists. We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush because as an executive, he had his authority. President Obama has the authority." A reader asked us to check whether it’s accurate for Jackson Lee to say, "We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush." So we took a closer look. Jackson Lee, it turns out, is an imperfect vehicle for making this charge. Here’s the problem: A dozen House Democrats in 2008 did introduce a resolution seeking the impeachment of Bush. And Jackson Lee was one of the measure’s 11 co-sponsors. The measure in question was H. Res. 1258, introduced by then-Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, on June 10, 2008. The resolution -- a 167-page laundry list of criticisms -- accused Bush of "high crimes and misdemeanors," citing numerous "abuses of power" related to his prosecution of the war in Iraq and the fight against global terrorism, among other topics. If Jackson Lee means to define "we" as the Democratic caucus as a whole, she has a point. The resolution never gained wide support among the Democrats, even though they controlled Congress at the time. The bill died quietly in committee. Pelosi explained her thinking about the impeachment resolution in a July 2008 interview on ABC's The View. "I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country," she said. "We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can’t do that if you’re trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes." Even so, it seems odd to hear Jackson Lee saying "we did not seek" impeachment when she, in fact, was a co-sponsor of a measure that sought precisely that. When we reached out to Jackson Lee’s office, communications director Michael J. McQuerry said, "the Congresswoman was stating that the Democrats did not try to impeach President Bush over executive orders." However, we looked through Jackson Lee’s floor speech and saw no references to executive orders. For that matter, the specific target of the House GOP’s lawsuit -- administrative changes to delay the effective date of the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate -- did not take the form of an executive order, either, although Republicans have been critical of some of Obama’s executive orders more generally. Further undercutting Jackson Lee’s explanation, the 2008 impeachment resolution she co-sponsored did address executive orders twice: • It quoted then-Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., saying the Bush administration's "shroud of secrecy extends to agency rules and executive pronouncements, such as executive orders, that carry the force of law. Through the diligent efforts of my colleague, Sen. (Sheldon) Whitehouse (D-R.I), we have learned that (the Office of Legal Counsel) has taken the position that a president can ‘waive’ or ‘modify’ a published executive order without any notice to the public or Congress -- simply by not following it.'" • Citing a 2007 article from the Washington Post, the resolution said that Mike McConnell, Bush’s director of national intelligence, in a letter to the late Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, "acknowledged that Bush's executive order in 2001 authorized a series of secret surveillance activities and included undisclosed activities beyond the warrantless surveillance of emails and phone calls that Bush confirmed in December 2005." Our ruling Jackson Lee said, "We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush." She has a point that neither the House nor a majority of the Democratic caucus sought Bush’s impeachment. However, a dozen Democratic lawmakers did -- including Jackson Lee herself. It seems hypocritical of the congresswoman to seize the moral high ground -- essentially saying that her party gallantly went against self-interest by declining to seek Bush’s impeachment -- when in fact she personally had sought precisely that outcome. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Sheila Jackson Lee	None	None	None	2014-07-31T17:07:34	2014-07-30	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-12988	The 2016 and 2017 Missouri budget includes more funding for the University of Missouri than any time in the last 15 years.	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/dec/18/kurt-schaefer/schaefers-claims-um-system-funding-fall-short/	In a full-page ad published on Nov. 13 in the Columbia Daily Tribune, Republican state Sen. Kurt Schaefer took credit for boosting University of Missouri System funding. In the ad, Schaefer, who represents Boone County, touted his accomplishments as the chair of the Missouri legislature’s Senate Appropriations committee. Schaefer is wrapping up his second four-year term in the Senate. Barred by term limits from serving another term, he ran for attorney general but lost in the primary election to Josh Hawley. "I was able to make sure that the University of Missouri, Boone County, and Columbia received much needed funding on a number of important projects," he wrote. Among his listed achievements was increased funding for the UM System. Schaefer wrote that he helped secure the largest amount of state funding for the four-campus system in the last two years since 2008. Is he correct? We decided to check it out. By the numbers Schaefer cites two amounts for the legislature’s appropriations to the UM System: $434 million for fiscal year 2016 and $448 million for fiscal year 2017. In 2008, the legislature appropriated $431 million to the system’s operating budget. So, technically, funding has increased. But Schaefer did not take into account inflation or rising enrollment over time. In today’s dollars, 2008's appropriations to the UM System total $474 million. That’s a lot more than the legislature allotted for the past two years. Moreover, enrollment has increased. In the fall of 2015, the total enrollment for the UM System was 59,807 full-time students. The fall of 2015 coincides with fiscal year 2016. Enrollment for 2016 dropped slightly: 57,778 students. By comparison, enrollment in 2008 was 51,012 students. That means that in 2008, state-appropriated dollars per student totaled $9,300, after the amounts are adjusted for inflation. In 2015, the amount per student was significantly lower – $7,256 — a 22 percent decrease. A contentious relationship Schaefer was an outspoken critic of the UM System following student protests at MU last year. The protests, which began after students said administrators failed to address racism on campus, culminated in the resignation of then-UM System President Tim Wolfe in November 2015. Schaefer lambasted MU’s handling of Melissa Click, a professor who stoked tension on the day of Wolfe’s resignation when she asked for "some muscle" to remove a student journalist from a protest. In January, Schaefer and more 100 other legislators signed letters urging the UM System Board of Curators to fire Click. The curators voted to fire her in February. He also proposed a legislative commission this year to scrutinize the UM System’s structure, including its diversity programs. Angry about a lack of university leadership during the protests, legislators advocated cutting the UM System’s budget. Schaefer supported that effort, though he took strides to lessen the proposed cuts. The legislature cut appropriations to the system by $3.8 million for fiscal year 2017. Our ruling Schaefer praised his work on the Senate Appropriations Committee, citing increased funding for the UM System as one of his accomplishments. But it’s clear from the data that state funding has not kept pace with rising inflation. In reality, state funding for the UM System has decreased considerably since 2008, despite what Schaefer wrote in his ad. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-02647	"Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country," adding "more than 1,000 people a day."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/16/texans-reliable-power/texas-trails-fastest-growing-state-more-1000-peopl/	In a full-page advertisement in the Austin American-Statesman, Texans for Reliable Power suggested a need for more electricity generation in the state by presenting "facts" starting with: "Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country. As we add more than 1,000 people a day, each new Texan and new business increases demand on our grid." Is Texas (still) growing that fast? In 2010, we rated as Mostly True a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that more than 1,000 people move to Texas every day. With help from the U.S. Census Bureau, we learned that about 635 people were then coming to Texas every day, on average. A census official based that number on average daily net migration from other states (393) plus average daily net migration from other countries (242). IRS data, meanwhile, suggested that about 1,353 a day switched their residence to Texas between the time they filed their tax returns in 2007 and when they filed in 2008. Eric Bearse, a spokesman for the group, which he described as organized by investor-owned power plants, said the ad's reference to Texas having the nation’s fastest population growth reflected raw changes in population, not percentage changes. That’s "because it is the raw number of people that add demand to the (electrical) grid," Bearse said by email before pointing out web links to census population estimates for the states through June 2013 plus a Dec. 21, 2011, census press release indicating Texas was the nation’s fastest-growing state from April 2010 to July 2011. Before Bearse provided the group's back-up information, we had inquired about how fast Texas is growing to the Census Bureau and the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter. Potter drew on the bureau’s state population estimates as of the end of June 2012 and June 2013 to respond by email that Texas gained more than 1,000 residents a day, by those figures, and also gained the most residents of any state. However, Potter and bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, also replying by email, each told us that Texas has not had the fastest growth rate. Specifically, Texas led the nation by gaining 387,397 residents from July 2012 through June 2013. California, ranking second, saw a population bump of 332,643, according to the bureau estimates. Yet North Dakota, whose population increased by 22,000 residents, experienced the greatest percentage growth, 3.1 percent, trailed by Utah (about a 46,000 person increase, 1.6 percent). Next among the states, Colorado and Texas each saw increases of 1.5 percent, according to the estimates. Potter and Bernstein each said that the estimated increase in the population of Texas in 2012-13 means the state gained an average of 1,061 residents a day over the 12 months. Our ruling The group said: "Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country," adding "more than 1,000 people a day." From July 2012 through June 2013, the state’s population increased more than 1,000 people a day, according to government estimates. In raw numbers, Texas also added more new residents than any other state. But the state’s 1.5 percent growth rate trailed the gains of North Dakota and Utah, tying the pace of growth of Colorado. North Dakota also grew faster than Texas from 2010 through June 2013, according to census bureau estimates. Texas ranks among the fastest-growing states; it’s not quite No. 1.

pomt-13293	"I was gone" when there was a red line against Syria.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/hillary-clinton/clinton-and-line-sand-comment/	Hillary Clinton was involved in a decision as secretary of state that "was laughed at all over the world," Donald Trump said at the second debate between the two presidential candidates. Trump, referring to a "line in the sand," brought up President Barack Obama’s so-called "red line" in Syria: That Obama would change his calculus on armed intervention in Syria if dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons. Assad later used chemical weapons, crossing the red line, but Obama did not intervene with force. Clinton "was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand," Trump said, his statement abruptly cut off by Clinton. "No I wasn’t. I was gone," she said. "I hate to interrupt you, but at some point we need to do some fact-checking." Trump replied, "You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps sadly Obama probably still listened to you, I don’t think he’ll be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened." Since there was a call for some fact-checking, we decided to find out who’s correct on the timeline — Clinton or Trump. Basically, Obama drew the chemical weapons "red line" in August 2012 when Clinton was secretary of state. But by the time the White House confirmed that Assad crossed it about a year later, she had been replaced by John Kerry. August 2012: Obama draws the "red line." Obama first made the "red line" comment Aug. 20, 2012, when a reporter asked Obama whether he envisioned using the military in Syria, "if simply for nothing else, the safekeeping of the chemical weapons." Obama responded (emphasis added): "I have, at this point, not ordered military engagement in the situation. But the point that you made about chemical and biological weapons is critical. That’s an issue that doesn’t just concern Syria; it concerns our close allies in the region, including Israel. It concerns us. We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people. "We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation." At this point, Clinton was secretary of state. She endorsed Obama’s position, specifically using the phrase "red line" in a Dec. 3 2012, press conference in Prague. "We have made our views very clear. This is a red line for the United States," she told a reporter. "I'm not going to telegraph in any specifics what we would do in the event of credible evidence that the Assad regime has resorted to using chemical weapons against his own people, but suffice to say we are certainly planning to take action if that eventuality were to occur." "Our concerns are that an increasingly desperate Assad regime might turn to chemical weapons or might lose control of them to one of the many groups that are now operating within Syria," she said after a NATO meeting two days later. "And so as part of the absolute unity that we all have on this issue, we have sent an unmistakable message that this would cross a red line and those responsible would be held to account." Rumors that Syria was mobilizing chemical weapons also began to emerge in Clinton’s last months in office, in early 2013. In a January 2013 interview, Clinton reiterated that "the use of chemical weapons, President Obama has said, is a red line." Clinton left her position as secretary of state in February 2013. August 2013: White House "assesses with high confidence that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack." Assad’s regime killed more than 1,400 people in this chemical weapons attack in the city of Damascus. Despite his earlier "red line" comment, Obama chose not to strike Syria and instead looked to Congress to authorize force. Eventually, through a deal with Russia, Syria handed over its chemical weapons, and no strikes were fired against Assad for crossing the red line. Clinton had handed the position of secretary of state over to Kerry in February 2013. However, Clinton publicly commented on the deal with Russia on Sept. 9, 2013, amid the negotiation process. She endorsed the White House position, saying, "If the regime immediately surrendered its stockpiles to international control, as was suggested by Secretary Kerry and the Russians, that would be an important step." "This discussion that has taken hold today about potential international control over Syria’s stockpiles only could take place in the context of a credible military threat by the United States to keep pressure on the Syrian government, as well as those supporting Syria, like Russia," Clinton added, possibly alluding to the "red line" comment. She met with Obama earlier that day and had spoken with high-level members of his staff multiple times in the preceding days, according to Washington Post reports. She reiterated her support for Obama’s position on Syria again at a second speech that week. Trump’s phrasing — and the fact that Clinton interrupted him — makes it difficult to know exactly what time frame he’s referring to: Either when Obama first announced the red line or when Assad crossed the red line. However, Clinton was involved in both campaigns. Even though she was no longer part of the Obama administration when it confirmed Syria had crossed the "red line," Clinton participated in the discussions about how to respond. And she advocated for Obama’s position publicly. So when Trump said, "You were in total contact with the White House and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you" — he had a point. Our ruling Clinton said, "I was gone" when there was a red line against Syria. Clinton was secretary of state in August 2012 when Obama said if the Assad regime were to use chemical weapons, that would cross a "red line" after which Obama would consider using military force in Syria. In the months following that statement, Clinton reiterated Obama’s position, using the phrase "red line." A year later, August 2013, the White House confirmed Syria had crossed this "red line." By this point, Clinton had left the State Department months earlier. However, in the days following that revelation, Clinton met with Obama and his staff several times and publicly endorsed the White House’s position on how to respond. The claim has an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression.

pomt-04075	Social Security has nothing to do with the federal deficit.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/22/hank-johnson/congressmans-claim-mostly-misses-mark/	Editor's note: Some readers noted that employers, too, make contributions into Social Security. The article has been updated to reflect that point. Some Democrats in Washington have staked out a position that important programs such as Social Security should not be changed as part of any spending reductions. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from DeKalb County, made that point in a Twitter post. The congressman’s rationale included a claim we thought was worthwhile to fact-check. Johnson wrote on Twitter: "#socialsecurity has nothing to do with the deficit -- why are we even talking about it?" Social Security is one of the most important functions of the federal government. Social Security and Medicare account for about one-third of federal spending. In this age of trillion-dollar deficits, it would seem that Social Security is a factor in the nation’s fiscal challenges. Or is it? Uncle Sam pays about $60 billion in Social Security benefits each month to about 60 million recipients, mostly retirees who paid into the system when they were working. It’s widely believed the number of recipients will increase in the future as Americans live longer. Lawmakers are concerned that the federal government will have less money to pay recipients in the coming years. Eighty percent of the money for Social Security comes from employees, their employers and the self-employed, Johnson’s office told us. The federal government takes a percentage of the pay of most workers for Social Security. It had been 4.2 percent of the paycheck of most workers, but as you may have noticed by now, it is back to 6.2 percent after lawmakers let a cut in the payroll tax expire. Americans who make more than $106,800 don’t have to pay as much of their income, percentagewise, into the system. The second source is investment income from Social Security’s reserves, which are invested in interest-bearing U.S. Treasury bonds; raising about 15 percent of total revenue, said Johnson’s spokesman, Andy Phelan. Social Security gets about 5 percent of its revenue from the taxes that beneficiaries pay on their Social Security benefits, Phelan added. Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire recently looked at a claim that Social Security has not contributed to the debt and deficits and rated it Mostly False. They said that from 1984 to 2009, Social Security collected more money than it paid in benefits. Those surplus dollars, they reported, add to the Social Security trust funds, which currently hold about $2.7 trillion in assets. The surplus funds are often invested in U.S. Treasury bonds. Social Security, though, has been running deficits in recent years. The deficit was about $49 billion in 2010 and $45 billion in 2011, according to a 2012 Social Security trustees report. The average deficit will be about $66 billion between 2012 and 2018 as beneficiaries continue to grow at a faster rate than the number of covered workers, the report said. The cut in the payroll tax, by the way, cost the government about $100 billion in 2011 and likely the same amount in 2012, Social Security officials say. So what happens when there is a gap in what Social Security collects and pays? "When Social Security runs a deficit, the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference," PolitiFact New Hampshire wrote. Boston University economics professor Laurence Kotnikoff told PolitiFact New Hampshire that Social Security is a part of the nation’s debt and deficit challenges. "Nobody can claim Social Security isn’t part of the overall problem," he said. "It’s all labeling games. … It absolutely contributes to the overall fiscal situation. It’s in terrible shape." The Washington Post’s Fact Checker has also looked into the impact of Social Security on the federal deficit. It noted that President Barack Obama had been more precise than others when talking about the issue, saying "Social Security is not the primary driver of our long-term deficits and debt." The Post, too, reported that Social Security was providing more money than it was collecting in benefits in recent years. To sum up, Johnson’s Twitter page said Social Security has nothing to do with the federal deficit. Until 2010, that was true. But the program has run a deficit each year since then and is taking money from its bonds to cover the gap. Federal officials are also worried about the long-term impact of future deficits on the program. Johnson has a reasonable argument since Social Security is taking money from its bond interest to pay to cover the current gap. But these gaps do have an impact on other parts of the federal budget, and the projections are that the problem is going to get worse. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06654	"Today, when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/herman-cain/herman-cain-once-again-touts-galveston-retirement-/	During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., Social Security took center stage, in large part because of a dispute between former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry over Perry's comments about the retirement program. But fellow candidate Herman Cain, the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, raised another point about Social Security: He touted the performance of a plan that allowed employees of Galveston County, Texas, to opt out of Social Security and participate in a separate retirement plan. The topic came up when moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Cain, "Are you with Gov. Perry that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme?" Cain responded, "I don't care what you call it, it's broken. And here's my solution. Start with optional personal retirement accounts. In 1981, the Galveston County employees, they opted out because that was a very short window of opportunity. They took it. Today, when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security." It wasn’t the first time Cain had touted the Galveston plan. During a Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., Cain said something similar: "The city of Galveston, they opted out of the Social Security system way back in the '70s," Cain said. "And now, they retire with a whole lot more money. Why? For a real simple reason -- they have an account with their money on it. What I'm simply saying is we've got to restructure the program using a personal retirement account option in order to eventually make it solvent." We rated Cain’s previous statement about the Galveston plan Half True. His wording this time was different, but his general notion was similar -- that the Galveston plan provides its participants with benefits superior to those they would have had under Social Security. First, some background on the Galveston program, which is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. (The federal government banned such moves by local governments in 1983.) In 1981, employees of Galveston County -- as well as those in two adjoining Texas counties, Matagorda and Brazoria -- voted, after lengthy presentations and discussions, to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits. (It’s worth pointing out that the plan only affects employees of the county government -- not everyone who lives in Galveston County, as some viewers might take away from Cain’s comment.) Participants would contribute to their retirement accounts, supplemented by an amount from their employers, and those funds would be invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen by a county-run bidding process. The Alternate Plan, as it is called, was designed to supplement a separate, existing, defined-contribution pension plan known as the Texas County and District Retirement System. The Alternate Plan’s benefits are not indexed for inflation (a key difference from Social Security -- more on that below) and while each participant is assigned an individual account, the employee is not able to control investment decisions. In recent years, as various politicians have floated ideas to partially privatize Social Security, the Galveston plan has received an unusual amount of public attention. However, the primary statistics available to gauge Cain’s claim are imperfect, since they are more than a decade old. Judging which plan provides a better payout requires constructing models for various types of employees, accounting for variables such as income, the length and consistency of job tenure, marital status and the number and age of dependents. So comparing the two plans is a complex undertaking, and the most thorough independent examinations of the question -- a pair of 1999 studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Social Security Administration -- do not appear to have been updated in the past dozen years. We’ll first explain what GAO and SSA concluded in 1999, then look at what variables must be taken into account before applying their 12-year-old conclusions to today. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas summarized in an item published in December 2010, participants who had higher earnings and fewer or no dependents generally fared better under the Galveston plan, particularly over the near term. But workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security. This stems from the plans’ divergent designs. The Galveston plan is somewhat analogous to a 401(k) plan -- that is, a plan designed to encourage workers to save for retirement -- rather than a social insurance, or safety-net, program like Social Security. "Social Security is a social insurance program designed, in part, to provide a basic level of retirement income to help retired workers, disabled workers and their dependents and survivors stay out of poverty," GAO wrote in 1999. As a result, GAO said, Social Security benefits "are tilted to provide relatively higher benefits to low-wage earners" than they would have received based on what they put into the system. There is no such redistributive mechanism in the Alternate Plan. If you have a higher salary and put more money into the system, you’ll get more out of it -- perhaps even more than Social Security would provide, GAO and SSA concluded. But if you are on the low end of the income scale, Social Security will give you a relatively better payout at retirement, compared with the Alternate Plan. There’s another important factor to note. Because the Alternate Plan lacks inflation protection -- unlike Social Security, which increases benefits annually if there’s inflation in consumer prices -- the studies found a serious risk that Alternate Plan beneficiaries will fare worse over time than if they had received Social Security and its built-in cost-of-living increases. (The specific scenarios outlined in the studies are highly varied; readers who want more details should read the reports directly.) The takeaway from the GAO and SSA studies is that the Galveston plan can be better than Social Security -- if you’re better off and if you fall into certain specific demographic categories. For many workers, especially those who are paid less, Social Security provides more. This result doesn’t directly conflict with Cain’s statement, but it does undermine the sweeping certitude with which he said that "when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security." "It's a great plan if you have worked under the plan for many years, if you do not die and leave any dependents, if you are not divorced from someone covered in the plan and if you are not interested in having your retirement income stream protected against inflation," said Eric Kingson, a professor at Syracuse University's School of Social Work and a longtime skeptic of the plan. "Short-term workers who leave the plan receive little if any benefits for their work and do not have their years under the Galveston Plan covered by Social Security. Low-income working persons do not receive anything approaching the kind of protection they receive under Social Security." Keith Brainard, the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed that the Galveston plan is better for some types of workers, including those with long tenures. But the "problem," he said, "lies in Cain’s implication that Social Security should be a wealth-producing vehicle, when that’s not what it’s supposed to be. Social Security is supposed to be old-age insurance. That should be the emphasis of the program, not ‘retiring with a lot more money.’" As we noted, the GAO and SSA studies are old. How do they hold up? As it turns out, they may bolster or even strengthen the case for Social Security. The 1999 studies were conducted at a time of higher returns in the marketplace. The Galveston plan invests conservatively -- by design and from the beginning -- in annuity contracts with a guaranteed rate of return, rather than stocks. So the Galveston system is insulated from much market volatility. Still, even these safer financial vehicles have seen ramped-down returns in the current economic climate. Because of prevailing low interest rates, the contracts now provide the minimum rate of return that was negotiated as a floor in 1981 -- either 3.75 percent or 4 percent annually, said Rick Gornto, president of First Financial Benefits Inc., who has operated the Galveston plan for 30 years. That’s lower than the 1999 GAO and SSA studies had projected. And that’s notable, because when the 1999 studies came out, plan supporters criticized the reports for assuming lower returns than the plan had produced historically, thus unfairly selling the plan short compared to Social Security. "These studies assumed a low 4 percent return, which is the minimum rate of return on annuities guaranteed by the insurance companies," wrote Judge Ray Holbrook, who oversaw the creation and administration of the Galveston plan, and Alcestis "Cooky" Oberg in a 2005 paper for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank that has been a longtime supporter of the plan. Holbrook and Oberg wrote that as of 2005, the average annual rate of return had been "about 6.5 percent over 24 years." Our reading of the SSA study is that they actually assumed a 5.55 percent rate of return for the Galveston plan. The figure used in the GAO study was not specified. Either way, the rates of return for the Alternate Plan are either equal to or lower than the 1999 studies had assumed. That would either bolster the 1999 conclusions or put the Alternate Plan at a disadvantage if such a comparison were made today. (Rates of return for Social Security depend on a person’s individual economic history, so there is no simple apples-to-apples comparison to make. That’s why comprehensive, model-based analyses like the GAO’s and the SSA's are necessary.) Now we’ll add some caveats. Retirement plans can only be judged on long-term returns, so today’s low rates may be putting the Galveston plan in an unusually poor light on the specific issue Cain highlighted. There’s nothing to say that the Galveston rates won’t rise in the future. In addition, there are some advantages to the Galveston plan -- not just to the higher earners who get more out of the program, but also to the government entity running them. The Alternate Plan doesn’t face the same kind of long-term fiscal challenges that Social Security does, because it only promises participants the investment returns for the money they pay in to the system. The downside, of course, is that the investments may not perform well enough to exceed what Social Security would have provided. In addition, some commentators have said that structural reasons would prevent a Galveston-type plan from being a good model on a national level, even if it were deemed to work well in a local context. But that debate is beyond the scope of this article. On the specific question Cain raised -- whether participants in Galveston will "retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security" -- the answer is, "it depends." According to studies published a dozen years ago, some will, and some won’t. And the outlook today for the Galveston plan’s rate of return -- while not immutable going forward -- is more downbeat than it was in 1999. On balance, we rate Cain’s statement Half True.

pomt-13182	"Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/oct/26/john-rafferty/gop-attorney-general-candidate-cant-back-claim-wid/	Correction appended Somehow, we’re still talking about whether or not voter fraud is widespread in Pennsylvania. And once again, we’ll repeat: Most studies and experts say it’s not. During a debate televised on 6ABC on Oct. 16, Republican candidate for Pennsylvania attorney general and state Sen. John Rafferty was in the process of bolstering his calls for a statewide voter ID provision when he implied "illegal" voting in Pennsylvania is widespread. "Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth," he said during the debate. His opponent, Democratic candidate and Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro, shot back "That’s just simply not true" to which Rafferty responded: "Read the papers." Concerns about voter fraud and illegal voting in Pennsylvania have been a major concern this election, especially as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has circulated factually inaccurate claims about voter fraud in Philadelphia. So we decided to check Rafferty’s claim. His campaign provided PolitiFact with three citations to back up his claim that the media has recently reported on "thousands" of instances of illegal voting in the commonwealth. The first wasa nearly two-year-old report in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which reported that more than 700 Pennsylvanians may have cast two ballots or voted elsewhere in the 2012 general election. In that year, about six million votes were recorded in Pennsylvania, meaning those 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.0001 percent of the vote. President Obama won the state by 300,000 votes. The story cited Carol Aichele, Pennsylvania’s former Secretary of State and a proponent of the implementation of voter ID laws. (She oversaw its passage in Pennsylvania and testified in the trial that ultimately led to the state Supreme Court ruling the measure unconstitutional.) At the time, Aichele told the newspaper that more than 700 Pennsylvania voters had the "potential" to cast two ballots in the election. Experts say double voting is actually quite rare. A report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law noted that accusations of widespread double voting are often couched with a "might" and are probably more common than actual double voting. "These cases are extremely rare — not because such documentation is hard to come by (many states require that such documents be retained), but because actual double voting is itself extremely rare," author Justin Levitt wrote in the report. "Moreover, the scarcity is expected, given the severity of the penalty (criminal prosecution), and the meager nature of the payoff (one incremental vote)." The second media report cited by the Rafferty campaign was a January story by The Philadelphia Daily News about three former Philadelphia elections officials pleading guilty to violating the state election code. The story refers to two separate examples of voter fraud. The first was a case of a poll worker who cast a vote for her 23-year-old son in the 2015 primary. The second stemmed from the 2014 primary, in which the defendant voted for her mother. The final citation provided by the Rafferty campaign was a New York Times story detailing a fraud scheme in Philadelphia that encouraged hundreds of voters to cast absentee ballots even though they didn’t have a legal reason to. The story was from February 1994. Those examples don’t add up to "recent" media reports about thousands of voters casting illegal ballots in Pennsylvania. PolitiFact was able to find two additional media reports that did cite "thousands" of illegal voters in Pennsylvania. The first of those reports was an Oct. 11 report titled "Potentially Thousands of Illegal Voters in Pennsylvania" and was published by LifeZette, a website founded by conservative pundit Laura Ingraham. It cited an incident where mailers were sent to thousands of Pennsylvania voters — including, potentially, some undocumented immigrants — inviting residents to register to vote. It didn’t actually register them. The second report was published this week — notably after Rafferty made his claim during the 6ABC debate — and was titled: "Proof: Thousands of GOP votes likely stolen in Pa." It was published by WorldNetDaily, a conservative news and commentary website founded by Joseph Farah, a noted "birther," or person who believes President Obama was not born in the United States. That story’s "proof" was a widely-debunked theory about 2012 voting in Philadelphia. Elections officials in Pennsylvania say widespread illegal voting is often cited during contentious elections and conversations about implementing voter ID requirements but isn’t particularly common. A 2012 report on voting irregularities in Philadelphia suggests most are a result of clerical errors. Our Ruling During a 6ABC debate, candidate for attorney general John Rafferty said "Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth." To back up that claim, the campaign provided three citations: One of which was 22 years old and not recent, one that was related to instances of voter fraud that netted an additional two votes and one that suggested about 700 voters had the "potential" to vote twice, but there wasn’t evidence those individuals actually did. Those do not add up to the media "recently" reporting on "thousands" of instances of illegal voting. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. This article was corrected to reflect that in the 2012 general election 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.01 percent of the vote.

pomt-07347	"Austin Energy is considering its first rate increase since 1994."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/10/kathie-tovo/kathie-tovo-says-austin-energy-considering-first-r/	Answering a question for the May 1 "Voters Guide" from the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, City Council hopeful Kathie Tovo made us check our pocketbooks. Tovo said: "Austin Energy," the city’s electric utility, " is considering its first rate increase since 1994." We wondered about that, since our first thought was that surely electric bills went up during that time. Tovo’s campaign manager, Mark Yznaga, told us Tovo was referring to the utility’s base charge for electricity. News reports and posts on Austin Energy’s website show hearings are expected to culminate in the City Council considering a rate bump as soon as later this year. The utility says in a January "Austin Energy Rate Review" newsletter that since 1994, it’s added more than 100,000 customers, experienced big increases in the cost of materials and services and added business functions while expanding others such as energy efficiency and solar rebate programs. At the same time, the article says growth in Austin Energy electric sales has trended downward of late, requiring the utility to dip into its reserves for operations. Echoing the newsletter article, Austin Energy spokesman Ed Clark told us the base electric rate, covering the costs of staff, the electric system, power plants, vehicles and the like, has not changed since 1994. It’s 3.55 cents for each of the first 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity used and 7.82 cents for each additional kilowatt-hour. Clark said customers also pay an unchanged $6 monthly service charge, Yet that doesn’t mean they’ve paid the same amount for electricity every year. Their bills include such variables as a fee for statewide transmission costs added by the Texas Public Utility Commission in November plus a fluctuating fee tied to ups and downs in fuel costs. At our request, Clark told us what an average residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month would have been billed each August from 1994 through 2011. For the period, we calculate, the fuel charge averaged 2.322 cents per kilowatt-hour, though it’s exceeded that every year from 2004 on. In 1994, the bill for 1,000 kilowatt-hours would have been $79.14. In 2010, the bill for using that much electricity was $100.20 -- an increase of 27 percent. In August 2011, the same usage would be billed $94.72, due to a drop in the fuel charge. Put another way, the 2011 charge looks to be 20 percent more than what it cost a customer using the same amount of electricity in 1994. A-ha! Is it really fair to say Austin Energy’s rates have not increased since 1994? Well, we realized, our comparison failed to consider inflation over the years. According to our check using the Consumer Price Index inflation calculator posted online by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2011 bill actually ends up about $15 less than the comparable 1994 bill. When we ran this by Austin economist Stuart Greenfield, he pointed out that according to a finer inflation adjustment tied to household energy prices, the average August 2010 bill was about $33 less than what it was in 1994. At a glance, still, Tovo’s statement could leave the misimpression that utility customers haven’t had to dig out more dollars for electricity since 1994. They have. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04336	Lois Frankel "spent over $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/25/adam-hasner/lois-frankels-mayoral-bathroom-takes-hit-adam-hasn/	The battle between congressional candidates Lois Frankel and Adam Hasner has fallen into the toilet. Democrat Frankel and Republican Hasner are competing in the South Florida Congressional 22 district that is currently home to U.S. Rep. Allen West who has switched districts. In Hasner’s ad "Gotta Go" the incensed female narrator says: "That Lois Frankel is something. She gave herself a 40 percent pay raise. Charged us for a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party. But the worst part? Frankel spent over $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet. What a waste. All that money right down the drain for her own personal use," says the narrator, as a close-up of her hand is shown flushing a white toilet. Now the screen reveals that our narrator is sitting on a toilet next to a roll of toilet paper and a white shower curtain: "When you gotta go, you gotta go, but that’s just ridiculous." We’ve already checked a PAC claim about whether Frankel gave herself a 40 percent pay raise while the city lost jobs (Half True) and Hasner’s claim that she took a ride in a helicopter ride to a party (Half True). Here we go for a deep dive about that taxpayer-funded bathroom. We will focus our fact-check on whether Frankel spent $13,000 on a marble shower in a private bathroom at City Hall. We will also touch on why she got that bathroom and how it ended up with marble. The origin of the bathroom claim Frankel suggested that PolitiFact personally inspect the bathroom which is now in the office of mayor Jeri Muoio. So we traveled to inspect the bathroom in West Palm Beach city hall on Oct. 22. The bathroom does have beige marble on the floor and a stand-up shower. Large marble tiles cover the main part of the bathroom floor and the shower walls. The bathroom also has a standard white toilet, a sink and narrow cherry wood shelves for towels and plastic blinds over the windows. It looks like a bathroom in a new hotel, but it’s not luxurious or palatial. (View photos from the Palm Beach Post.) First, some background about the city hall which was part of a controversial $150 million City Center project that included a library, photo center and parking garage. Frankel was a leader in getting the project built but in West Palm Beach the mayor only votes if there is a tie. That means that the City Commission voted to build the project. City spokesman Elliot Cohen said there were multiple votes about the project but no tie votes. Hasner’s campaign notes that when Frankel broke a tie to fill a commission vacancy in 2006 she chose a City Center supporter. The bathroom controversy started with media coverage about the new city hall from then Palm Beach Post gossip columnist Jose Lambiet. (He now has his own website and writes a column for the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.) "Yes, marble, as in most Palm Beach mansions. In the middle of a recession," Lambiet wrote in 2009. "Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer!" The column quoted Frankel: "In the big scheme of things, it was probably a minuscule cost," Frankel said. "I didn't ask for it. The designer did. I don't even know if I'll ever use the shower. But this building was constructed to last 100 years, and it's not been built for me. It's been built for mayors after me." Lambiet wrote several weeks later that a statement by the builder, Dan Catalfumo, showed that the "bathroom/shower" in Frankel’s office cost $13,323. The cost for plumbing the entire city hall was $1.6 million and the value of stone and tiles was $1.2 million, Lambiet wrote. "For privacy, security, and job efficiency reasons, the designers included a private bath within the mayor's office," Frankel spokesman Chase Scott said at the time. "It is a small, commercial grade facility, and its cost was in the same range as the other bathrooms in city hall." Scott no longer works for the city, but when PolitiFact Florida contacted him, he said Frankel did not request the marble. "Lois Frankel did not design or have any input into the materials used, as they were all selected by the architect. I know this because at the time City Center was completed we gave tours, and I needed all the design information," Scott told us in an email. Scott said he had requested the bathroom be part of the mayor’s office because mayors work into the evening, are often outdoors in the heat, and have to hold press conferences, "I believed it was a good idea for all future mayors to have the ability to freshen up, as their office is often their real home." Did the shower cost $13,000? Hasner's ad states that the shower alone cost $13,000, but we couldn’t find any documents to support that claim. Lambiet said he no longer had that builder’s statement from 2009, and we could not reach Catalfumo. (He now has much bigger problems.) Frankel’s campaign sent us to two sources -- project architect Young Song and project executive J.J. Wolfe who worked with Catalfumo. "We never designed a marble shower," said architect Young Song. According to the plans, the mayor’s bathroom was supposed to be tile. Wolfe said he used marble that was left over from another job, so it didn’t add to the project tab. "We thought we are doing something nice, and it turned into big fiasco. The marble was free, so it seemed like a reasonable thing to do at time," Wolfe said. "If I could take back, I would put in the ugliest pink polka-dotted tile in there I could come up with." Wolfe said $13,000 for the shower was an inflated figure that didn’t reflect the actual costs. It was based on an average for the bathroom that the builder came up with based on the plumbing, figures and materials, Wolfe said. Frankel said that in the old city hall, people would sometimes follow her into the bathroom, which was a security risk. In case of hurricanes, mayors have to work around the clock, too. So while she didn’t ask for the private bathroom, she didn’t veto it, either. "I thought it was a good idea, and I still do," she said. She left her successor a shower cap when she left office in 2011. Hasner’s bathroom access To be fair, we researched the bathroom access Hasner had when he was a state legislator including House Majority leader. He had no special private bathroom, his campaign said. "There is no bathroom in the Majority Leader's personal office or the larger majority office, said Ryan Duffy, spokesman for the House speaker. "The closest bathroom is the public bathroom in the hallway outside the majority office." Our ruling At last, we are ready to close the lid on this claim. Hasner’s ad said that Frankel "spent $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom." The underlying message here is that Frankel engaged in government waste. But Frankel didn’t have some sort of sole power here to make that bathroom happen. It was part of a much broader $150 million project approved by the City Commission. The city built a new city hall while Frankel was mayor that included a private bathroom for her. A gossip columnist obtained a statement from the builder at the time that said the "bathroom/shower" cost $13,323. We were unable to see that statement for ourselves. Hasner’s campaign says the shower alone cost $13,000. But the project executive who worked for the builder said that was the cost of the overall bathroom. And the builder decided to use that marble -- which wasn’t in the architect’s plans -- because it was leftover from another job. There is no evidence that Frankel ordered up that marble. Whether a mayor needs a private bathroom and shower with or without marble is a decision we leave for the taxpayers. But we have seen no proof that the shower alone cost $13,000 -- that appears to be the overall price tag for the bathroom which was part of a $150 million project. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00019	Trump supporters are heading to the border as the migrant caravan approaches.	true	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/08/blog-posting/yes-armed-us-civilians-are-headed-border/	Days after false claims that Beto O’Rourke was illegally using campaign funds to help the migrant caravan, the Patriot Journal published a "special report" on Nov. 5 announcing that supporters of President Donald Trump were en route to meet the migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. "Even Donald didn’t expect his supporters would take matters into their own hands," begins a story about armed civilians heading south as Central American migrants continue their march north. "After Democrats caught funding caravan, Trump supporters send a swift response," the headline says. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The piece seems to be based on another story that’s quoted in the article and attributed to MSN. "Gun-carrying civilian groups and border vigilantes have heard a call to arms in President Trump’s warnings about threats to American security posed by caravans of Central American migrants moving through Mexico," the excerpt says. "They’re packing coolers and tents, oiling rifles and tuning up aerial drones, with plans to form caravans of their own and trail American troops to the border." Turns out that story, though published on MSN’s website, is actually by The Washington Post. The newspaper goes on to report that Shannon McGauley, president of the Texas Minutemen, was then preparing to head from the Dallas area for the Rio Grande to defend the country against what Trump has called "an invasion." McGauley said the Texas Minutemen have 100 volunteers on their way to the Rio Grande "who want to help stop the migrants, with more likely on the way," according to the Post. McGauley said he couldn’t put a number on how big the group will ultimately be. On Nov. 2, the Washington Post also reported that U.S. military leaders are concerned about the presence of "unregulated armed militia" groups turning up in areas where U.S. troops will operate. The paper couldn’t independently confirm the report’s authenticity, the story says, "but military officials did not dispute its veracity." U.S. Army documents obtained by Newsweek and published on its website on Nov. 1 report an "estimated 200 unregulated armed militia members currently operating along the southwest border." Rumblings about militia groups trying to stop the migrant caravan date back to at least late October. The Associated Press reported that month that militia members and far-right activists were raising money and airing plans to head to the border. Border Patrol warned some Texas landowners that "possible armed civilians" could come onto their property because of the caravan, according to the AP. On Nov. 4, Willamette Week, an alternative newspaper in Portland, reported that, like the Texas Minutemen, Oregon militia members say they’re also going to the border. But the weekly cautioned against reading too much into the claims of militia members. It cited a tweet from J.J. MacNab, an expert on U.S. paramilitary militia groups and anti-government extremist organizations: "Reporters should keep in mind that militia members talk tough online but rarely actually show up," she said. P.J. Tobia, a producer for VICE News Tonight, piggybacked on that sentiment, tweeting: "I spoke to a lot of militia folks this week. Almost all are staying home. The ones on the border already are mostly from nearby and would be there anyway. And ALWAYS take their self-reported headcounts with much salt." Our ruling It’s unclear how many militia group members will wind up at the border in addition to the couple hundred the Army estimates are already there. Still, news reports indicate that action is afoot, even if it’s just collecting cash for the cause. One Oregon woman said she had raised about $4,000 online before Halloween to help militias buy supplies, according to the AP. We rate this claim True.

pomt-02503	"Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce," which is more than the number "of people working in the fossil fuel industry."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/14/tammy-baldwin/expansive-definition-helps-green-jobs-outnumber-oi/	The notion of counting the number of "green" jobs in America made us think, oddly enough, of a middle-age guy trying for cool by pairing a sport coat with blue jeans. Not easy. Yet quite matter-of-factly, while touting a clean energy jobs bill she introduced, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin made the following statement Jan. 22, 2014: "Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce, including in clean energy and sustainability, which is more than the amount of people working in the fossil fuel industry." When we put the Wisconsin Democrat’s claim to Daniel Kish at the Institute for Energy Research, he told us that both green and fossil fuel industry job numbers are sometimes thrown around with abandon. "This gets really dicey real quick," he said. "Everybody’s got their dueling banjos." That’s PolitiFact Wisconsin’s kind of music. Baldwin’s evidence To back his boss’ claim, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus cited two reports. Both are from solid sources, though they mix sports coats and -- er, apples and oranges -- a bit. 1. Federal report In 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics embarked on an annual tally of green jobs. The agency had the advantage of considering a definition of green jobs proffered a year earlier by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank, which produced its own green jobs count. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed 120,000 business and government establishments within 325 industries that were "identified as potentially producing green goods or providing green services." Those surveyed said whether they produced green goods and services and the percentage of their revenue or employment associated with that output. Green goods and services were defined as those that "benefit the environment or conserve natural resources." They fall into one or more of the following five groups: 1) Production of energy from renewable sources; 2) energy efficiency; 3) pollution reduction and removal, greenhouse gas reduction, and recycling and reuse; 4) natural resources conservation; and 5) environmental compliance, education and training, and public awareness. So, the list of green jobs is quite varied, including jobs in areas such as farming; home construction; electric, solar and other types of power generation; petroleum and coal products manufacturing; urban mass transit; newspaper publishing; advertising and public relations services; waste treatment and disposal; museums and zoos; and social advocacy organizations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics produced its second -- and, it turns out, final -- green jobs report in March 2013. It estimated that "employment associated with the production of green goods and services" -- full- and part-time jobs -- exceeded 3.4 million in 2011. Manufacturing, with 507,000 green jobs, was the largest sector. Goods produced by those jobs included air conditioning and refrigeration equipment meeting selected standards, hybrid cars and parts, and pollution mitigation equipment. Kish, who is senior vice president for policy at the industry-backed Institute for Energy Research, pointed out that 886,000 of the 3.4 million were government jobs -- not jobs, he said, in which people are "making or installing windmills and solar panels." "Green," Kish said, is a "political word, used by politicians and advocates, that is truly elusive." Nevertheless, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is well-established as the official jobs counter for the federal government. The 2013 report, for the number of green jobs in 2011, remains the latest available. That report said that because of budget cuts, no more green counts would be done. 2. Think tank study The Brookings Institution report we noted above was produced in 2011, so it’s a little dated. Brookings estimated that in 2010, there were 2.7 million green jobs -- that is, jobs that "directly contributed to the production of goods and services that had an environmental beneﬁt." Brookings didn’t do a count of fossil fuel industry jobs, but it did make a comparison using federal government tallies. Its report said that in 2010, there were 1.3 million jobs that directly supported "the production of fossil fuel-based energy, derivative manufactured products and machinery." If all wholesale and retail distributors, transporters and other workers -- such as gas station employees -- were included, the fossil fuel tally would be 2.4 million jobs, Brookings said. Brookings scholar Jonathan Rothwell told us some critics view the think tank’s definition of green jobs as too expansive. For example, some 350,000 public transportation jobs in the green tally include not only bus drivers but secretaries, janitors, executives and all other employees who work for bus companies, he said. Brookings' definition of green jobs "was very broad and included any economic activity that has an environmental benefit -- from public transportation to waste management," Rothwell acknowledged, adding that because "only a small portion of energy comes from green sources, fossil fuel employees are a much larger share of the energy sector's workforce." But Rothwell noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics adopted a similar definition when it did green jobs counts. And we note that BLS arrived at a roughly similar green jobs estimate. So, the most recent federal report backs the first part of Baldwin’s statement, that there are more than 3 million green jobs. The older think tank report she cites doesn’t say there were more than 3 million green jobs, but does say that green jobs outnumbered fossil fuel industry jobs as of 2010. Other views One thing to underline here is that counting green jobs is a different sort of animal. As CNN/Money observed when the first Bureau of Labor Statistics green jobs report came out in 2012, comparing "green jobs to another singular sector isn't really fair. The green jobs survey took into account a wide variety of jobs in over 300 different industries." As for the oil and gas industry itself, a July 2013 report was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and natural gas industry, that was an update of a report done two years earlier. The later report said there were 2.59 million jobs in the oil and natural gas industry in 2011. PricewaterhouseCoopers said it utilized data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau for its study. The study noted that the oil and natural gas industry "encompasses a number of activities that span separate industry classifications in government economic data." For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production is included in the mining sector; and oil refining is part of the manufacturing sector. The study defined the oil and gas industry to include all such activities. The petroleum institute noted to us criticism of how the federal government defines green jobs, including an editorial in Investor’s Business Daily that called the annual count "phony." A final note: In November 2012, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, made a claim similar to but more broad than Baldwin’s, saying there were "more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country." That was before the latest reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and American Petroleum Institute that estimated green and fossil fuel jobs for 2011. PolitiFact Rhode Island rated the statement True. Our colleagues noted that at the time, the number of green jobs as estimated by BLS exceeded the number of oil and gas jobs estimated by the petroleum institute. Our rating Baldwin said: "Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce," which is more than the number "of people working in the fossil fuel industry." The latest estimates are for 2011. The federal government says there were 3.4 million green jobs, while a national oil and gas trade group says there were 2.59 million oil and gas jobs.

pomt-04257	Says a poll shows that "without a name attached, Democrats are just one point behind" Gov. John Kasich.	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/14/chris-redfern/chris-redfern-says-poll-shows-support-nameless-dem/	One election season ends, another begins. Riding high the day after President Barack Obama’s re-election last week, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern sharpened his rhetorical knives for 2014. Yes, 2014. That’s when Republican Gov. John Kasich will be up for a second term. For months the state’s political observers have buzzed with speculation about which Democrats might challenge him. With the presidential race in the books, expect to hear even more chatter in the coming weeks. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, whom Kasich ousted in 2010, soon will make his intentions known. Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald also hopes to announce a decision by year’s end. Others in the mix include former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of the Youngstown area and recently defeated U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton of Copley Township. So it was little surprise to hear Redfern, in a post-election victory lap, slam Kasich’s leadership as "corrosive." He also said his party is in strong position for 2014, regardless of its nominee. "Without a name attached, Democrats are just one point behind," Redfern said. Redfern based the statement on numbers provided by Public Policy Polling, or PPP, a firm affiliated with Democrats. Eager for some insight on the nascent gubernatorial race, PolitiFact Ohio decided to explore the party chairman’s claim by looking at those numbers and others. To better understand where Kasich stands today, consider where he was a year ago this month. Voters had overwhelmingly rejected Senate Bill 5, a package of collective bargaining restrictions championed by Republican leaders in Columbus. A PPP poll had measured Kasich’s job approval rating at 33 percent. The polling firm also had found that, if given a mulligan on the 2010 election, Ohio voters would have backed Strickland over Kasich, 55 percent to 37 percent. Bottom line: Kasich spent his first year in office as one of the nation’s most unpopular governors. But after the calendar flipped to 2012, Kasich’s popularity slowly began to climb. Pundits generally tie his rising political fortunes to voter confidence in Ohio’s rising economic fortunes. In June, PPP pegged Kasich’s approval rating at 40 percent. The pollsters also asked voters about hypothetical matchupsbetween Kasich and several Democrats. The results showed the incumbent in statistical dead heats with Strickland and Cordray and with more comfortable leads over Ryan, Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich. Considering Kasich’s results against Strickland and Cordray, PPP declared him "already in trouble." As for Coleman and Kucinich, there have been no rumblings about either, though Coleman briefly ran six years ago and the redistricted Kucinich will be out of Congress next year. More recently, other organizations have shown Kasich’s approval rating near or above 50 percent. Late last month Kasich scored a 56 percent in The Plain Dealer/Ohio Newspaper Poll and a 49 percent in a survey by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn. PPP last checked in on Kasich for a pre-Election Day survey -- the poll that Redfern referenced. Of the 1,000 likely Ohio voters questioned, 45 percent approved of Kasich’s job performance. Forty percent disapproved while another 15 percent responded that they were not sure. Unlike the June survey, in which voters were asked about potential Democratic rivals by name, this latest PPP poll generically framed the question regarding Kasich’s prospects. Respondents were asked: "Generally speaking, if there was an election for governor today, would you vote for Republican John Kasich or his Democratic opponent?" Forty-four percent picked Kasich, 43 percent chose the Democrat. The remaining 13 percent were not sure. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Incidentally, the same poll had Obama leading in Ohio by 5 points; according to unofficial election results, he beat Mitt Romney by 2. It is undeniable that Kasich’s popularity has risen since his rocky first year. It also is worth noting that while a PPP poll one year ago showed Strickland thrashing Kasich in a rematch, the governor has rebounded to the point where he’s essentially tied with a nameless challenger. In other words, when it comes to this race, Democrats are not trending upward. Redfern never asserted otherwise. Rather, the state party chairman accurately explained where things stood: A polling firm, which he clearly cited, showed a generic Democrat trailing Kasich by 1 point. A lot can change between now and November 2014. But polls, especially one this far out, should be looked at as a snapshot in time. So on the Truth-O-Meter, Redfern’s statement rates True.

pomt-07878	Says an EPA permit "languished" under Strickland but his new EPA director got it done in two days.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/07/john-kasich/gov-john-kasichs-boast-rapid-problem-solving-overl/	Gov. John Kasich wanted to make a splash. The swashbuckling Ohio governor wanted to show Ohio’s business community he was serious about his vow to speed up the permitting process at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Kasich found just such an opportunity when an air pollution permit for an Eastern Ohio energy company, Mingo Junction Energy Center (MJEC), was granted during his first week in office. At a news conference on his fifth day in office, the Republican governor described the air permit as having "languished" under the previous administration and was incredulous that EPA officials had "held the darn thing up for over 20 months." Kasich implied that EPA paper-pushers had been negligent. "It’s just bureaucracy. It’s a lack of commitment and a lack of vision." Kasich praised his new EPA director, Scott Nally, for acting quickly to get the permit issued. "This is a fact — it was over 20 months they couldn’t get an agreement, he did it in 48 hours," Kasich boasted. PolitiFact Ohio found that claim startling — and just the kind of thing to assess. We contacted Chris Abbruzzese, the EPA’s director of communications, who said the governor’s characterization was accurate because no agreement had been reached under former Gov. Ted Strickland and in a "48-hour window" Nally had managed to work out a deal. He did note that the Strickland administration spent 19 months on the permit, rather than 20, as the governor said. Abbruzzese said Nally asked Bob Hodanbosi, chief of the Division of Air Pollution Control, top permit writer Mike Hopkins and other staffers to tackle 27 technical issues that remained on the permit request. They whittled that down to just a pair of issues by the close of the business day on Jan 12. During an hour-long call on the morning of Jan 13, Nally, Hodanbosi, Hopkins and the company’s lawyer Ken Komoroski were able to sort out those last two issues. All that was left that night was for staff attorneys for each side to "trade documents and get the final language in place," according to Abbruzzese. Next, we looked at what was accomplished on the project under Strickland. An internal memo from Hodanbosi to Nally on Jan. 12 told us that a draft permit was issued in November 2010 following more than 35 weekly conference calls and meetings with the company. The discussions and joint development of the permit by EPA staff and the company concerned exactly how to allow the company to burn coke-oven gas from a steel-making process instead of "flaring it off" into the atmosphere. After receiving comments from the company during the 30-day draft period that lasted until mid-December 2010, the EPA "revised the final permit twice to try and address their concerns and was ready to issue the final permit" during Strickland’s last week in office, Hodanbosi wrote. But the company balked at some of the language in the permit, so it wasn’t issued while Strickland was in office. "The company responded on Jan. 7, 2011, that they did not want the permit issued as written," reads the memo. Chris Korleski, who preceded Nally as head of the state EPA under Strickland, said the project was "almost finished" and required only a few tweaks. "The vast bulk of a tremendous amount of work was done already when I left," Korleski. The former director said that Kasich had unfairly portrayed his team as indifferent bureaucrats. "This was not a poster child for anything wrong that Ohio EPA did," Korleski said. "The staff bent over backwards to the point of rushing two sets of orders allowing them to keep operating in the absence of the permit." He added: "They got it worked out on a phone call in an hour? That tells me the issues weren’t terribly complex or terribly difficult." Bob Smith, a Maryland attorney and partner with Venable LLP who has three decades of experience working on air pollution permits including some for steel plants and co-generation facilities, had a similar view. Speaking in general terms, Smith said typically you are "very close" to issuing the final permit once the draft permit has been issued, particularly when there aren't any comments (as was the case here) from the public or outside parties to consider. Smith said having the permit applicant request changes of a draft permit is pretty standard. "Those kinds of requests are not at all uncommon," he said. "It can take agency personnel a bit of time to digest them," he said. He said normally it would take a few weeks or a month to wrap up the process. Any changes during a final 48-hour period would be "last-minute fine-tuning to make sure the permit was appropriately clear," he said. "It's a process that only happens at the end of a very long process. A longer time period (than 48 hours) would have been required to deal with the bigger issues." So to sum up, there is a sliver of truth to what Kasich said, as more than 19 months had elapsed with no final agreement in place. And the finishing touches to the permit were clearly put on the project by staff being pushed by Nally in the two-day time frame. But, given the work that was done during those 19 months, and that the company was the roadblock to the permit being completed while Strickland was still governor, Kasich’s complaint of a "lack of commitment" from staffers as the reason for the project taking so long doesn’t ring true. And, Kasich’s contention at the news conference that "they couldn’t get an agreement" for 20 months that Nally got in 48 hours is an oversimplification, particularly since a draft permit was issued in mid-November, and state officials were ready to issue a final permit while Strickland was still in office. Those are critical facts that would give the listener a different impression of the governor’s statement. That’s why we rate Kasich’s claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14881	Income inequality "seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/rand-paul/debate-rand-paul-says-income-inequality-worse-citi/	Where do you find income inequality? In cities run by Democrats, said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. "I think we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst," Paul said during the fourth Republican presidential debate, hosted by Fox Business Network Nov. 10. "It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats." We fact-checked a similar claim Paul made last year and found it to be Half True. Let’s revisit what we uncovered. We used a 2014 study by the Brookings Institution that ranked the top 10 and bottom 10 cities by income inequality. Brookings updated the report in March 2015, and there were a couple changes to the rankings (based on 2013 data). We’ll go with the updated list. There appears to be something to what Paul said. Of the study’s 10 most unequal cities, nine have Democratic mayors. They are Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis. Only one, Miami, has a Republican mayor. By contrast, five of the 10 most equal cities have Republican mayors -- Albuquerque; Oklahoma City; Mesa, Ariz.; Colorado Springs, Colo.; and Virginia Beach, Va. The other five either have a nonpartisan mayor (Raleigh, N.C.; Las Vegas; and Arlington, Texas) or a Democrat (Columbus and Nashville). So on the numbers, Paul has a point. The question is, does this factoid mean anything? Experts we spoke to urged taking the claim with a grain of salt -- if not a whole shaker. Here are a few reasons why. Mayors aren’t all-powerful players in the local economy. Where claims of this sort are made, PolitiFact tries to establish whether credit or blame is deserved. In this case, then, is it reasonable to attribute patterns of inequality exclusively, or even primarily, to a mayor? No -- many factors play into a city’s economic success. The mayor of Detroit doesn’t have much power over the international market for automobiles, and no mayor of New York can take all the credit for the economic juggernaut of Wall Street. While mayoral policies may have an effect on the margins, such factors as the state and national business cycle, broad demographic patterns and international business trends tend to have a much greater impact on economic inequality in cities. In addition, it’s worth remembering that "cities attract people on the basis of many factors, of which the party of their political leaders is probably a minor one," said William Frey, a senior fellow in Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program. Inequality patterns in cities may be at least as much about population size and geographic patterns as they are about partisan leadership. Focusing on the partisan differences obscures a more fundamental difference between the most and least unequal cities. The more unequal cities tend to be very big, and the less unequal cities tend to be more modestly sized. The median population of the 10 most unequal cities on the Brookings list is more than 700,000, compared to about 430,000 for the most equal cities. (If you use the mean instead, the average population of the 10 most unequal cities would be even higher -- 1.9 million versus 500,000.) So it’s not exactly apples-to-apples if you compare the attributes of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on the one hand with those of Colorado Springs, Virginia Beach and Arlington on the other. All other things being equal, larger cities tend to have a wider distribution of incomes on both extremes, since they have more residents. That, almost by definition, means larger ratios between the top and the bottom. In the meantime, big cities tend to attract more wealthy people -- i.e., people who can choose to live anywhere they want -- because megacities are likelier to have world-class amenities. "The real wealth ‘peaks’ tend to be in the big cities, so they have high tops as well as lower bottoms, while the income profiles of smaller localities are typically more ‘compressed,’ " said Jamie Peck, a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia who has studied urban and political patterns in the United States. How old a city is can matter, too, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist and vice president of analytics at the real estate website Trulia. In older cities many middle-income residents have relocated to the suburbs, leaving behind higher levels of inequality. By contrast, newer cities -- such as Mesa (which is near Phoenix) or Arlington (which is near Dallas) -- often contain many suburban areas or are, in effect, suburbs themselves, Kolko said. Such cities tend to have more modest income ranges. Why does all this matter? It undercuts the notion that partisan leadership has much to do with why certain cities become relatively unequal and certain become relatively equal. Causation may actually run the opposite way. It’s always important to remember that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. In this context, it’s not necessarily that Republican leadership creates greater equality, as Paul’s comment presumes. Rather, it could be that greater equality prompts people to vote Republican. Or it could be unrelated. "I think it runs more in the direction that inequality provides conditions for Democratic success, rather than Democrats causing inequality," said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who specializes in electoral patterns and geography. And any explanation other than political leadership causing greater equality weakens Paul’s point. The pattern holds only if you look at cities, not metropolitan areas. If you look at Kolko’s research -- which studied inequality in broader metropolitan areas, rather than in cities per se -- Paul’s pattern falls apart. As of 2014, of the 10 metropolitan areas with the most equality, only one has a Republican mayor -- Colorado Springs. The other nine either have a Democratic mayor, a nonpartisan one, or no mayor at all because they’re an unincorporated area. This list includes Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla.; Allentown, Pa.; Salt Lake City; Bethesda-Rockville-Frederick, Md., Tacoma, Wash.; Las Vegas; Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.; Raleigh; and Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. What Paul’s office says Brian Darling, a former spokesman for Paul, told PolitiFact last year that the senator was not simply casting aspersions on Democratic mayors’ handling of their cities’ economies. "What he was saying is that Democrats are not solving the problem," Darling said. "It may be an unsolvable problem. Democrats love to talk about the issue and have been allowed to position themselves as the warriors for those harmed by income inequality, yet they are not a party of action" on this issue. That’s a reasonable point, but we think a typical listener hearing Paul’s comment would have assumed that he was arguing that Republican policies have promoted greater equality in cities than Democratic policies have. And as we’ve found, that’s far from clearcut. Our ruling Paul said that income inequality "seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats." He has a point that one credible study shows a fairly strong correlation between low inequality and a Republican mayor. But experts say it’s a stretch to draw conclusions from this. The claim inflates the actual powers of mayors to shape inequality in their cities and it ignores the role of population size and suburbanization in driving inequality. It also glosses over the fact that metropolitan areas, as opposed to cities, show no such relationship. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-00981	Mercury is used in vaccines, and there is no safe level of mercury.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/11/mike-adams/anti-vaccine-claim-rooted-fraud-confusion/	With a measles outbreak sprouting in 14 states, and Georgia reporting its first case in almost three years, vaccine opponents are reviving claims about the dangers of vaccines against the disease in newsfeeds across the country. An alert reader was skeptical of one Facebook post, reviving a 2012 story that purports to list "10 outrageous (but true) facts." It starts with the claim that helped spur the anti-vaccination movement, despite being repeatedly debunked: Childhood shots contain mercury, a powerful neurotoxin with no safe level of use. "Doctors who inject children with vaccines are delusional," Mike Adams concludes from his list of claims. "They are practicing a medical holocaust against humanity." How could PolitiFact Georgia resist jumping in to such subtlety? Adams declined to speak with us about his conclusions regarding mercury. He referred us instead to studies on his website, most of which deal with effects of methyl mercury. That is a very different chemical from ethyl mercury, a component in the vaccine preservative thimerosal. We’ll get to that difference in a minute. But the story of thimerosal and vaccine safety bears repeating. Early vaccinations carried the risk of dangerous and sometimes lethal bacterial infections, such as a staph infection that killed four children in 1916. Thimerosal was added to vaccines to keep multi-dose vials free from such bacteria starting in the 1930s. In 1998, the British medical journal the Lancet published a paper that claimed there was a link between the MMR vaccine — for measles, mumps and rubella — and autism. The paper by Dr. Andrew Wakefield drew considerable publicity and is credited in pushing vaccination rates down in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration held meetings to discuss the idea that thimerosal — then used in three childhood vaccines such as the hepatitis B shot — was damaging immunized infants’ brains and contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses. At the time, Dr. Neal Halsey was the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. The Johns Hopkins pediatrician had long pushed for expanding vaccinations as a way for children to live healthier lives. But he was willing to entertain the idea that thimerosal was helping to impair infant brains, even though there were no data to support the theory. Thimerosal was removed and has not been used as a preservative in any vaccine on the recommended schedule for children since 1999. By 2004, Wakefield's study was retracted and would later be deemed an "elaborate fraud" by the British medical journal BMJ. Wakefield eventually lost his medical license over the ordeal. At the same time, several studies, including ones in 2001 and 2004 from the Institute of Medicine, found no evidence linking vaccines and autism. "There was no convincing evidence that there was any harm from thimerosal, but I felt we would have difficulties with public acceptance of vaccines if we continued its use," Halsey said. "We are not using it anymore. Now the science is definitive that the small amount of thimerosal did not cause autism or any other neurological damage. " The damage may already have been done, though, regarding public suspicion of vaccines. Like Halsey, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, agreed that the science never supported the theory that thimerosal caused harm. But Offit worried attention to the unproven fear of "mercury" was minimizing the proven fear of the diseases the vaccines were designed to keep at bay. "Before there were vaccines, whooping cough killed 8,000 children a year, polio crippled 20,000 kids and killed 1,500 to 2,000," Offit said. "Measles killed 500 children a year and caused 48,000 to be hospitalized. The best way to address safety concerns is not to cater to false ones and focus on those real threats." Adams also confuses the issue with the interchangeable use of the term "mercury" for both thimerosal’s ethyl mercury and the more problematic methyl mercury. Think of ethyl mercury like ethyl alcohol — easily expelled from the human body but dangerous in large quantities. Thimerosal was used in trace amounts in vaccines. Methyl mercury is the compound found in fish and water, which builds up because the body can’t easily expel it. While some amounts occur naturally in the environment, it’s more comparable to methyl alcohol, the methanol that fills your gas tank but isn’t fit for human consumption. Repeated research studies agree that there is no evidence of harm from thimerosal’s mercury compound in vaccines. But there is an even bigger problem with Adams’ claim. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aware of the controversy and confusion, lists all ingredients in childhood vaccines for review. MMR, the vaccine making headlines now, never contained thimerosal. Neither did the shots for chickenpox, polio or others. Thimerosal, remember, was designed to prevent bacterial growth with repeated entry into a vial. Therefore, it wouldn’t be used in single-use vials most common in the United States. And there is no need for a preservative with the live virus vaccines such as measles, said Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review. In other words, our reader was right to be skeptical. There has been debate in the scientific community about removing a mercury compound from some vaccines. But the science has always been clear that there is no evidence that compound causes harm. Bluntly, vaccines help, not hurt. And if you still don’t believe that? Consider that the recipe in question — that is, the series of shots recommended for childhood immunization — does not include the ingredient singled out as the problem. Any claims to the contrary muddy what should be a simple issue. We rate the claim Pants On Fire.	None	Mike Adams	None	None	None	2015-02-11T00:00:00	2015-02-10	['None']
pomt-03266	Says federal regulations adopted in 2011 increased the cost of each vehicle for his business by $10,000.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/09/mike-collins/does-truck-claim-carry-its-weight-accuracy/	A congressional candidate says Uncle Sam is making it tougher to keep on truckin’. Mike Collins told the Gwinnett Daily Post that changes in federal emissions standards have added $10,000 to the price of every new truck his family’s trucking business buys. "The EPA is stifling business," Collins told us, referring to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which helped write those standards. PolitiFact Georgia was curious about his claim and hit the fact-checking trail for more details. Collins is running as a Republican for the U.S. House of Representatives in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, a conservative stretch of northeast Georgia. The current officeholder, Paul Broun, is running for the U.S. Senate. Broun’s successor will take office in January 2015. Collins is one of six candidates in the race. Collins’ father, Mac, served 12 years in the U.S. House, from 1993 to 2005, representing portions of several south metro Atlanta counties. The younger Collins is the vice president and financial officer of Collins Trucking, which boasts on its website that its vehicles can haul a minimum of 48,000 pounds of cargo. A heavy-duty truck can cost about $100,000. Collins said new federal emissions regulations that took effect in 2011 on heavy-duty trucks are responsible for some big changes in sales prices. In May 2010, President Barack Obama announced a plan to produce more environmentally friendly vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA created new guidelines for combination tractors that are used for freight transportation, heavy-duty pickup trucks, and gasoline and diesel heavy-duty engines. The goal: reduce carbon dioxide emissions by anywhere from 7 percent to 20 percent, along with reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The new regulations took effect in August 2011. The EPA outlined the environmental and cost benefits in one report: "The agencies estimate that the combined standards will reduce (carbon dioxide) emissions by about 270 million metric tons and save about 530 million barrels of oil over the life of vehicles built for the 2014 to 2018 model years, providing $49 billion in net program benefits. The reduced fuel use alone will enable $50 billion in fuel savings to accrue to vehicle owners, or $42 billion in net savings when considering technology costs. A second phase of regulations is planned for model years beyond 2018." So have these changes resulted in $10,000 price increases in the past two years? "That’s the number that’s been floating around," said Guy Young, vice president of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association, based in Marietta. There are no studies of the impact of emissions changes that took effect in 2011 on truck prices. An EPA spokeswoman said the $10,000 upfront cost is consistent with the EPA’s regulatory impact analysis for heavy-duty vehicles starting in model year 2014. "It should be noted, however, that the same analysis finds that using technologies commercially available today, the majority of vehicles will see a payback period of less than one year, while others, especially those with lower annual miles, will experience payback periods of up to two years," said the spokeswoman, Davina Marraccini. "For example, an operator of a tractor-trailer can pay for the technology upgrades in under a year and have net savings up to $73,000 over the truck’s useful life." Marraccini said the standards were developed with support from the trucking industry. The National Automobile Dealers Association and American Truck Dealers released a report in March 2012 on the impact of emissions requirements on vehicles with a model year from 2004 to 2010. It disputes the EPA’s cost-benefit projections. "EPA underestimated compliance costs by a factor of 2-5," the report said. "These higher-than-projected costs resulted in, among other things, significantly lower-than-projected new truck sales which necessarily reduced the environmental benefits associated with these standards." The report found the average surcharge on heavy-duty trucks made in 2010 that were compliant with the emissions guidelines was about $9,000 for nearly every manufacturer. For medium-duty trucks, the surcharge was generally between $6,000 and $7,300. Bill Iredale, who’s been in the truck sales business for nearly 40 years, said Collins was correct about the price increase. "Absolutely," said Iredale, sales manager at Ace Beverage Refurb & Sales, based in Norcross. Iredale said the price increases have resulted from a series of new federal emissions regulations over the past decade. Ten years ago, a medium-body truck cost about $50,000. Today, the price is about $75,000. Iredale said the recent emissions requirements do have a positive impact on air quality. "It’s a good thing," he said. "It really helped clean up the air." Young agreed that the vehicles have better fuel economy. "They’re really good fuel engines, but (manufacturers) had to make some changes to get that way," he said. So, is Collins right? The EPA anticipated such additional upfront costs. Not surprisingly, the EPA and trucking industry debate the cost benefit of the regulations. The anecdotal evidence we heard and the 2012 truck dealers report suggest Collins may be right about the higher costs. The statement, however, falls a bit shy of an absolute True ruling. It has to be viewed in the context of the overall fuel savings the new vehicles will accrue. That could be substantial and actually offset the higher costs in the long run. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Mike Collins	None	None	None	2013-08-09T00:00:00	2013-08-01	['None']
pomt-12409	The Department of Homeland Security’s database of legal immigrants has "never" been "bounced against a state’s voter rolls."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/may/23/kris-kobach/trumps-election-commission-chair-kris-kobach-says-/	Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who will help lead President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission, says the federal government has data on millions of legal noncitizens ineligible to vote, but it has never compared its rosters to state voter rolls. Kobach told Fox News he wants to change that as part of his role as vice chair of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, headed by Vice President Mike Pence. "The Department of Homeland Security knows of the millions of aliens who are in the United States legally and that’s data that's never been bounced against the state's voter rolls to see whether these people are registered," Kobach, a Republican, told Fox News May 14. Kobach later continued. "So, one thing that's never been done before, that I alluded to earlier, is the Department of Homeland Security has a database of all known aliens, green card holders, temporary visas holders in the United States. And that has never been bounced against a state’s voter rolls to say well, hey, how many of these people, with this name, this date of birth, so you can get an exact match. How many of them are registered to vote in state A or state B?" Kobach’s comments struck us as misleading, because of the widespread publicity about the problems Florida faced when attempting to use federal data to search for noncitizen voters. The only DHS data we know of that includes these legal immigrants is Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. SAVE has been used in a handful for states precisely for the purpose of weeding out ineligible voters. But when it was tried in Florida under Republican Gov. Rick Scott, it created so many problems that it was scrapped in 2012. Kobach didn’t refer to SAVE by name on Fox News, and his spokeswoman didn’t directly answer our question as to whether that was the data he was meant. But there’s no other database of legal immigrants that we know of that could be compared to voter rolls. Implemented in 1987, SAVE provides government officials access to various databases, usually so various agencies can verify the citizenship status of an individual to determine eligibility for benefits such as Medicaid or Social Security. (This is not a database of illegal immigrants, such a full list doesn’t exist.) SAVE has access to records on noncitizens who have been processed by federal agencies. For that reason, SAVE later became used by a few states for voter registration purposes. Which places use SAVE? Election officials in Florida, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia and several Arizona counties have reached agreements with DHS to use SAVE, but they aren’t necessarily active users. In fiscal year 2016, less than 1 percent of 20 million SAVE queries were for voter registration (or about 920). Florida’s 2012 attempt shows why a state might decide to change course. Florida election officials briefly used SAVE as part of a voter-purge effort. But doing so led to many errors, including wrongly identifying some citizens as noncitizens including four Polk County residents born in Puerto Rico, which automatically qualifies them for U.S. citizenship. Yeral Arroliga, an immigrant from Nicaragua, was flagged as a noncitizen despite telling the Miami Herald he provided proof of citizenship. State election officials ultimately scrapped using SAVE. State election officials in Georgia and Virginia also told PolitiFact that they no longer use the system. Colorado and North Carolina, however, still do. Federal warnings said SAVE isn’t foolproof The Homeland Security Department under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama has cautioned states about relying too much on the system for voter registration purposes. Some state election officials including Kobach’s spokeswoman, Samantha Poetter, has said SAVE isn’t useful for voter registration purposes because the federal government puts too many restrictions on its use. For state election officials to use SAVE, they need a person’s alien registration number or a naturalization certificate or certificate of citizenship -- information that election officials don’t typically have. "SAVE access has not been granted in a meaningful way to any state," Kobach’s spokeswoman Samantha Poetter said. "The state must already possess an alien number assigned by the federal government." While some states have said SAVE isn’t useful to them, others have found workarounds. Colorado and North Carolina election officials told PolitiFact that they obtain information from drivers license records. A driver’s license shows that applicants are not citizens and then check to see if they registered to vote. If they obtain a match, then they run the person through SAVE. A match isn’t definitive -- because the information may be out of date. That’s why even a match in SAVE requires additional steps to determine if someone is not a citizen and therefore ineligible to vote. North Carolina’s post-2016 election audit showed that 41 noncitizens with legal status, such as a green card, cast ballots. The audit identified an additional 34 voters who provided documents showing they are U.S. citizens, and investigators continue to review 61 additional records. That’s out of a total of nearly 4.8 million voters who participated in the November election. Virginia election officials found SAVE wasn’t useful because the state doesn’t have the alien numbers. However, Virginia uses another method: the names of those who check a box on a driver’s license form indicating they are not citizens is run against the voter registration list. If that produces a match, it is forwarded to a local registrar who sends letters to the voters. The current system works, Virginia's top elections official Edgardo Cortés said. "Overall the processes states have in place -- the checks we have in the system with all the data sharing going on -- we are able to identify folks who at some point are not supposed to be on the list and get them off," Cortés said. Our ruling Kobach says the Department of Homeland Security’s database of legal immigrants has "never" been "bounced against a state’s voter rolls." There is a kernel of truth here, in that there has not been a widespread comparison of federal government data on immigrants and voter rolls in all the states to search for noncitizen voters. However, Kobach misleads when he said that it has never been tried. A handful of states have used federal information about immigrants in SAVE to check voter eligibility. Some of them encountered issues with the system and have chosen not to keep using it. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05449	Says bus riders subsidize the "expensive, romanticized" Leander-to-Austin train.	false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/25/clay-dafoe/clay-dafoe-says-austin-bus-riders-subsidize-commut/	CLARIFICATION, 11:20 a.m. April 26, 2012: This fact check incorporates corrected 2010 and 2011 revenue figures provided by Capital Metro after the article’s publication. The changes do not affect our rating. As Austin’s candidates for mayor took part in a debate April 16, 2012, Clay Dafoe urged less spending on trains and more money for bus service. "Basically, what we’re having is people riding a bus, subsidizing this expensive, romanticized train that really doesn’t qualify or fit the needs of Austin," said Dafoe, a tax preparer, in the debate televised by Austin’s KXAN-TV, Channel 36. Although Austin is again considering a plan for electric-powered "urban rail," its current system is diesel-powered commuter trains, in operation since 2010. Capital Metro, Austin’s transit agency, runs MetroRail between Leander and downtown Austin roughly 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. weekdays and, with hours added in March, until midnight Friday and 4 p.m. to midnight Saturday. A one-way fare to ride the whole distance is $2.75. MetroBus is Capital Metro’s catch-all term for its 65 regularly scheduled bus routes criss-crossing Austin and in some cases extending out to suburbs like Leander, Manor and the Wells Branch area. A day pass, entitling a rider to board all but the agency’s 900 series express bus, costs $2; an express bus day pass costs $5.50. From data that Cap Metro spokeswoman Erica McKewen emailed to us, including a link to the agency’s 2012 budget, it’s clear MetroBus earns more than MetroRail. For 2012, Cap Metro predicted MetroRail will provide 400,000 rides and earn $909,939, while MetroBus will provide 25.4 million rides and earn $8.8 million in fares. But expenses are considerably higher than revenue from fares. MetroRail’s 2012 operating costs were estimated at $11.8 million for 2012, and MetroBus expenses at $106.6 million. So neither system is covering its own expenses -- nor is either intended to. Most of Cap Metro’s budget comes from a sales tax on purchases made in the agency’s service area, McKewen said. A chart on Cap Metro’s website shows the agency expects 80.3 percent of its 2012 revenues will come from that 1 percent tax, which its board raised from 0.75 percent in 1995. Thus, the tax is expected to bring in $153.2 million (out of $191 million total revenues) for 2012. Cap Metro’s 2011 year-end financial report says that in 2011, sales tax revenues were $151.2 million (80 percent of total $189.3 million), compared with $141.9 million (74 percent of total $191.9 million) in 2010, the year MetroRail began running. McKewen said that Cap Metro’s April 23, 2012, deal to outsource bus operations is not expected to result in the system becoming profitable. Are bus riders "subsidizing" the trains, in any sense? Not by the usual definition of "subsidy," which is a grant of money. McKewen said no block of funds is transferred from the bus services to the train services. If we use a more colloquial sense of "subsidize," we might say, for example, that if one unit of a company turns a profit while another loses money, the first unit is "paying" to keep the other afloat. That’s not the case here: Neither the rail nor buses turn a profit. Our ruling Cap Metro’s buses pull more of their weight, so to speak, than its trains. But neither system turns a profit, and besides, most of the agency’s budget comes from sales tax, not tickets to ride. So if anybody’s "subsidizing" the trains, it’s Austin-area shoppers, though that group likely overlaps with bus riders. We rate Dafoe’s statement False.

pomt-10862	"The crime decline in the United States would be fairly small if it wasn't for the crime decline in New York City."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/01/rudy-giuliani/sorry-new-york-is-not-that-big/	Here's the full quote, from Giuliani's May 31, 2007 speech to the Manhattan Institute: "But even as you look back on it, the crime decline in the United States would be fairly small if it wasn't for the crime decline in New York City." This is a case of taking good statistics and using them to reach a false conclusion. Giuliani rightfully boasts about significant drops in crime rates during his tenure as mayor. The raw percentages are eye-popping, but they also mirror a trend that could be seen nationally and in cities around the country. In this statement, Giuliani simply tries to say too much. His assertion that the national decline in crime "would be fairly small" if not for the improvements in New York just isn't true. From 1993-2001 -- the time frame the Giuliani campaign uses for its crime stats -- the number of violent crimes nationwide fell by about 25 percent. If you factor out the crimes that occurred in New York during that same period, the nationwide drop would still have been 23 percent. The difference in the decline for property crimes would have been even smaller.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-09-01T00:00:00	2007-05-31	['United_States', 'New_York_City']

pomt-09636	"I didn't campaign on a public option."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/23/barack-obama/public-option-obama-platform/	With a health care vote in the Senate approaching, President Barack Obama discussed reform and compromise in an interview with the Washington Post . The reporter asked Obama what his general thoughts were on compromise in the political process. Obama launched into a defense of the health care bill, an area where some of his liberal supporters have accused him of compromising too much. "Nowhere has there been a bigger gap in the perceptions of compromise and the reality of compromise than in the health care bill," Obama said. He then listed several things he called for during the campaign that he considers to be part of the bill, including coverage for the uninsured, new rules for insurance companies, tax breaks for small businesses and measures that rein in growing costs. "Every single criteria for reform that I put forward is in this bill," Obama said. "It is true that the Senate version does not have a public option, and that has become, I think, a source of ideological contention between the left and the right. But I didn't campaign on a public option. I think it is a good idea. But as I said in that speech on Sept. 9 (on health care), it is just one small element of a broader reform effort. And so we don't feel that the core elements to help the American people that I campaigned on and that we've been fighting for all year have been compromised in any significant way." We got an e-mail from a reader pointing out Obama's statement that he "did not campaign on a public option." How can that be, the reader asked, when the public option was clearly part of Obama's platform? We agree that the public option was part of Obama's platform. It's a promise we've listed in our database of Obama's campaign promises. It says that through a new health care exchange, "any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for people and families who need it." But, we also have to say that the public option was not a very prominent part of Obama's platform. We added the promise in August after the public option became an intense part of the debate. We were able to find the proposal pretty quickly after looking in Obama's campaign literature, but he didn't discuss it very much during the campaign. That's true for both the general election and the Democratic primary. If you look for mentions of the public option in Obama's speeches or comments to voters, you'll find very few. In fact, Obama gave a major address in Iowa on May 29, 2007, outlining his health care plan in considerable detail. There's not one mention of the public option in his speech. The Democratic primary's big health care battle was over whether there should be an individual mandate that required people to buy health insurance. Candidates Hillary Clinton and John Edwards said there should be a mandate; Obama was opposed. Obama said that people don't buy insurance because they can't afford it, not because they don't want to, and it was wrong to force them. When negotiations began on health care legislation in 2009, however, Obama changed his position and supported the mandate. (We gave him a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter .) So during the campaign, the public option was not mentioned much. But since we track campaign promises, we believe candidates should be held accountable for all their promises, and that includes things they have in their campaign literature. It's up to voters to decide whether the public option -- Promise No. 518 -- is more or less important than Obama's other promises. Obama's new claim is, "I didn't campaign on a public option." We will stipulate that it was not a particularly prominent part of his overall platform for health care. But we find that the public option was part of Obama's campaign materials, and that counts. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06433	"Our president has labeled Americans as soft."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-barack-obama-labeled-americans-sof/	Just before the Oct. 18, 2011, CNN Republican presidential debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry's campaign posted a video online powered by excerpts from a recent speech he gave unveiling his energy plan. In the video, Perry also levels a charge against President Barack Obama, saying: "The central issue facing Americans is a lack of jobs. There are 14 million Americans without work today. Our president has labeled Americans as soft. Well, I believe our people have toughed it out the best that they can, but they are looking for leadership and they are looking for optimism." We wondered if Obama had really labeled Americans as soft. To support Perry's statement, his presidential campaign pointed us to a Sept. 29 Wall Street Journal blog entry about an interview Obama gave that day to a news reporter from WESH-TV in Orlando. According to the Journal blog, Obama said in the interview that the U.S. has lost some of its competitive edge and had gotten a "little soft." That comment generated a lot of criticism, from conservative bloggers and politicians alike, who saw in Obama's comment criticism of the American public. On Oct. 1, two days after the Obama interview, Perry told Fox News that it's not Americans who are soft, but the president. "We've got some bad policies on tax and regulation in Washington, D.C., that are kicking people out of jobs every day," Perry said. "That's the real tragedy." We listened to the eight-minute interview of Obama by reporter Jim Payne. Obama's "soft" comment came about a minute into his response to Payne's question about whether the president shared his concern that younger Americans won't have as many opportunities as their parents did. "Oh, absolutely," Obama began. "And keep in mind that first of all, this is the worst financial crisis and recession that has existed in our lifetimes. I mean, you have to go back to the 1930s to see something like this, and so it's challenging for young people who are coming up in the midst of those kinds of circumstances." Obama continued: "But even before the financial crisis hit, one of the reasons that I ran for president was that wages, incomes had flat-lined at the same time that costs were going up. I think people felt that opportunities were becoming more constricted for the next generation. And that's why making sure that we're revamping our education system, making sure we've got world-class infrastructure, investing in basic science and research and technology, making sure that we are moving manufacturing back to the United States and that we're being tough with our trading partners, making sure that they're not taking advantage of us." And then: "There are a lot of things that we can do. And the way I think about it is, you know, this is, you know, a great, great country that had gotten a little soft, and, you know, we didn't have that same competitive edge that we needed over the last couple of decades. We need to get back on track. But, you know, I still wouldn't trade our position with any countries on Earth. We still have the best universities, the best scientists and best workers in the world. We still have the most dynamic economic system in the world, so we just need to bring all those things together." Reporters had different interpretations of Obama's comment, hinging primarily on timing. For example, a news article on the CBS News website described Obama as saying the United States "had gotten a little soft" before he took office. Other reports, including one by Fox News, interpreted Obama's comment as saying he thinks the country got soft and remains so. In an Oct. 3 briefing, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Obama's "soft" comment was part of his explanation of why he ran for president and "why we need to take every measure we can to ensure that America remains the strongest, most powerful country around the world." Carney also said that the comment pertained to political leaders in Washington and that previous administrations had not acted to ensure the economy was as robust as possible. Our sense is Perry took Obama's "soft" comment and amped it up for maximum effect. Saying the country had gotten soft in the past, as Obama did, is less immediate, personal and provocative than saying Americans are currently soft. Also, Perry's statement ignores that Obama also told the TV reporter that he "wouldn’t trade our position with any countries on Earth" and that American universities, scientists and workers are the best in the world.

pomt-12714	Says 70 percent of benefits in Donald Trump’s proposal for child care "go to the people making over $100,000 a year."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/08/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-donald-trumps-child-care-proposa/	House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she cannot jump on board with President Donald Trump’s child care proposals because they won’t actually help the poorest Americans. On CNN’s State of the Union, moderator Jake Tapper said, "In a speech to a joint session of Congress, President Trump renewed his commitment to child care and paid family leave ... Paid family leave, a big Democratic priority for a long time, is that something you could work with the president on?" Pelosi said, "The first conversation I had with him after the election, that week of the election, we talked about that subject, and a subject that his family is interested in as well. But what he has proposed is something that benefits -- 70 percent of the benefits go to people making over $100,000 a year." We decided to check out Pelosi’s claim. It’s important to note she is not referring to the estimated benefits of paid family leave, but the monetary benefits of Trump’s child care tax proposals. Trump has made no formal attempts to advance his paid family leave policy yet, although both Democratic and Republican senators introduced two different bills on this general issue. So all we have is an analysis of his proposal from the campaign. Trump’s proposal includes six weeks of paid maternity leave if no policy is offered by an employer; tax deductions for child care expenses up to age 13, capped at the average cost of childcare per state; a refundable tax credit for child care costs for lower-income families; and expanding tax-free savings accounts for childcare and school tuition. The Tax Policy Center, run by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, released its study of Trump’s child care plan Feb. 28, a few days before Pelosi’s interview. Pelosi’s spokesman confirmed she was citing this report on during her CNN interview. The Tax Policy Center study found that 70 percent of total tax benefits would go to families earning more than $100,000. The reason? Trump’s plan relies on tax deductions, which are worth more per dollar for higher income families. That’s because families with higher incomes face higher marginal tax rates. Lower-income families may spend less on child care because they often rely on informal, low-cost arrangements. Chye-Ching Huang, one of the study’s co-authors and deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email, "The estimate that 70 percent of the benefits go to those with incomes over $100,000 is conservative -- the share going to those with incomes over $100,000 could very well be higher." Analysts looked at three new tax benefits related to child care proposed by his campaign: the deduction for child care expenses, a refundable credit aimed at low-income families without stay-at-home parents, and the expansion of tax-free savings accounts. According to their report, Trump’s plan would increase the average after-tax income for families by about $190 in 2017. Those with an income below $40,000 per year might see an increase of $20 or less. Families making between $100,000-$200,000 per year might see an average jump of $360. Further, they say Trump’s proposed tax credit for lower-income families is worth less than the deduction. Taxpayers who claim the credit would benefit by up to 7.7 cents per dollar spent on child care. Those claiming the deduction may receive between 10 and 39.6 cents per dollar spent on child care. Lower income families are also less likely to place money into Trump’s proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity. In sum, then, the report finds that Trump’s current family leave policy is regressive, helping families in higher income brackets more than those in lower-income ones. Alan Cole, an economist from the Tax Foundation, said that he agreed with the distribution tables from the Tax Policy Center’s report. "The only caveat I'd add is that campaign proposals like this one tend to be refined and revamped after people take office," he said. "I could easily see the next version of the policy having a different distributional impact." The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Pelosi said that Trump’s plan for child care would mean that "70 percent of the benefits go to the people making $100,000 a year." The one comprehensive study released so far by an independent group supports Pelosi’s claim. It’s possible that different studies -- or a substantive change to the Trump administration proposal as it works its way toward enactment -- could weaken the certainty of Pelosi’s analysis. Based on what we know now, though, we rate her statement True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2017-03-08T11:41:50	2017-03-05	['None']

pomt-04362	Says a university survey concluded his Massachusetts administration "had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/22/mitt-romney/romney-says-survey-found-massachusetts-had-more-wo/	A day after the second presidential debate, "binders full of women" had hit full meme status, spawning Web games and Halloween costumes. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said that he used "binders full of women" from women’s groups to help staff his administration, resulting in a Cabinet and senior staff with "more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America." He cited a survey from the University at Albany-SUNY. Chatter quickly swirled over whether those "binders" — full of resumes, you Twitter fiends, as opposed to actual women — came at Romney’s request or were the result of a concerted effort by activists that predated his administration. We wondered about the result: Was Romney right that a survey concluded his Cabinet and senior staff "had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America"? What Romney said According to Romney at the debate, the study showed he was a leader in getting women on his top staff. "As I was serving as governor of my state ... I had the chance to pull together a Cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men. "I went to my staff, and I said, ‘How come all the people for these jobs are all men?’ They said, ‘Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.’ And I said, ‘Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?’ "So we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks,’ and they brought us whole binders full of women. "I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America." The Albany report Romney took office in January 2003. The report he cited, published in 2004, focused on a snapshot of policy leaders by gender in 2003. And indeed, it ranked Massachusetts No. 1 in the nation, up from No. 5 in the previous surveys in 1999 and 2001. Of 20 top policy leaders in the state, half were women, according to self-reported statistics from the administration. The report ranked states by a "representativeness ratio" — how closely the proportion of women in appointed leadership positions matched the proportion of women in the state. We talked with Judith Saidel, the researcher who directed the University at Albany project, which tracked appointees in state government. She found the wording of Romney’s claim in the debate "not entirely precise." Romney said the state "had more women," but it more accurately had the highest percentage of women in senior leadership positions tracked by the study. Twenty-one states appointed more women to top positions, she said. "If Gov. Romney had said that Massachusetts ranked No. 1 among the states … he would have been completely precise and accurate," she said. Still, she told the New York Times, "his record, as we measured it, looks darned good." What happened next We don't know if Massachusetts remained at the top for percentage of women in the administration. Because of a loss of grant funding, the survey was not conducted again, so there’s no snapshot of Romney’s appointments compared with other states for the rest of his term. But a group of women in Massachusetts who got Romney and his Democratic opponent for governor to agree to make appointing women a priority collaborated with a Boston university to track his progress. The work by researchers and MassGAP, the Massachusetts Government Appointments Project, isn’t comparative with the rest of the country — but does take Romney’s entire term into account. Rather than 20 senior leadership positions, it tracked 135 executive-level positions in the state. And like the Albany study, it found admirable parity in Romney’s first round of appointments: 42 percent of his first 33 hires to senior-level positions were women. "He does deserve credit for that first wave of appointments," said Carol Hardy-Fanta, senior scholar for the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at University of Massachusetts at Boston who co-authored the report. But the durability of Romney’s early effort was fleeting. From 2004 to 2006, two years removed from the spotlight of the campaign, just a quarter of Romney’s appointments were women. Upshot: By the time Romney left office, the percentage of women in those 135 positions was slightly lower than when he arrived, falling from 30 percent to just under 28 percent. "Though he can justifiably take pride that 42 percent of his initial appointments were women, he didn't really move the needle," Hardy-Fanta said. The Romney campaign pointed us to comments in the Washington Post from Elizabeth Levine, who chaired the Massachusetts Women’s Political Caucus when Romney was elected. She "said this type of fluctuation is the norm," the Post reported, because "administrations often appoint internal candidates to fill short-term positions near the end of a term and that women have a natural disadvantage in those situations." "If you don’t have a lot of new people in the pipeline, it’s harder to fill those positions with women," she told the Post. Hardy-Fanta, who was part of the original MassGAP initiative as co-chair of its team recommending women for appointments in higher education, said the group expected better. "I think there was an expectation that once you said this was important — and this group kind of made them aware that this was important — that it wouldn't disappear," she said. Our ruling Romney said a survey by the University at Albany after he staffed his Cabinet and senior staff concluded his Massachusetts administration "had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America." Twenty-one states actually employed more women in senior roles in 2003. Rather, Massachusetts had the best percentage in the country, something that earned the state positive recognition. But that’s a small clarification. Meanwhile, that narrow Albany survey reflected the number of female appointees shortly after Romney took office. A broader study that looked at all of Romney’s appointments and the percentage of women before and after his term found that his effort flagged halfway through his administration — and that the overall percentage of women in executive positions actually dropped.

pomt-14218	Richmond teachers have not gotten a raise "for almost 10 years."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/18/jack-berry/jack-berry-error-about-richmond-teacher-raises/	Jack Berry, one of a dozen candidates seeking to become Richmond’s next mayor, says the city has been neglecting its schools and educators. "There’s no excuse for buildings falling apart and teachers not getting a raise for almost 10 years," he said at an April 6 candidates forum organized by former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who was Richmond’s mayor from 2005 to 2009. We wondered if Berry was correct that the city’s teachers went a decade without a pay hike. Berry, the outgoing director of Venture Richmond, told us he based his statement on several articles about teacher pay in RVANews and Richmond Magazine. The articles note that teachers used to get milestone raises based on the number of years they worked in the school system. But it’s been 10 years since the Richmond School Board provided teachers a salary bump based on tenure, according to a chart sent to us by Charlotte Hayer, president of the Richmond Education Association, which represents many of the city’s teachers. During the Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009, that salary scale was frozen. "We haven’t moved (on the pay scale)," Hayer said. "We haven’t gained anything for our experience." That doesn’t mean there have been no raises at all for Richmond teachers during the past decade. They received five cost-of-living increases, based on information we got from the school system and the Richmond Education Association during the following fiscal years, which run from July 1 to June 30: •2014-15, 3 percent •2013-14, 2 percent •2008-09, 4 percent •2007-08, 4 percent •2006-07, 2 percent Ralph Westbay, the Richmond school system’s assistant director of financial services, said the cost-of-living pay increases were funded using a mix of city and state funds and were provided to all district teachers regardless of performance. This school year, teachers are getting an additional 1.5 percent in pay, but that’s because they have to work an extra three days, so Westbay said he wouldn’t characterize it as a raise. It also should be noted that teachers got a 1 percent bonus in 2012 but, because that was a one-time payment, it doesn’t count as a raise. We don’t suggest Richmond teachers are living in luxury. In 2013, they had to take five unpaid furlough days, which cut into their pay that year. And, there have been five years in the past 10 in which they received no raises at all: this school year and during the post-recession era from 2010 to 2013. When we called Berry and told him about our findings, he said his remarks at the candidates’ forum referred to the lack of tenure-based raises - not cost-of-living increases. We didn’t find the elaboration in a tape of the forum nor in a Berry campaign flier that says, "It is inexcusable for teachers to be denied a pay raise for almost 10 years, and for buildings to be falling apart." In case you’re wondering, teachers in Chesterfield, Henrico and Hanover counties generally saw the same pay hike pattern as Richmond during the past 10 years. Educators in those three counties got pay hikes until 2009 and then generally saw little or no raises from 2010 through 2013, but they have gotten raises in recent years. Our ruling Berry said Richmond teachers have not gotten a raise "for almost 10 years." Berry told us he was referring to the lack of tenure raises for teachers when they reach certain years of service. Such raises haven’t been offered for a decade. But he didn’t make that distinction at the candidates’ forum or in his campaign literature. His statement makes it sound as if teachers haven’t gotten any pay increase at all. That runs counter to figures from the school system and the Richmond Education Association that show they’ve gotten five cost-of-living increases during the past 10 years. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Jack Berry	None	None	None	2016-04-18T12:00:00	2016-04-06	['None']

pomt-15158	"By the end of this budget I'm in right now, taxes will have been cut $4.7 billion in my state."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-touts-47-billion-tax-cuts-he-right/	Live from somewhere in Iowa, Gov. Scott Walker stepped off the campaign stump for a phone interview with Glenn Beck, a nationally syndicated conservative radio talk show host. While rattling off a series of reforms since he became governor in 2010, Walker circled back to one of his favorite talking points: tax cuts. "By the end of this budget I’m in right now, taxes will have been cut $4.7 billion in my state," Walker said in the Aug. 17, 2015 interview. Last year, we checked a claim from Walker that tax cuts for his first term tallied $2 billion. We rated that True, based on numbers from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which is considered the gold standard on state fiscal matters. Now that some time has passed, and the boasted-about number is $2.7 billion larger, we thought we’d do some updated bean counting. $4.7 billion We recently dealt with the tax-cut picture under Walker in rating one of his 2014 campaign promises -- return any surplus to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts -- as In the Works. The item noted that a fiscal bureau estimate said that between 2015 and 2017, the impact of cuts by Walker and Republican lawmakers to sales, franchise, property and other taxes are expected to total $2.8 billion. That period represents the current two-year budget. The vast majority of that total comes from the continuing impact of cuts from Walker’s first term, such as a 2011 manufacturing and industry tax cut, and a 2013 income and property tax cut. New cuts in the 2015-’17 budget are projected to reduce taxes by $213 million by 2017, according to the fiscal bureau. Of course, the numbers are projections. So the total once the current two-year budget ends June 30, 2017 may vary. When Walker number-dropped the $4.7 billion, he was mentioning reforms that have taken place since he took office, such as defunding Planned Parenthood (which he did in his first budget) and passing Act 10 (which he did in 2011). So it’s clear he wasn’t talking just about the current budget. Adding Walker’s first term cuts to the ones in the current budget, tax cuts are projected at more than $4.7 billion. To be exact: $4,756,630,000. That gives Walker about $56 million in wiggle room. Jon Peacock, the director of Wisconsin Budget Project and research director at the left-leaning Wisconsin Council of Children and Families, said the numbers Walker was relying on were solid. But he noted the numbers did not include several changes that resulted in increases, such as a reduction in the earned income tax credit and the homestead credit. Peacock estimates between 2011 and 2016, those increases will exceed $250 million. Factor that in, and total tax cuts would be projected at about $4.5 billion. On the other hand, Walker’s numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so the $4.7 billion in tax cuts would be even more if it were adjusted. A final note: To be sure, tax cuts are just one part of the picture. To attain them, Walker’s budgets have also included numerous -- and controversial -- cuts to education and other areas. But the claim is on the size of the tax cuts, and that is what we are evaluating. Our rating In an interview with Glenn Beck, Walker said "by the end of this budget I'm in right now, taxes will have been cut $4.7 billion in my state." That figure holds up, based on numbers from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. We rate his claim True	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-08-28T10:00:00	2015-08-17	['None']
pomt-04471	The federal tax code has "loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/08/barack-obama/obama-says-tax-code-rewards-firms-shifting-jobs-ov/	President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have sparred over tax policy for many months. They have argued over the treatment of the middle class, small businesses and whether the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for the wealthiest 2 percent. The first presidential debate sparked debate on a different point -- the taxes paid by companies doing business overseas. So far, this topic has not played a prominent role in the campaign, although American-based multinational firms have a huge stake in the outcome. By one conservative estimate, this part of the tax code is worth $30 billion a year. During the debate, Obama tried to score points on Romney by highlighting the tax breaks companies get when they move jobs overseas. "When it comes to our tax code, Gov. Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States." Romney responded, "The idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case." In this fact-check, we'll examine the president’s statement and ask if there are tax incentives for companies that set up foreign operations. In the narrowest sense possible, Romney’s rebuttal is accurate. There is no clause in the tax code that rewards a company when it relocates production beyond U.S. borders. But if a plant moves at all, whether it’s from Ohio to Tennessee or Ohio to Malaysia, it is eligible for deductions. "There is certainly a tax break for U.S. companies that move operations or people abroad," said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. "It is simply a business expense like any other legitimate expense." Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, went even further. "A company would be arguably negligent if they did not claim the deductions," Harvey said. "In addition, the current tax law would allow a tax deduction for the costs of shutting down a U.S. operation." But both tax experts said the moving expenses were trivial compared to the hefty tax savings that companies can realize after they move their operations. There are two provisions in the code that allow them to shelter income from the IRS. Tax break #1: Keeping profits overseas When an American firm opens a foreign division, it typically sets up a separate company that does not pay U.S. taxes. "That foreign subsidiary is a new entity, organized and created in a foreign country, "said McGill. "And responsible for its own taxes." Profits earned by the subsidiary need not show up on the parent company’s tax return. The subsidiary pays taxes in the country where it's located. Those rates are often lower than in the U.S., where the corporate rate is 35 percent. So long as profits remain overseas, U.S. taxes are deferred. The company can declare that none of that money will return to the U.S. McGill, along with colleagues Edmund Outslay and Michael Donohoe, picked apart the public financial statements of Apple and other high-tech companies such as Google and IBM. With Apple, they found the company had built up $23.4 billion in earnings the company said would stay overseas permanently. And for good reason: Apple was paying an effective tax rate overseas of 1.2 percent on those profits. Tax break #2: Selling to yourself An American firm with a global network of subsidiaries has another way to trim its tax bill. All of those companies can buy and sell among themselves. It’s perfectly legal and very lucrative. Take the example of Google. In just one quarter, the owner of the world’s most popular search engine had nearly $2.8 billion in net income and over half of that came from outside the U.S. That would put Google in good shape regardless, but the foreign earnings would be especially valuable. In 2009, the company’s foreign tax rate was 2.4 percent, reported Bloomberg News. Google helped keep its taxes low by licensing its algorithms and other digital wizardry to an Irish subsidiary which then sold advertising around the world. The Irish tax rate on that income was 4 percent. But Google was able to drive its tax bill even lower by creating Google Ireland Holdings based in Bermuda where the tax rate is 0.6 percent. The Irish subsidiary sheltered its income by paying royalties to the subsidiary based in Bermuda. These transactions are supposed to cost the same as if they were conducted at arm’s length. Harvey, the former Pricewaterhouse Coopers partner, said they are anything but. "It is relatively clear most U.S. multinational corporations are aggressively shifting taxable income to low-tax jurisdictions," Harvey said. "I believe that anyone who believes the IRS can effectively enforce the arm’s-length standard is an eternal optimist — or delusional." Tallying the cost Harvey said the tax tools that multinationals can use give them a competitive advantage over domestic firms. He points to the work of Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit news service. Sullivan told the House Ways and Means Committee that the tax revenues lost through deferral and transfer pricing were worth between $30 billion to $60 billion a year. Sullivan also noted that American firms with international operations had shed American jobs while increasing their overseas employment. "Between 1999 and 2008, U.S. multinational corporations cut their domestic employment by 1.9 million. Over the same period U.S. multinationals increased their employment overseas by 2.4 million," Sullivan said. But the picture is more complicated than that might seem. There is strong debate over the role that tax rates play in those job shifts. Some analysts, including Harvey, believe the real drivers could be lower wage rates and being closer to important markets around the globe. However, regardless of the initial motivation, once companies make the move, in Sullivan’s words, "a toehold of real investment allows a truckload of profit to follow." Our ruling President Obama said there are "loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas." Independent analysts agree that firms with international operations can take advantage of tax loopholes that domestic firms can not. The value of these is in the billions. Such tax laws might not be the deciding factor for companies to locate in foreign countries, but they make that choice more lucrative. We rate the statement True.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., touted a number of things his home state can be proud of. "I'm from a little state, most patriotic state in the nation," Manchin told the crowd. "More veterans per capita, fought in more wars, shed more blood, lost more lives ... than any state. On top of that we've done all the heavy lifting. We mined the coal that made the steel that built the guns and ships, built the factories, built the middle class that gave you the quality of life you have today." Was he right that West Virginia has "more veterans per capita" than any state? Manchin’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we turned to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. We found a chart ranking the states based on the number of veterans as a percentage of the state’s civilian population age 18 and older. In this chart, West Virginia ranked 14th in the nation. However, the most recent data in this chart was from 2013, so we decided to look at any more recent data we could find. In 2016, there were 145,171 veterans in West Virginia, according to Census Bureau data. That’s just under 8 percent of the state’s estimated population of 1,815,857. (For this calculation, we used total population rather than just civilians over 18.) West Virginia’s percentage was higher than the national percentage -- nationwide, veterans made up 5.7 percent of the population in 2016 -- but it ranked below a number of other states. In fact, West Virginia doesn’t even make the top five: • Alaska: 9.2 percent • Maine: 8.5 percent • Montana: 8.4 percent • Virginia: 8.2 percent • Wyoming: 8.1 percent Our ruling Manchin said that West Virginia has "more veterans per capita" than any state. Compared to the nation as a whole, West Virginia’s percentage of veterans is higher than average. But it’s not first on the list — in fact, it’s not even in the top five. We rate the statement False.

pomt-03895	Under Gov. Scott Walker’s public-school budgets, "a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in his or her education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/03/sondy-pope/rep-sondy-pope-says-increases-education-funding-wo/	Democrats in the state Legislature were unimpressed when Gov. Scott Walker announced that his second budget would modestly boost school aids he cut substantially in his first. "At this pace, it will take nearly 12 years to return to the funding commitment the state made before Walker’s devastating cuts," state Rep. Sondy Pope, D-Cross Plains, said in a news release with state Sen. John Lehman, D-Racine. She made the same point in media interviews. Pope, the ranking Democrat on the Assembly’s Education Committee and a state lawmaker since 2002, put it in terms a parent of a school-age child might appreciate: "That means a student entering kindergarten will not enjoy the same state investment in his or her education as those that came before them until they are graduating from high school," her release said. The proposed increase is not enough for schools to make ends meet, Pope told reporters as details were leaked in advance of Walker’s 2013-’15 budget proposal. We won’t judge the impact of Walker’s moves here, but we were interested in whether Pope correctly described the math when talking about how long it would take to restore the aid cuts Walker made in the 2011-’13 budget cycle. Let’s take a look. State aid is the biggest source of funds for public school districts, which also rely on local property taxes. Pope refers to "equalized" aids, the most common form of general state school aids. They are calculated through a formula designed to minimize the differences among school districts’ abilities to raise revenue. Some districts have more property tax wealth than others, as the Legislative Fiscal Bureau puts it. Hence the term "equalized." Schools have seen significantly less equalized aid in recent years, even before Walker. His predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, cut equalized aid in his final budget, for 2009-’11, setting it back to a level not seen since 2005-’06. So Walker cut from an already diminished base. Pope’s office showed us their math behind the "nearly 12 years" comment. It’s based on comparing what Walker’s first budget allocated to the last two-year budget under Jim Doyle. The difference is $944 million. Now Walker wants to add back about $129 million in equalized aid over two years. At that pace, it would appear it’s going to be at least 12 years to fill the hole. But that’s not quite how Madison budget math works. We asked two budget experts to look at this. David Loppnow at the Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s nonpartisan scorekeeper, calculated that it would be about nine years at that pace to get back to the pre-Walker aid levels. Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, pegged it at between eight and nine years. Part of the difference, we found, was that Pope spoke before Walker had released details of how he would structure the $129 million boost. Pope’s office made assumptions on how the money would be divided up between the two years, and was off in its guess. The timing affects the calculation because the figure in year two of the budget is the base upon which the next year’s increase builds on. Loppnow said it was understandable, for that reason, that Pope came up with a different number. But the biggest reason for the numbers gap, we found, was that Pope’s method doesn’t account for Walker having added back some funds in year two of his first budget, somewhat alleviating the big aid cut in his first year. And that information was available before Walker released details. Our rating Pope said it would take Walker "nearly 12 years" to make up for his previous cuts in general school aids, based on the pace he set in his proposed 2013-’15 budget. The best number is about eight or nine years, we heard from two experts. That’s when, as Pope put it, a student will "enjoy the same state investment in his or her education" as a student in pre-Walker days. So it’s more like middle school or freshman year of high school, not graduation. We rate her claim False.	None	Sondy Pope	None	None	None	2013-03-03T09:00:00	2013-02-18	['None']

"Three years ago, a newly elected President Obama told America that if Congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent," Romney said in his speech in Las Vegas on Feb. 4, 2012. It’s a common claim by critics of the stimulus bill, the two-year spending package Obama championed to get the economy going again. We heard similar statements from House Republican Whip Eric Cantor in 2009, conservative columnist George Will in 2010, former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann in early 2011 and, most recently, from House Speaker John Boehner at the end of 2011. Each time, we rated the claim Mostly False. Projection vs. promise First, we have never found an instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge to keep unemployment below 8 percent. The source for Romney’s and the others’ statements is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." Our ruling Romney didn't use the word "promise" as Boehner, Cantor and others did when we checked the same claim previously, but the meaning is the same, that Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. Once again, we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-08237	Federal spending is "the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years (and) revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/15/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-says-federal-spendings-share-gdp-60-ye/	With the rise of the fiscally conservative tea party and the recent release of a draft report by the presidentially appointed National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the nation's fiscal challenges have rocketed up the list of urgent agenda items in Washington. We'll take a look at two comments on federal spending made on the Nov. 14, 2010, Sunday talk shows -- one by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and the other by Sen.-elect Rand Paul, R-Ky. We'll address Conrad's here. In an interview on ABC's This Week With Christiane Amanpour, Conrad -- who chairs the Senate Budget Committee and serves on the presidentially appointed panel -- said, "If you look at our spending, it's the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, so we're going to have to work both sides of the equation." Let's take a look at Conrad's numbers. As we did with Paul's item, we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole. In 2009, the last full year available, federal spending accounted for 24.7 percent of GDP. That's higher than it's been in any year since 1949 -- 60 years prior. You have to go back to 1946 to find a higher percentage -- 24.8 -- and that was a year in which the nation was winding down high rates of spending for World War II. (From 1943 to 1945, the height of the war, federal spending ranged from 41 percent to 43 percent of GDP.) Clearly, recessions have an impact on how high this percentage gets. The only other years since 1946 in which federal spending exceeded 23 percent of GDP came in 1982 and 1983, with 23.1 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively. That was during and immediately after the 1981-82 recession -- the last one that rivaled today's in severity. Economic downturns tend to affect this statistic because they slow GDP growth and increase the demand for government services. Even without special stimulus measures, spending goes up for mandatory items such as food stamps. Either way, Conrad is correct on spending. What about tax revenue as a percentage of GDP? In 2009, tax receipts accounted for 14.8 percent of GDP. According to the table, tax receipts as a share of GDP were always higher all the way back through 1950, when they accounted for 14.4 percent of GDP. That would be 59 years -- not quite 60, but very, very close. The recession factors into the tax revenue statistic as well. Both the 2008 stimulus package under President George W. Bush and the 2009 stimulus under President Barack Obama included tax breaks as a major component. Because the statistics show a number so close to 60 years -- and because Conrad was speaking during a television interview rather than a prepared speech or written statement -- we'll give him some leeway and rate the statement True.

pomt-07171	Commercial buses in the United States have "a stellar safety record, a safety record that exceeds that of any other commercial mode or surface transportation mode."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/11/peter-pantuso/bus-association-head-says-buses-safest-mode-commer/	A May 31 bus crash north of Richmond that left four dead and more than 50 injured has prompted a re-examination of bus safety. The bus was traveling from North Carolina to New York City’s Chinatown district when it swerved off I-95, struck an embankment and flipped over in Caroline County. Driver Kin Yiu Cheung faces charges of involuntary manslaughter. Virginia State Police say driver fatigue contributed to the crash. Peter Pantuso, president and CEO of the American Bus Association, a lobbying group, said the tragedy should not overshadow an excellent safety record by the U.S. bus industry. Buses travel the country "with a stellar safety record, a safety record that exceeds that of any other commercial mode or surface transportation mode," he said at a June 7 press conference in Richmond. Pantuso made two claims about safety: 1) That buses are safer than any other commercial mode, and; 2) That buses are the safest surface transportation mode. We checked out both. The Department of Transportation keeps safety statistics, but you have to go to a lot of offices to collect them. Different data -- often hard to compare -- is kept by the various agencies that oversee planes, trains and automobiles. We started by looking at highway safety. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 33,808 people were killed in automobile accidents during 2009, the latest year statistics are available. Of those people, 26 were bus passengers -- less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the total fatalities. In 2008, according to the NHTSA, 37,423 people died in U.S. vehicle accidents. That year, 67 of those killed, or about two-tenths of one percent, were bus passengers. Data going back to 2005 show bus passengers accounted for a similar percentage of vehicle deaths in other years. Airlines are safer than buses. In 2010, there were no fatalities in commercial U.S. airline travel. During the past decade, there has not been a single year when more than 100 people were killed in airline crashes, with the exception of 2001. That year airline deaths were high because of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Though fatalities are very low among airlines, there are several hundred air-travel deaths each year, primarily when private or chartered planes crash. All of these raw statistics, though, don’t give us a good "apples-to-apples" comparison of the safety of different transportation modes. So we turned to the National Safety Council, which focuses on improving workplace and transportation safety. Each year, the NSC produces a book of injury facts. The book’s transportation section determines how many deaths occur per passenger mile. Here’s how the statistic is calculated: If four friends leave Richmond and drive 100 miles to Norfolk, that’s 400 passenger miles. The return trip is another 400 passenger miles. The same principle applies to air or train travel. The NSC, using Department of Transportation data on fatalities and miles traveled, computes fatality rates for travel by plane, bus, train and automobile, The agency’s 2011 report contains average fatality rates for 2006 through 2008. Each rate is per 100 million passenger miles: * Scheduled airlines: 0.003 * Commercial buses: 0.05 * Passenger trains: 0.06 * Automobiles, including taxis: 0.61 Similar results emerge if you look at a 10-year average, from 1998 through 2007. Airlines have the lowest fatality rate, at 0.01 deaths per 100 million passenger miles. Buses and trains both have a rate of 0.04 deaths, and automobiles have a rate of 0.75 deaths. Statistics show that private auto fatalities have declined over the past 15 years, even as the number of drivers and amount of miles traveled has increased. The number of bus deaths has remained roughly constant, though far below the fatality rate for private auto travel. Let’s review our findings. Pantuso, the industry lobbyist, said buses have "a safety record that exceeds that of any other commercial mode or surface transportation mode." According to a wealth of transportation data, buses have been the safest mode of surface transportation in recent years, narrowly edging trains when fatalities are measured per 100 million miles. Passengers are far less likely to die in a bus crash than a car crash. So buses have a strong claim as the safest mode of surface transportation. But when it comes to moving passengers safely, nothing tops commercial air travel. The death rate of airlines is much lower than that of commercial buses. Pantuso was right about buses being the safest form of surface transportation, but wrong about them being the safest form of all commercial transportation. We’ll split the difference and rate his claim Half True.	None	Peter Pantuso	None	None	None	2011-06-11T07:00:00	2011-06-07	['United_States']
pomt-09165	"Rick Perry attempted to fast-track unnecessary coal-fired power plants, which degrade air quality and would cost billions. Fortunately, a court stopped him."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/07/bill-white/white-says-perry-fast-tracked-unncessary-coal-fire/	Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor, recently blasted his opponent's environmental record, saying in a May 17 press release: "Rick Perry attempted to fast-track unnecessary coal-fired power plants, which degrade air quality and would cost billions. Fortunately, a court stopped him." We wondered if White's salvo is on target. Some history: Perry issued his so-called fast-tracking order Oct. 27, 2005, "to encourage diversity of energy supply." The order told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which is responsible for judging requests for permits to pollute the air, to "prioritize and expedite the processing of environmental permit applications that are protective of the public health and environment and propose to use Texas' natural resources to generate electrical power." The order, issued as natural gas prices climbed and after Hurricane Katrina disrupted natural gas production, shortened administrative hearings on permits, which normally took about a year, to six months. At the time, Perry said he was hoping to spare electricity consumers from rate shocks due to the surging price of natural gas. A few months later, TXU Corp., a Dallas-based energy company, announced plans to double its power production by building eight coal-fired units. Company executives were joined by Perry at their April 2006 press conference, according to the Dallas Morning News. The company, which had submitted a permit application for two new coal-units in July 2005 and had plans to build another unit permitted by the state in 2003, said it would cost $10 billion to complete all 11 units. TXU also promised to cut emissions of pollutants including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and mercury by 20 percent, saying it would spend $500 million on equipment to control pollution at three of its existing coal-fired units in Texas. In a Sept. 8, 2006, press release, Perry defended his order and TXU's proposal, saying "the TXU plants are important to diversifying our energy supply so Texans do not face rate shock every time natural gas prices spike up." TXU was then the state's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, one of several greenhouse gases widely thought to be fueling global warming. The utility acknowledged the proposed plants would emit 78 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, in addition to the 55 million tons per year company plants were already emitting, according to the Morning News. Where was White as Perry aligned with TXU? As Houston's mayor, White opposed the eight proposed units as a member of the Texas Cities for Clean Air Coalition, which was formed by then-Dallas Mayor Laura Miller in August 2006 to challenge coal-fired power plant pollution. In September 2006, the Houston Chronicle quoted White saying: "We need to make sure that power plants built for today have minimal emissions and contributions to global warming, the greenhouse gases, where we will see increasing regulation in this country, and in other countries, in the future." TXU and anti-coal groups faced off for and against the proposed plants, while four groups consisting of people living near proposed plant sites sued Perry, calling his executive order unconstitutional. And in February 2007, a state district judge blocked it, saying Perry overstepped his constitutional authority in "directing a hearing officer to hold a hearing and reach a decision by a particular deadline." The judge issued an injunction that restored power to administrative law judges to delay a hearing on TXU's permit application. The judges then postponed the hearing until June of that year. Next came a big twist. In the following months, TXU was bought out by private owners, who quickly withdrew requests for permits to build eight of the 11 coal-fired units. In June 2007, the commission granted a permit for the two surviving units, going against an administrative judge's recommendation that the agency reconsider its approval after TXU failed to prove that technology to be used at the plant would effectively control emissions. Of late, Texas utilities — not including Luminant (formerly TXU) — are seeking permits for five more proposed coal-fired and petroleum coke-fired plants. So, Perry issued his speed-up order, which was canceled by a judge, as White says. Also as he says, the 11 coal-fired power units that TXU wanted to construct were expected to cost billions. Finally, let's circle back to White's contention that the plants were unnecessary. That's debatable. In 2006, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the power grid that serves most of Texas, forecast that the state needed fuel diversity to offset its dependence on natural gas, and new sources of energy to keep up with electricity demand — a tenet of Perry's 2005 order. However, anti-coal opponents who led the lawsuit against Perry's order argue that even if the state needed to generate more electricity, it should have come from cleaner energy sources such as wind power. Nathan Melson, president of Citizens Organizing for Resources and Environment, a nonprofit that organized in 2006 against TXU's proposed coal-fired plant in Savoy (about 70 miles north of Dallas), and one of the groups that sued Perry said: "We've all got to have electricity and we all have to live, but we ought to be looking at other technology out there." Another indicator: Whether electricity demand would have been met without the requested plants. Generally, ERCOT says, a reserve margin of at least 12.5 percent above the state's peak electricity demand is necessary to spare Texas customers frequent power outages. Theresa Gage, an ERCOT representative, told us she didn't know of any instance when ERCOT has operated below the reserve margin. "However, in 2006, projections showed that by 2009, with no new generation brought online... ERCOT would drop below the 12.5 percent margin," she said. "The 11 TXU plants — the three that were built and the eight that were not — would all have contributed to pushing the reserve margin to and above 12.5 percent." In the meantime, other power sources have filled the gap. Some 127 units have come online since 2006, adding 14,494 megawatts of power to the state's grid. About half of the added capacity is coming from wind energy, which generates 7,318 megawatts of power, trailed by gas (4,251 megawatts) and coal (2,913 megawatts). "We're where we need to be," Gage said. And On White's campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon said that because Texas has generation capacity greatly exceeding ERCOT's recommended reserve margin, the state never needed the eight plants contemplated by TXU. In contrast, Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, said that "construction of some of those (TXU-sought) plants is precisely why we're not looking at power shortages today." The three TXU coal-fired units that ended up getting built provide a combined 2,141 megawatts of power, according to ERCOT. "If you remove them from the calculation, then we are below the 12.5 percent margin starting in 2013, and below the 10 percent margin by 2015," Frazier said, citing ERCOT's projections. Unsaid: One of those units Frazier referenced had a permit two years before Perry issued his order and TXU had already applied for permits for the other two. His order didn't affect the first plant, but the other two stood to benefit from the expedited process, according to the TCEQ. Where does all this leave White's statement? Perry tried to speed up the environmental-permitting process for utilities and his order was later blocked by a court. Also, those plants would have cost billions. Whether the plants were unnecessary, as White puts it, depends on whose argument rings your bell. White is right in that plants fueled by other sources helped satisfy the state's electricity needs. Yet he's wrong if the few coal-fired plants that were completed helped Texas avoid a demand crisis. We're calling it a draw. The standoff on the question of necessity leaves White's statement Mostly True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-06-07T18:15:58	2010-05-17	['None']

pomt-11759	"Tennessee GOP twitter taken down after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/05/puppetstringnewscom/fake-russian-twitter-account-center-fake-tweet-abo/	A fake Russian troll account suspended months ago is the subject of a fake news headline about House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and a sexual abuse scandal. "Tennessee GOP Twitter taken down, after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia," stated the Nov. 26 headline on Puppet String News, a fake news website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article showed an alleged tweet by @TEN_GOP: "I’ve seen a check that has Nancy Pelosi’s signature because she authorized a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim’s family has told me they’ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout. #draintheswamp #Shushfund." (We assume that "take" is a typo and was supposed to say "talk.") We searched news accounts and found nothing about Pelosi authorizing such a payout. The tweet appears to be the only source of the information. According to RBC, a Russian media company with a history of independence, @TEN_GOP was a Russian troll account. It had posted 10,000 tweets by the time it was shut down in August 2017, two years after it launched. The fake account had nearly 150,000 followers -- far more than the real state party’s twitter account of about 13,000. The real Tennessee Republican Party contacted Twitter multiple times to report that @TEN_GOP was impersonating the party’s actual account. "It was very misleading, pretending to be our office," Tennessee Republican Party communications director Candice Dawkins told PolitiFact Twitter’s press office didn’t respond to an email from PolitiFact. Before the election, @TEN_GOP tweeted a series of misinformation, according to the New York Times, such as ''Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.'' The Washington Post reported that the list of prominent people who tweeted out links from the account included political figures such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, celebrities such as Nicki Minaj and James Woods, and media personalities such as Ann Coulter and Chris Hayes. Twitter has said it had discovered that 2,752 accounts controlled by Russians. The headline on Puppet String News states, "Tennessee GOP twitter taken down after tweet exposing Pelosi involved in pedophilia." Actually, Twitter took down the fake Russian news account in August, and we found no evidence that Pelosi was involved in a payout related to pedophilia. The Puppet String News’ website states that it was created by a U.S. Navy veteran who "decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability."

pomt-05646	"(GM and Chrysler) repaid their loans."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/21/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-campaign-video-says-auto-co/	A new Barack Obama campaign video narrated by Tom Hanks portrays the president’s bailout of General Motors and Chrysler as courageous and successful — with loans repaid by car companies. "Because of the tough choices the president made, the stage was set for a resurgent U.S. auto industry," Hanks says in the 17-minute highlights reel of Obama’s presidency, titled The Road We’ve Traveled. "With business booming, (GM and Chrysler) repaid their loans," he later concludes. It’s a claim we’ve heard before from the CEOs of GM and Chrysler in 2010 and 2011. At the time, we rated their claims Half True. But it’s been months since we’ve looked at this question, so we thought we’d ask again. We’re not checking the overall merit of the government’s efforts to support the car companies, which relies on opinion. Instead, we’re checking some of the facts marshaled by filmmakers. In another item, we checked whether auto bailout money had run out by the time Obama took office. We rated that Mostly True. And here we’ll check whether GM and Chrysler "repaid their loans" from U.S. taxpayers. The bailouts We reached out to the car companies, consulted a detailed accounting of Bush and Obama administration rescues kept by the Pulitzer-winning ProPublica, consulted the U.S. Treasury and reviewed other reports and fact-checks on this topic. The story begins in late 2008, when the U.S. economy was crashing. By early December, GM and Chrysler told the government they couldn’t get the credit they needed to survive, threatening more than 1 million jobs, according to a report from the Congressional Oversight Panel. President George W. Bush’s administration provided the auto companies with short-term funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program — remember TARP? — support that was continued under Obama with additional loans that financed the companies’ bankruptcy reorganizations. The 2009 report predicted, "Although taxpayers may recover some portion of their investment in Chrysler and GM, it is unlikely they will recover the entire amount." In September 2011, the Treasury reported that it expected the auto bailouts to "cost the taxpayer just under $24 billion." How does this square with the statement that the companies have "repaid their loans"? Some government money was offered as loans — but much more was used to purchase stock. Meanwhile, during restructuring, GM and Chrysler were divided into "old" and "new" companies. And the car companies' consumer finance arms also received aid in the effort to avoid shutdowns. Our tally of ProPublica’s work on General Motors, GMAC, Chrysler and Chrysler Financial Services shows that of $80 billion spent by taxpayers on the entire bailout, we’re still waiting on nearly $40 billion, a number confirmed by the Treasury Department. At some point, selling taxpayers’ stock in GM and GMAC may earn back a chunk of the rest. But all of it? The story’s not over yet. What part of that was loans? Let's look at each automaker. Chrysler The government’s bailout of "Chrysler" actually involved government infusions totaling more than $12 billion to three companies. One was the automaker prior to its bankruptcy reorganization, the old Chrysler. One was the reorganized company, Chrysler Group. And the third was the company that provided consumer auto loans, Chrysler Financial Services. Just two of the three have satisfied their government obligations. But the film's "repaid" rhetoric reflects solely the Chrysler Group — the new Chrysler. What’s the larger story? • Since Chrysler Group LLC was formed in June 2009, it has repaid its U.S. loans of $5.1 billion "in full, with interest, six years early," according to a fact-sheet from Katie Merx, financial communications manager for the reorganized company. (The Treasury also says so.) Another chunk of money bought the government a small ownership stake in the new company, but that’s already been bought by Fiat. So, the Chrysler Group, the entity that arose out of the bankruptcy, has repaid its loans and has shed government ownership. • Chrysler Financial Services, now TD Auto Finance, has paid off its loan of $1.5 billion — and taxpayers made $22 million on the deal, according to the Treasury Department and ProPublica. • But the amount taxpayers loaned to Chrysler before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 — the entity now dubbed "Old Carco" — was chalked up as a loss by the federal government. That’s a $1.3 billion loan that will never be repaid. (The old company is still grinding through liquidation, but the government doesn’t expect to collect any more.) So, new Chrysler has "repaid its loans," as has Chrysler Financial Services. But old Chrysler was lent $1.3 billion that won’t be repaid. Even so, taxpayers have fared better than most folks thought — a government official suggested in 2009 that $7 billion might be lost. Instead, most taxpayer money has been restored, and the new company says it has added more than 9,000 jobs. General Motors GM’s story is even more dramatic. Its $67 billion bailout also involved three companies, the old GM, the GM that emerged out of bankruptcy reorganization and auto financing arm GMAC, which is now Ally Financial. • The new company received $6.7 billion in secured loans. In April 2010, GM repaid them with interest — and touted it had "repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule." But billions of dollars more had been converted to a 61 percent stake in the new company, said James Cain, financial news manager for GM. That stake is now down to 32 percent of the company’s common stock. The question is how much that stock will earn taxpayers to offset $27 billion not yet recouped from old and new GM. A third of GM’s entire stock value as of March 19, 2012, was just $13 billion. (Check its current market capitalization.) • The former GMAC still has substantial government ownership – more than 70 percent of its common stock is held by taxpayers, according to the Treasury Department — but no loans. According to ProPublica, there’s more than $11 billion left on the GMAC ledger. So it’s not yet clear how taxpayers will fare. • Old GM got nearly $1 billion in loans, and the Treasury Department has so far squeezed $136 million out of the company as it is liquidated in bankruptcy court. But it’s not clear how much taxpayers will ultimately recoup. GM has certainly used the reboot to roar back into the marketplace. Its sales, along with those of its Chinese affiliates, were No. 1 in the world in 2011. (Aided the fact that its main competitor, Toyota, grappled with an earthquake, tsunami and floods.) But we’re not measuring the bailout’s success — merely the question of loan repayment. As with Chrysler, new GM has repaid its "loans," while old GM may fail to repay $850 million. Unlike Chrysler, the government still owns a third of GM and more than 70 percent of the former GMAC — stock that taxpayers can hope will one day earn enough to make them whole. Our ruling So the Obama campaign is echoing a claim from GM and Chrysler that the auto companies "repaid their loans." But for both companies, that’s some careful framing that doesn’t tell the whole story. Loans represent about 20 percent of the bailout. Meanwhile, the statement is only fully true of the new automakers. A look at the entire bailout shows loans to the old car companies that may never be repaid, plus outstanding stock investments in GM and the former GMAC. The new companies, which got about 85 percent of the loans, have repaid them all. In our lengthy discussions about this claim, we considered everything from Mostly True to Mostly False. We’re not weighing Obama’s courage or the bailout’s success. We can say the claim the current companies "repaid their loans" is accurate but leaves out important details and context. On the larger bailout, it’s too early to say how taxpayers will make out. This statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12148	"At the end of 2016, there were 23 percent fewer federal prosecutions than in 2011, so (prosecutors) looked at this scourge (opioid deaths) and they let it go by."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/aug/09/donald-trump/trump-blames-obama-decline-federal-drug-prosecutio/	President Donald Trump took a swipe at former President Barack Obama as he renewed his pledge to tackle the opioid epidemic, which claims the lives of tens of thousands of people a year. Trump said that opioid overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled since 1999, speaking after a briefing on the issue. But while deaths soared, Trump said overall drug prosecutions declined in recent years -- a trend Trump vowed to reverse. "We're going to be bringing them up and bringing them up rapidly," he said Aug. 8. "At the end of 2016, there were 23 percent fewer than in 2011. So they looked at this scourge, and they let it go by, and we're not letting it go by." We found that Trump is correct that federal drug prosecutions declined from 2011 to 2016 under Obama, but he lacks evidence to prove that’s the culprit for the opioid overdose crisis. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the record. Federal drug prosecutions declined under Obama The Justice Department filed drug charges against 24,638 defendants in 2016, down 23 percent from 2011, according to the Pew Research Center, which analyzed federal data. The data reflects felonies and some serious misdemeanors. But that’s overall drug prosecutions, not just prosecutions related to opioids. And it only includes federal prosecutions -- the vast majority of criminal prosecutions are in state courts. We found that the drop was due to some of the specific actions the Obama administration took to stop the prosecution of low-level offenders. Pew noted that in 2013, then-Attorney General Eric Holder directed federal prosecutors to ensure that each case they brought served "a substantial federal interest." Holder mandated that certain low-level nonviolent drug offenders, with no ties to gangs or cartels, would no longer face mandatory minimum sentences. He called for more treatment and alternatives to prison. Also in 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys related to prioritizing marijuana prosecutions. He directed attorneys to focus on cartels or other criminal organizations and the use of violence to distribute the drug. Federal marijuana prosecutions fell to 5,158 in 2016, down 39 percent from five years earlier, Pew found. Obama-era drop in drug prosecutions not to blame for opioid overdoses Trump implied that lack of prosecutions likely led to a worsening of the opioid crisis. But experts we contacted had a different view. "No serious analyst would argue that federal prosecutions have consequences for opioid overdoses," said University of Maryland criminology professor Peter Reuter. "The drivers of that increase are the arrival of fentanyl, since about 2012, and the overprescription of opioids before it. There has been some decline in heroin retail prices. But no prior effort against high-level distributors and traffickers has ever had sustained success at the retail level." Some drug experts including Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy and Management, have criticized Obama for taking too long to address the crisis, but not because of a lack of prosecutions. "Obama deserves blame for neglecting the epidemic and failing to ensure a coordinated federal response," Kolodny said. "I can think of several areas where it's fair to criticize him. The decline in federal drug prosecutions is not one of them." Trump has a point that the Obama administration was slow to respond to the opioid crisis, said Jon Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon professor and expert on drug policy. "Anyone looking at the basic death stats knew we had a problem by 2000," Caulkins said. "So this is a national disgrace, and Obama was in power for eight of the more recent years, and if ‘the buck stops on the president’s desk’ then it’s fair to put some blame there." A September 2016 report from the Obama administration’s Justice Department found that prosecutors could help combat the epidemic by prioritizing prosecution of heroin distributors and of medical professionals who improperly prescribe opioids. The report also stated that federal prosecution had "lagged," and more prosecutors were needed. The report noted, however, that investigations "can be difficult when the victim is deceased and the source of the drugs is not immediately obvious." Our ruling Trump said "at the end of 2016, there were 23 percent fewer federal prosecutions than in 2011, so (prosecutors) looked at this surge and they let it go by." Trump made the statement in the context of rising opioid overdose deaths. An analysis of data shows that federal drug charges overall declined 23 percent between 2011 and 2016. But that data doesn’t tell us anything about opioid cases specifically. Where Trump misses the mark is his suggestion that the drop in prosecutions is to blame for the opioid epidemic, which started before Obama’s tenure and then grew worse during his presidency. Obama could have done more earlier to address the epidemic, experts said, but there is no evidence that his strategy on federal drug prosecutions led to a spike in opioid overdose deaths.

pomt-07369	According to crime statistics, "riding MARTA has been becoming more and more safe over the years."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/may/06/jim-durrett/marta-chair-says-transit-system-more-and-more-safe/	A witness account of a recent attack on a MARTA train had the makings of a gritty TV drama. It took place just before midnight on a Saturday. The train car doors slid open at Garnett Station. A mob of teens streamed in, chanting the initials of a notorious Atlanta gang. The doors closed. There was nowhere to run. "There was blood everywhere. People were hollering and screaming," a rider told Channel 2 Action News. The April 16 attack left two Delta Air Lines employees with minor injuries. The witness account, criticized as sensational and inaccurate by MARTA officials, revived public anxiety over safety on the public transit system. New MARTA Board Chairman Jim Durrett tried to reassure the public during an April 28 interview with Denis O’Hayer on WABE-FM (90.1). "When you look at crime statistics, riding MARTA has been becoming more and more safe over the years," Durrett said. More and more safe? What about 14-year-old Rueben Hand III, whose throat was slashed New Year’s Day at Five Points Station? And chess champ Anthony Beavers, 19, who was shot to death during a robbery at the East Point station in March 2010? Police made arrests in both slayings, as well as last month’s attack. Transit agency spokeswoman Cara Hodgson referred PolitiFact Georgia to crime statistics on the MARTA website. She also sent us a written statement that said, in part, that Durrett’s statement was "unequivocally accurate and reasonable." We took our own look at MARTA’s crime data. They tell a more nuanced story. The transit system is policed by the MARTA Police Department, a full-service, nationally accredited law enforcement agency with about 300 sworn personnel, its own criminal investigations unit, and an emergency call center. It’s responsible for law enforcement at MARTA’s buildings, stations, trains, buses and vans. MARTA police sends its crime statistics to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which publishes them each year. The most recent data is from 2009. Durrett did not specify during his WABE interview the years he thinks the transit system became safer. The data Hodgson referenced covered four years. Since the FBI’s data was more comprehensive, we used that agency’s numbers. Crime on the transit system is rare, according to FBI statistics on "Part I" crime, a category of serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, larceny and burglary that are more commonly reported to police. And overall, crime on MARTA is dropping, the data shows. Part I offenses are down a whopping 42 percent during the past decade, from 752 incidents to 438. This decline was led by a drop in nonviolent property crimes, which are by far the most common type. But violent crime rose 8percent to 163 incidents from 2000 to 2009. The increase was led by a 26 percent climb in aggravated assaults to 96 attacks. Murder and rapes generally held steady while robbery declined. Violent attacks increased even as MARTA ridership dipped by 6 percent to less than 157 million unlinked trips, or passenger boardings, according to federal statistics. The increase in violent crime is more dramatic over a five-year period. Those offenses increased by 36 percent from 2005 through 2009, led by a 27 percent jump in robbery and 41 percent increase in aggravated assault. This took place as ridership climbed by 10 percent. So do statistics show riding MARTA has become "more and more safe," as Chairman Durrett said? People on MARTA are less likely to be victims of crime than they were 10 years ago. This is especially true for property crimes. Riders are much less likely to have their wallets swiped. Still, they are somewhat more likely to get violently attacked. Durrett’s remark did not give this factor the weight it deserves. For this reason, he earns a Half True.	None	Jim Durrett	None	None	None	2011-05-06T06:00:00	2011-04-28	['None']

pomt-09739	Seniors with coverage under Medicare Advantage will give up "more than their share" because of health care reform	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/16/americas-health-insurance-plans/health-insurers-group-says-medicare-advantage-bene/	One of the Republicans' favorite arguments against the Democratic health care reform proposals is that seniors could be hurt by cuts to Medicare. America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the health insurance industry, began running television advertisements on this point in mid October. One ad, aimed at residents of Missouri, posed the following question: "Is it right to ask 10 million seniors on Medicare Advantage for more than their share? Congress is proposing over $100 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says many seniors will see cuts in benefits." For this item, we're examining whether people in Medicare Advantage would give up "more than their share" because of health care reform. First, some background about Medicare Advantage. There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They can enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover many of their out-of-pocket costs. Or they can enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (including a drug plan) that are run by private insurers. About 23 percent of people covered by Medicare are Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. They often receive more generous benefits, such as dental and vision coverage, or gym memberships. Some plans pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. The reason Medicare Advantage plans are more generous is that they usually receive higher reimbursement rates from the federal government. Ironically, Medicare Advantage was initially conceived as a way of lowering Medicare costs through competition. But in the complicated way the program is structured, things have turned out differently. Today, Medicare Advantage costs taxpayers about 14 percent more per capita than traditional Medicare — a financial burden borne both by traditional Medicare beneficiaries (through their Medicare premiums, which are deducted from their Social Security checks) and by taxpayers generally (through payroll deductions earmarked for Medicare). Currently, everyone in Medicare — both traditional and Medicare Advantage — pays an extra $3 per month to cover the higher costs of Medicare Advantage. The bills working their way through Congress would change this system, equalizing what the government pays for Medicare and Medicare Advantage. That's where the savings referenced in the AHIP ad come in. The second and third sentences of the ad — about funding cuts to Medicare Advantage and the CBO saying that many seniors will see fewer benefits — appear to be correct. CBO has estimated that under the Senate Finance Committee's original bill the cuts to Medicare Advantage would total $117 billion between 2010 and 2019. And CBO estimated that the original House bill would cut the program by $156 billion over the same period. That's clearly "over $100 billion" in cuts. Meanwhile, the ad is correct that CBO — or, more precisely, CBO's director, Douglas Elmendorf — said that these funding cuts would result in benefit cuts to seniors. "They would not receive as much additional benefits [as they do] in the current Medicare Advantage system," Elmendorf testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Sept. 22, 2009. Most experts we contacted agreed with Elmendorf that some benefits for Medicare Advantage participants would likely be cut if the new funding rules are enacted. It should be noted, however, that these cuts would not reduce the basic package of Medicare benefits that Medicare Advantage providers must offer. Rather, the cuts will come from the extra benefits that Medicare Advantage providers typically offer their patients, using the extra government money they get. The specific mix of cuts would be determined by the insurer, not by the bill. In fact, the existence of Medicare Advantage's extra layer of benefits complicates the task of determining whether the first sentence of AHIP's ad — "Is it right to ask 10 million seniors on Medicare Advantage for more than their share?" — frames the issue accurately. The implication that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are losing more than their share "is not accurate," said Stuart Guterman, a Medicare expert at the Commonwealth Fund, which studies health care policy. "I think there's no doubt there will be cuts in benefits for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. But they've been getting more than their share up to now." "We think it is misleading," agreed Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, a group that supports health care reform. "There's no mention of the 30 million-plus seniors who don't benefit from Medicare Advantage, but whose premiums are higher in order to subsidize the program, or the taxpayers who subsidize it." Robert Moffit, who directs the Center for Health Policy Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, is generally positive about Medicare Advantage, writing in a recent paper, "Medicare Advantage provides seniors with choice, variety, and value." But even he has problems with the way AHIP worded the first sentence of the ad. "I don't know what the question means," he told PolitiFact. "I frankly think it's a vague sentence." Ultimately, AHIP's ad correctly communicates the facts about the size of the proposed Medicare Advantage cuts and their effect on beneficiaries. But the trade group spins these facts to their advantage and leaves out important context. The ad does not specify that cuts to Medicare Advantage would be made to extra benefits provided by insurers under Medicare Advantage, not to core benefits, which will remain untouched. In addition, it says that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are taking a hit that's "more than their share" — an assertion that glosses over the fact that the government is currently paying 14 percent more for their coverage than it does for beneficiaries of traditional Medicare. We rate the statement Half True.	None	America's Health Insurance Plans	None	None	None	2009-10-16T16:26:49	2009-10-15	['None']
pomt-00662	Says Mike Huckabee appeared in diabetes infomercials to endorse "cures and treatments that no health agency supports."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/13/ron-fournier/mike-huckabee-and-diabetes-cure-he-endorsed-no-hea/	Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is distancing himself from the unusual ways he earned money before announcing his White House run May 5, but journalists aren’t letting the former Arkansas governor off the hook. Huckabee, who shed about 100 pounds after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, filmed TV and radio infomercials advertising a program to "reverse" diabetes in February and March. Huckabee also lent his email list to carry ads about a looming food shortage and a cancer cure found in the Bible. CBS’ Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer tried to pin Huckabee down on his business dealings during a May 10 interview that followed a critical column about "Huckabee’s Hucksterism" by National Journal’s Ron Fournier. Huckabee got testy as he explained the program he endorsed is more about healthy eating than dietary supplements. A bit later, Schieffer moved on to Fournier during a pundit panel discussion for a response. "As you know, there was more to that, and I really like the way you kind of put him on his heels and he had to filibuster you," Fournier said. "He -- his endorsing -- the infomercials that are endorsing cures and treatments that no health agency supports. He's linking cancer to cures to the Bible verse." In other words, he said, not very presidential behavior. PunditFact wanted to dig into Fournier’s claim about Huckabee’s past. Did he shill for a shoddy diabetes "cure" that "no health agency supports"? ‘Diabetes Solution Kit’ Fournier’s column references a March New York Times story about Huckabee’s "highly unconventional income streams." In a since-deleted video (though you can see one on the Daily Mail), Huckabee encouraged viewers to buy the Diabetes Solution Kit made by the South Dakota company Barton Publishing. In the video, Huckabee promises diabetes can be reversed ("I should know because I did it") and condemns "mainstream" treatment methods of insulin injections and prescriptions. "Prescription drugs aren’t going to cure you," Huckabee tells viewers. "They’re only going to keep you a loyal pill-popping, finger-pricking, insulin shooting customer so Big Pharma and the mainstream medical community can rake in over $100 billion a year annually." After explaining how he used "the same techniques" outlined in the Diabetes Solution Kit, Huckabee asks viewers to "sit tight, because in a moment a free presentation is coming up that’ll show you everything you need to know about the Diabetes Solution Kit so you can discover all the natural secrets that are backed by real science that really work." That free presentation lasts more than 30 minutes, kicking off with a spokesman named Lon showing a picture of cinnamon rolls that "contain a real ingredient that reverses diabetes" and going on to berate insulin, diabetes pills and other injectables as treatments. (We sat through it so you don’t have to.) The kit turns out to be booklets offering tips for eating, exercise, and yes, formulating dietary supplements — for the low, low price of $19.97. "We don’t sell pills," said Barton Publishing chief marketing officer Marty Fahncke. "We sell books that do, in fact, teach people how to reverse their diabetes." However, the video discusses at length the "Double C Diabetes Remedy" of cinnamon and chromium picolinate, which is described as a "weird, spice, kitchen cabinet cure" that "will allow you to live life just like when you didn’t have diabetes at all." Lon the narrator calls this precise combination of cinnamon and chromium picolinate a "cornerstone" of the system. Huckabee’s campaign did not return an email seeking comment for this story. Huckabee told Schieffer that he is no longer doing the infomercials as a presidential candidate. The Barton Publishing press release about Huckabee’s endorsement deal says he was "given just 10 years to live" by a doctor who diagnosed him with Type 2 diabetes in 2004. This contradicts Huckabee’s own account of his diagnosis as documented by the media. According to the Associated Press, Huckabee was diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes in 2002. He lost 50 pounds within about two months after following a diet created by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. By 2004, he had lost 100 pounds through healthy eating and fitness. Newspaper accounts contain no mention of a cinnamon and chromium compound helping Huckabee through, and Huckabee is careful in the video to avoid saying he followed the Diabetes Solution Kit. The closest he gets is saying the he "used the same techniques to lose 110 pounds of fat, get my own blood sugar under control, and completely reverse my Type 2 diabetes." Position of diabetes associations So that’s the diabetes solution Huckabee was being paid to promote. The question is: Do health agencies say it works? The New York Times story describes the American Diabetes Association and Canadian Diabetes Association as warning that dietary and herbal supplements "are ineffective for treating diabetes," linking to a page of only the American group’s website. The ADA’s Diabetes.org page is slightly more nuanced than outright calling the supplements ineffective, but nowhere does it signal support for herbal remedies: "It is best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat. In fact, research has not been able to prove that dietary or herbal supplements (including omega-3 supplements, cinnamon, and other herbs) help to manage diabetes." The organization cites a National Health Interview Survey that acknowledges use of herbal therapy or dietary supplements among one-fifth or one-third, respectively, of people with diabetes, especially in minority ethnic groups. The Canadian Diabetes Association was more straight-forward: It "does not support the use of the dietary supplements advertised in these infomercials." Fahncke of Barton Publishing sent PunditFact links to various Web pages of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Diabetes Association, Mayo Clinic, and a journal called Nutrition Research. The links either talk about the importance of a healthy diet to control diabetes (and don’t mention herbal supplements at all) or discuss small studies in China and Pakistan that showed cinnamon supplements might reduce risk factors in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Still, none of the links offer strong support for the cinnamon-chromium mixture recommended in the Diabetes Solution Kit — much less the endorsement of a reputable health agency. Other expert opinions Other endocrinologists we contacted were more blunt: The promised kitchen cabinet remedy does not work. "There is no scientific support for herbal treatments in the care of diabetes," said Dr. Domenico Accili, Columbia University professor medicine and director of the Columbia University Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center. "The concoction of cinnamon and chromium has been sold for many years, and it’s pure quackery." Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, a past president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and attending physician in the endocrinology, diabetes and bone disease division of New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital, said even though chromium and cinnamon are "associated with salutary effects on glucose and insulin physiology in animals and in vitro," there are insufficient clinical data to back up a recommendation for the product. Even though consuming either the spice cinnamon or mineral chromium picolinate is inherently low risk, Mechanick said, there are several reasons to avoid the combined product, including insufficient regulation and a lack of strong science. "The philosophy of using (dietary supplements and nutraceuticals) to manage diabetes instead of proven lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies is harmful," he said. Food and Drug Administration spokesman Eric Pahon said people who "rely on products which have not been reviewed by FDA for safety and efficacy" — e.g. Diabetes Solution Kit’s cinnamon and chromium picolinate recommendation — "may place themselves at increased risk of poorly controlled diabetes and other risks." Our ruling Fournier said "no health agencies support" the "cures and treatments" that Huckabee endorsed in an infomercial promising diabetes reversal. Health groups and physicians that specialize in diabetes told us they do not support the approach to "reversing diabetes" outlined in the Diabetes Solution Kit that Huckabee used to endorse.

pomt-00363	Says Steve Chabot "voted to strip insurance protections for pre-existing conditions."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/sep/12/aftab-pureval/chabots-votes-contradict-his-health-care-talk/	With their race squeaky tight, accusatory fingers are being pointed between Steve Chabot, the Republican incumbent in Ohio’s 1st Congressional District, and his Democratic challenger, Aftab Pureval. Two TV ads from Pureval, one with an on-camera assist from a mother whose now-teen-age daughter had cancer at age 7, claim that Chabot voted to strip mandatory health insurance protections for people for pre-existing conditions. That could have led to exorbitant premiums for the sickest Americans or denial of coverage altogether. It’s as if Chabot would have punished the child throughout her life for successfully fighting cancer, the mother says in the ad. The mother, Colleen Bowman, and her daughter, Ella Bowman, now 14, are seated on a couch next to Pureval, who begins the commercial saying, "Thank you so much for trusting me with your story." Then over the sound of music box-like piano and violin, the mother says, "Like I said in many letters and messages to Steve Chabot, if they take away the pre-existing condition protections, you’re punishing the child cancer survivor for surviving cancer. That’s pretty disgusting." Yet that’s exactly what Chabot would have done, Pureval contended in a different ad about a week earlier: "Steve Chabot, a career politician who voted to strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions," that ad’s announcer said. Chabot shot back in his own ad, with an announcer saying, "Aftab Pureval just can’t seem the tell the truth. He’s lying about Steve Chabot’s health care record." Sounds like it’s time for a fact-check. Protections for pre-existing conditions To understand Pureval’s health care claim, we need to start with the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, signed by President Barack Obama. It required most Americans to have health insurance, and health insurers had to cover any patient who applied and paid premiums. Some of those premiums were covered by taxpayer subsidies. The act, known in shorthand as both the ACA and Obamacare, prohibited charging premiums based on an applicant’s health status or prior medical conditions. It allowed insurers to charge higher premiums for their oldest members, but no more than three times as high as premiums charged for the youngest members. Republicans including Chabot disliked the ACA from the start. It was economically unsustainable, they said, and while Obama claimed premiums would go down, they went up for a number of families, and some were forced to buy coverage they didn’t want. Furthermore, congressional critics said, it was an assault on the ideals of free markets and individual choice. So they tried to repeal it. They voted multiple times, generally garnering enough votes for passage in the House, which Republicans retook in the late 2010 election, but failing in the Senate. Chabot voted with the majority. Therefore, Pureval says, Chabot voted to strip protections from people with pre-existing conditions. Chabot’s record of rhetoric, however, is more complex. He has spoken about keeping protections for pre-existing conditions. Counters the Pureval campaign: Talk is cheap. Votes are what matter. Chabot’s votes In Pureval’s ad that started running Aug. 28, three of Chabot’s votes are shown scrolling down the screen. H.R. 2, the "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act." The text of the bill spoke entirely of repeal and did not state a desire or intention to keep any provisions. It passed 249-189 on Jan. 19, 2011, almost entirely along partisan lines. H.R. 6079, the "Repeal of Obamacare Act" of 2012, cited numerous criticisms of the ACA and called for restoring pre-ACA rules as if Obamacare "had not been enacted." It did not discuss pre-existing conditions. The House passed it 244-185, with every Republican voting "yes." H.R. 569, a 2015 bill with a lengthy name but the same stated purpose: to repeal the ACA. This bill, however, spoke of "replacement legislation" and ordered that four separate House committees work on new components. One of provisions lawmakers would work on if the broader repeal bill passed first: "Provide people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage." On a partisan vote, H.R. 569 passed the House 239-186. Chabot says those votes in isolation distort his record Chabot says he never wanted to end the protection for people with pre-existing conditions. In 2017, for example, House Republicans passed H.R 1628, the American Health Care Act, with a vote of 217-213. It would give "states the ability, if they choose, to craft health care solutions that work better for local patients, while at the same time guaranteeing that those with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied health care coverage," Chabot said in a statement after the vote. In 2014, Chabot endorsed a list of possible ACA alternatives, writing in the Cincinnati Enquirer that they could include "allowing young people to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26 and addressing the pre-existing condition challenge." In December 2013, Chabot and 33 other Republicans wrote to Obama seeking a meeting to discuss health care reform, with a proposed agenda that included "guaranteeing people with pre-existing conditions can get affordable coverage." Some context In an ideal world, talk might equal action. But that’s Pureval’s very contention: Despite Chabot’s talk, the incumbent voted to repeal the ACA without assuring there would be protections for people with preexisting conditions. The Cincinnati Enquirer made a similar point in 2011, shortly before that first 2011 repeal vote. "Chabot acknowledged that certain changes are needed," the news article said, citing Chabot’s agreement on the "need to prohibit insurers from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions, canceling coverage once an insured person gets sick, and allow parents to keep children on their policy until age 26. "But he acknowledged that there aren't any current plans for the House to enact those changes if a repeal passes," the article noted. Chabot voted for it anyway. Even the 2017 repeal-and-replace bill, the American Health Care Act, had potential weaknesses. A Columbus Dispatch article on the bill pointed out that if someone with a pre-existing condition bought a policy on the insurance exchanges "but let it lapse for more than 63 days, the insurance company could charge a higher premium." Similarly, the 2015 vote that required congressional committees to work on replacement bills did nothing to assure any such replacement bills would ever get a hearing, much less a vote, Sarah Topy, Pureval’s campaign manager, said in an email to PolitiFact. It was just more rhetoric, she said. The GOP didn’t mean it Chabot’s response to all this is unusual: Yes, he voted for Obamacare repeal bills that did not include keeping protections for pre-existing conditions, but Republicans and Democrats alike knew those bills could not pass the Senate or get Obama’s signature. Votes like this were part of a legislative strategy but, Chabot’s campaign said, few lawmakers really meant it when they said only "repeal" and not "replace." "Here's the thing," Chabot campaign spokesman Cody Rizzuto said in an email to PolitiFact. "Everyone knew that none of these votes were going anywhere as long as President Obama was in the White House." He added that "the votes Aftab cites were all taken while President Obama was in office. As such, they weren't going to be become law. Obamacare wasn't going to be repealed with President Obama's signature. Everyone knew that, and so a replacement bill wasn't necessary. You don't need a replace when there won't be a repeal." The nature of the bills and the addition of replacement language changed, he said, once Republicans regained a Senate majority and then Donald Trump was elected president. With a real chance of passage, Rizzuto said, the bills focused more specifically on individual elements. He added that while Pureval attacked Chabot on pre-existing conditions, he did so without ever mentioning that the actual votes were on Obamacare. "Aftab is relying on votes repealing an unpopular program, without ever mentioning that program (Obamacare)," Rizzuto said. "This is intentional, because tying the issue to Obamacare repeal would directly undermine his attack in this district. Our ruling Chabot has said repeatedly that he would like to have protections covering people with pre-existing conditions. When presented with bills that lacked the protections, however, he has voted for them anyway. His campaign says the votes weren’t meaningful because the legislation was never going to become law and everyone knew it. We cannot say that when Congress members, elected to make laws, vote for a new law, constituents should take it with a grain of salt. There are certainly political and strategic calculations. The Truth-O-Meter can only measure what a politician says and what he or she did. The connection between the ACA and pre-existing conditions was eminently clear throughout the repeal debate.

pomt-09583	"We have over 300 state agencies. Forty-five of those agencies are related to health care."	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/25/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-we-have-45-health-related-state-age/	Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, running for governor, said she wouldn't hesitate to trim state spending to cope with a looming state revenue shortfall of up to $17 billion. "We should start cutting across the board now in our state agencies," she said during the GOP gubernatorial debate Jan. 14. "We have over 300 state agencies. Forty-five of those agencies are related to health care. I'm just wondering if we couldn't consolidate some of those state agencies." Forty-five agencies, all concerned with health care? We decided to check. Hutchison's campaign sent us a list of 50 councils, boards, committees and state departments, all characterized by Hutchison's camp as relating to health care in some capacity. The 50 were plucked from a list of more than 300 entities that the governor was making appointments to as of February 2008. Case closed? Not quite. The veracity of Hutchison's statement depends on how broadly "agency" is defined. Two experts we spoke with understood how Hutchison made the stretch. But Harvey Tucker, a political science professor at Texas A&M, said that according to how state law defines what constitutes an agency, Hutchison "probably went too far." Ken Levine, interim director of the Sunset Advisory Commission, which reviews government agencies and makes recommendations to the Legislature about what services can be consolidated, declined to weigh in on the truthfulness of Hutchison's claim. But he said that it's not realistic to count all the entities on Hutchison's list as full-fledged agencies. For instance, the governor appoints members of advisory committees — we counted four of them on Hutchison's list, including the Dental Hygiene and the Family Practice Residency advisory committees. But "I wouldn't count those as state agencies," Levine said. Also, some of the entities Hutchison may envision as targets for possible consolidation to cut costs don't cost much money now. The vast majority of advisory committee members are not salaried state workers. Put another way, panels including the Dental Hygiene Advisory Committee do not have line-item appropriations in the budget. The dental hygiene panel's six members only get state money to reimburse travel expenses. Separately, we found three published state lists that put Hutchison's claim of 45 health-related agencies in question. According to an appendix to the latest state budget and compilations by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts and the Texas State Library and Archives, Texas has no more than 15 health-related agencies including the mammoth Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees smaller units. One way Hutchison gets to a higher number is by counting components of some agencies as if they were separate entities. For instance, Hutchison includes on her list the Executive Council of Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Examiners plus the Texas Board of Occupational Therapy Examiners and the Texas Board of Physical Therapy Examiners. A council spokeswoman told us that those three entities amount to one state agency. Except for a section of the state ethics code relating to financial disclosure by public officials, it's difficult to find a strict definition or criteria for what constitutes a state agency in Texas. We decided to take the state's word for how many health-related government agencies it has: 15, including the five health and human services agencies traditionally associated with health care. Hutchison's list — ranging from the sprawling HHSC to itty-bitties like the Chronic Kidney Disease Task Force — shapes up as overly long. We rule her claim False.

pomt-15128	Under the Iran deal: "If Israel attacks Iran … we’re supposed to be on Iran’s side."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/04/donald-trump/trump-says-iran-deal-forces-us-defend-iran-if-its-/	Donald Trump says the Iran nuclear deal would force the United States to defend Iran if it were attacked by Israel. He denounced the deal as "horrendous" during a Sept. 3 radio interview on "The John Fredericks Show," a Hampton Roads-based broadcast that’s aired through much of Virginia. Trump added: "If Israel attacks Iran, I think -- of course this wouldn’t happen, it wouldn’t happen with me, with Obama you never know -- but we’re supposed to be on Iran’s side if this happens. OK? And nobody knows this and even talks about that point but, basically, we’re supposed to protect them." The Republican front-runner for the White House made similar comments a day earlier during a CNN interview. "You know, there is something in the Iran deal that people I don't think really understand or know about," he said. "And nobody is able it to explain it, that if somebody attacks Iran, we have to come to their defense." Trump’s comments come on the heels of events that all but guarantee the U.S. will participate with other nations in a deal in which Iran will curb its short-term nuclear ambitions in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., announced her support for the accord on Sept. 2, making her the 34th senator to do so. That means opponents will be unable to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override President Barack Obama’s pledged veto of a congressional vote to defeat the deal. We asked Trump’s campaign for backup on the candidate’s statements and didn’t hear back. But the claim is familiar to PolitiFact; it also has been made by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and debated in Israel. Let’s zero in. The Iran deal At the heart of the claim is Article 10, Annex III, of the accord which states: "E3/EU+3 parties, and possibly other states, as appropriate, are prepared to cooperate with Iran on the implementation of nuclear security guidelines and best practices." That includes the following: • "Co-operation in the form of training courses and workshops to strengthen Iran's ability to prevent, protect and respond to nuclear security threats to nuclear facilities and systems as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems; • "Co-operation through training and workshops to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against, and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage, as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems." This article has been criticized in the Israeli media. "One of the clauses in the nuclear deal reached between world powers and Iran last week guarantees that the world powers will assist Iran in thwarting attempts to undermine its nuclear program," Israel Hayom, a newsletter, said July 20. But experts told PolitiFact Florida in late July that such interpretations are, at best, exaggerated. The aim of the provision, they said, is to protect nuclear materials from theft (say, if terrorists tried to steal Iranian assets) or from sabotage (with the intent of causing a hazardous-materials threat to health). For years, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, the United States has pushed countries around the world to improve security for their nuclear material and facilities, said Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard and an expert on nuclear theft and terrorism. This agreement furthers that goal, he said. "It has nothing to do with helping Iran protect its nuclear facilities from a military attack" of the kind that Israel or Egypt might carry out, Bunn said. "It’s about protecting against thieves and terrorists who might want to steal nuclear material or sabotage a nuclear facility." Bunn added that by its plain language, the provision does not obligate any of the signatories, including the United States, to do anything in particular. Rather, it says the signatories are "prepared" to cooperate with Iran on these topics, with lots of wiggle room for all sides. "My guess is that very little cooperation in these areas will take place," Bunn said. Russia and China might be willing to do some training, but nothing would force the United States to do so. If the United States did participate, there’s even some historical precedent for intelligence gains from this sort of activity, Bunn said. He said American cooperation with Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union dramatically reduced the risk that nuclear material would be stolen and gave the U.S. insights into the Russian nuclear complex. Meanwhile, the agreement allows -- but doesn’t mandate -- training for Iran in protecting against threats such as cyber-sabotage. Some see this as ironic because of reports that Obama secretly ordered the Stuxnet computer virus to be launched against Iran to derail its nuclear program. But it’s hard to believe that the U.S. would share its secrets in this realm, and the agreement doesn’t force them to do so. "Do you seriously think that any training we might offer Iran would help them ward off another Stuxnet?" Bunn said. "This is really silly. There are good arguments on both sides about this agreement, but this isn’t one of them." Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. and a career Army officer, agreed that the deal doesn’t prevent the U.S. from attacking Iran using cyber or other means or require the U.S. to develop measures to counter a future cyber attack. "The intent (of the provision) is to make certain that Iran is capable to protect nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and help it prevent sabotage," he said. The administration has been clear about how it interprets this provision. Rubio quizzed Secretary of State John Kerry on this portion of the deal during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing July 23. The exchange occurred one day after Rubio told Fox News that the accord would force the U.S. to defend Iran if Israel or "any other country tries to undermine" Iran’s nuclear facilities. Here is an excerpt: Rubio: "If Israel conducts an airstrike against a physical facility, does this deal, the way I read it, does it require us to help Iran protect and respond to that threat?" Kerry: "No." Rubio: "If Israel conducts a cyber attack against the Iranian nuclear program, are we obligated to help them defend themselves against the Israeli cyberattack?" Kerry: "No, I assure you, that we will be coordinating very, very closely with Israel as we do on every aspect of Israel’s security." Our ruling Trump said that under the Iran deal: "If Israel attacks Iran … we are supposed to be on Iran’s side." The claim rests on an interpretation of a provision that the U.S. and other partners are prepared, "as appropriate," to cooperate with training to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage. But the White House has made it clear that its interpretation of the provision is that it is targeted at terrorists and saboteurs, not Israel or other U.S. allies. If you’re still in doubt, consider that nothing in the provision compels the U.S. to offer any assistance to Iran in the event of a threat to its nuclear program. So we rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e8c5c88b-c27c-46f6-9ea8-1ec6a382101c	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-09-04T13:41:33	2015-09-03	['Iran', 'Israel']
pomt-03370	Miami-Dade has "the nation’s highest-rated tap water."	false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/12/miami-dade-county/miami-dade-has-nations-highest-rated-tap-water/	Miami-Dade has plenty to brag about: stellar beaches, celebrities who live in multimillion dollar mansions, four-star restaurants, the world famous tennis tournament on Key Biscayne and the national basketball champions the Miami Heat. But a county document boasted about something far more ordinary when Mayor Carlos Gimenez released his budget proposal July 9. A budget-in-brief document written by the county’s Office of Management and Budget stated that the county has "the nation’s highest-rated tap water." Do we have some sort of liquid gold pouring out of our faucets that is the envy of other counties nationwide? We went in search of answers to quench our curiosity. Miami-Dade has long promoted tap water First, let’s wade into the surprisingly controversial history of Miami-Dade county government talking up tap water. In 2008, the county landed in hot water after it aired radio ads that boasted its tap water was better than bottled water. Nestle Waters North America, which makes nearly $4 billion a year selling Zephyrhills and other brands, threatened to sue, the Miami Herald wrote. (It never did sue, a county spokeswoman told PolitiFact.) The county continued to promote tap water, including a mock boxing match video between tap water and bottled water, a love song jingle "Miami-Dade tap water your No. 1!" and a video of a young cowboy asking Mom, "Howdy M'am? What do you have on tap?" She replied, "For you partner, I’ve got the original tap." Miami-Dade’s explanation We asked a Miami-Dade county spokeswoman to explain the source of the claim that the county has the "nation’s highest-rated tap water." We sensed some research percolating at Miami-Dade County Hall as spokespersons sent us emails saying we’d get an answer soon. A few hours later, we had a reply: "It’s a scrivener’s error," said Jennifer L. Messemer, a spokeswoman in Miami-Dade’s water and sewer department. Budget director Jennifer Moon told us in an email that "we compile input from the various departments to put in the budget-in-brief. We realized yesterday that we inadvertently left out 'one of' in the statement regarding the highest rated water. We will correct this online and in future prints." (At PolitiFact we give props when someone fesses up to an error, but we continue our fact-check anyway.) The error was in a document written by the budget department, according to Messemer. We did not find the same claim in other water-related documents. The full chapter on the water and sewer department’s budget proposal merely refers to the water as "high-quality drinking water." (It also mentions an upcoming $1.6 billion projected to fix environmental violations from failing wastewater infrastructure.) The annual water quality report states that the water "is delicious and meets and exceeds all local, state and federal guidelines. So drink up with confidence!" The county has received some kudos for water quality. Messemer pointed to a 2008 Forbes.com’s Top 10 list of "Best Cities for Clean Drinking Water." The article, which ranked the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area fourth, was based on a 2007 water quality study compiled by University of Cincinnati researchers. (The report was sponsored by Proctor & Gamble.) We found the most comprehensive water quality comparison in an analysis by the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization that says the federal government’s standards for water quality fall short. The group spent three years analyzing water contaminant data nationwide and found 316 contaminants. The EPA has enforceable standards for less than half of them. Released in 2009, the database evaluated water utilities based on the total number of chemicals detected, the percentage of chemicals found of those tested; and the highest average level for a pollutant relative to legal limits or national averages. The analysis included the most common pollutants such as disinfection byproducts, nitrate and arsenic. The group published a ranking of large cities, and Miami came in 46th place out of 100. (Several other large Florida cities or counties were listed, including Odessa, which is served by the St. Petersburg Water Resources Department, 20th; Pinellas County, 57th; Hillsborough County, 65th and Tampa, 68th.) You can read about government officials pushing back against the report in the Miami Herald. Our ruling A Miami-Dade County budget document claimed that the county has "the nation’s highest-rated tap water." A county spokeswoman said that statement was an error. The water department more typically talks about the "high quality" of the water without making a national comparison. An article in Forbes concluded the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area was fourth in water quality based on a 2007 University of Cincinnati study of 12 contaminants. A more thorough national analysis by the Environmental Working Group ranked Miami-Dade County at 46th in 2009. The claim is wrong, but it isn’t so ridiculous to earn our lowest Pants on Fire rating. We’re still going to end with one more joke and pour a cold bucket of tap water to douse this claim. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09585	Democratic presidents "have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/25/carolyn-maloney/congresswoman-says-democratic-presidents-create-mo/	As the recession continues to inflict economic pain on most Americans, the political battle to frame the debate rages on. In a House floor speech on Jan. 21, 2010, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., held up a chart showing job creation statistics under two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. "This chart goes back to 1992, the year that President [Bill] Clinton was elected," Maloney said. "It shows that during his time there was very robust job creation in the private sector, and then during the Bush years it fell dramatically. This dark line is the job creation, going up during the Clinton years, falling dramatically under the [George W.] Bush administration. It also shows that Democrats have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs." We wondered whether that pattern held true for other presidents as well, or whether Maloney had simply chosen two presidencies that conveniently showed her party in the most favorable light. So we ran the numbers and got some interesting results. We did this by turning to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site, where visitors can customize data tables on national employment statistics. We used the month-by-month totals for nonfarm employment in the United States. (We actually ran the numbers twice -- once using Maloney's cited statistic, private-sector employment, and a second time using the combination of private-sector and government employment. It turned out that the general trends were virtually identical, so we'll be sticking with the statistics on just private-sector employment below.) The BLS data go back to 1939, but since that fell in the middle of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, we skipped forward to Harry Truman and compared him and all of his post-World War II successors. We also did some minor massaging of the numbers in order to make the statistics more comparable. First, we calculated how much the number of jobs rose or fell on each president's watch. Then we divided that result by the number of jobs there were when the president began his first term, in order to get a percentage increase in jobs over that president's tenure. This enabled us to minimize the effect of population growth, which would otherwise credit later presidents with larger employment increases than earlier ones. Next, we divided this job growth percentage by the number of years the president occupied the Oval Office, creating a statistic that calculates percentage job growth per year as president. This allowed us to more fairly compare the job growth rates under, say, Gerald Ford with those of two-termers such as Ronald Reagan and Clinton. Finally, we lumped the Democratic presidents' annual job-growth percentages together and averaged them, and did the same for the Republicans. Because President Barack Obama has served just one year in office -- a length of time that some would consider statistically problematic -- we ran the Democratic numbers both with and without Obama, so that readers could choose their preferred statistic. Before we provide the final totals, let's run down how each president did. Here are the average annual percentage increases in jobs for each postwar president: Harry S. Truman (Democrat): increase of 2.95 percent a year Dwight D. Eisenhower (Republican): increase of 0.50 percent a year John F. Kennedy (Democrat): increase of 2.03 percent a year Lyndon B. Johnson (Democrat): increase of 3.88 percent a year Richard M. Nixon (Republican): increase of 2.16 percent a year Gerald R. Ford (Republican): increase of 0.86 percent a year Jimmy Carter (Democrat): increase of 3.45 percent a year Ronald Reagan (Republican): increase of 2.46 percent a year George H.W. Bush (Republican): increase of 0.40 percent a year Bill Clinton (Democrat): increase of 2.86 percent a year George W. Bush (Republican): increase of 0.01 percent a year Barack Obama (Democrat): decrease of 3.0 percent a year (Can we take time out here to say how surprised we are that Eisenhower, who presided over the "happy" 1950s, managed an anemic half-percent job growth per year, while Jimmy "Malaise" Carter finished second with 3.45 percent annual job growth?) Now for the totals. If you exclude Obama, Democrats averaged 3.03 percent annual job growth, compared to 1.07 percent for Republicans -- a nearly 3-to-1 advantage. If you include Obama, the Democrats still held a significant edge. With Obama included, the Democrats averaged 2.03 annual job growth, compared to the same 1.07 for Republicans -- about twice as high as the GOP. And based on some quick calculations he did, Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said that the U.S. working-age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents, making the Democratic accomplishment even more impressive. So the statistics are clear: Democratic presidents have been more successful at creating jobs. But how much importance should we assign to this fact? We hereby list some caveats that we and several historians we contacted came up with. -- The president actually deserves less credit for the good times -- and less blame for the bad times. It's a truism of politics that when things go well, the president generally gets too much credit, and when things don't go well, the president usually gets too much blame. Shouldn't the Republican Congress of 1995-2001 get a share of the credit for Clinton's robust job growth? Shouldn't the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes. -- Timing can be hugely important. "Statistics about employment growth over presidential terms are dominated by the timing of the business cycle, including Federal Reserve policy, and have no apparent connection to economic policies attributed to the White House, as opposed to Congress," said Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. One example: Clinton had the good fortune to enter office when the economy had just undergone a recession. This relatively low starting point made it easier for him to rack up big gains over eight years. The converse is true for George W. Bush: He took office right as the tech bubble was bursting, meaning that any jobs he added to the nation's total amounted to digging the country out of a jobs hole. -- Outside factors can play a big role. Truman's private-sector employment numbers likely benefited from the post-World War II demobilization of troops. (Private sector jobs grew at 2.95 percent per year during his presidency, compared to 2.7 percent a year for all jobs.) Meanwhile, Lyndon Johnson took office right as the first wave of baby boomers was turning 18, a fact that almost certainly boosted his job-creation figures. And research by James D. Hamilton, an economist at the University of California at San Diego has shown that oil price shocks -- something entirely out of a president's control -- have caused most postwar recessions. As Yale political scientist David Mayhew points out, conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set -- in this case, just 12 postwar presidencies -- need to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, most experts we spoke to agreed that the pattern is too consistent to dismiss out of hand. And it's not the only one that reflects a strong correlation between an economic factor and the president's partisan affiliation. In his 2008 book Unequal Democracy, Princeton University political scientist Larry Bartels showed that changes in income inequality are strongly correlated with the president's party. Under every postwar Republican president, Bartels concluded, the gap between rich and poor has grown, and under every Democratic president except for Carter, that gap has shrunk. (For those on the lookout for ideological bias, Bartels made a point of writing in his introduction that he is "an unusually apolitical political scientist" who last voted in 1984, for Reagan. "I was quite surprised to discover how often and how profoundly partisan differences in ideologies and values have shaped key policy decisions and economic outcomes," he wrote. "I have done my best to follow my evidence where it led me.") Ultimately, the experts we contacted said that, despite the caveats, Maloney's calculations, and our expansion of them, were justified. "This is a reasonable exercise in the scheme of things," said liberal economist Dean Baker. "Obviously, luck matters a lot, but when there is a consistent pattern over more than 60 years, it starts to look like more than just luck." Kevin Hassett, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former economic adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, argued that the best way to evaluate presidents is to look at their policies. Still, he added, calculations like Maloney's "are worth doing. They can be thought-provoking and can ignite debates that help inform." So the significance of this pattern is open to question, but on the facts, the evidence is clear: We rate Maloney's statement True, not just for the two presidents she cited, but for the postwar presidency as a whole.

pomt-14819	Says crime statistics show blacks kill 81 percent of white homicide victims.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/	A day after a black activist was kicked and punched by voters at a Donald Trump rally in Alabama, Trump tweeted an image packed with racially loaded and incorrect murder statistics. The image shows a masked, dark-skinned man with a handgun and a set of points, ostensibly about deaths in 2015: "Blacks killed by whites -- 2%" "Blacks killed by police -- 1%" "Whites killed by police -- 3%" "Whites killed by whites -- 16%" "Whites killed by blacks -- 81%" "Blacks killed by blacks -- 97%’ The image cites the "Crime Statistics Bureau - San Francisco" Here is the image: None of the numbers are supported by official sources. The figures on black-on-white homicides and white-on-white homicides are wildly inaccurate. And, as several news organizations quickly noted, the "Crime Statistics Bureau" doesn’t exist. We looked for that agency as well and the closest we found in San Francisco were a number of crime scene clean-up services. Interracial homicides While the image references 2015, the year is not over, and no official numbers have been released. The latest data comes from the FBI for 2014. This table contrasts Trump’s figures with the official ones. Trump Number FBI Number Error factor Blacks killed by whites 2% 8% 4 times Blacks killed by blacks 97% 90% Just a little off Whites killed by whites 16% 82% 5.4 times Whites killed by blacks 81% 15% 5.4 times The most glaring inaccuracies have to do with white homicide victims. Trump cast blacks as the primary killers of whites, but the exact opposite is true. By overwhelming percentages, whites tend to kill other whites. Similarly, blacks tend to kill other blacks. These trends have been observed for decades. Killings by police We also looked at what percentage of each race the police have killed. The official tally of deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers is well known to be incomplete. A study this year by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that official counts miss between 30 to 40 percent of all police-related deaths. The Washington Post has worked to fill the gap by compiling a database of police shootings for 2015. The most recent figures from the Post show 414 whites killed, compared to 223 blacks, as of Nov. 23, 2015. Trump’s tweet said police were responsible for 3 percent of all white homicides and 1 percent of all black homicides. If that were true, then applying those percentages to the FBI report of all homicides in 2014, 91 whites would have died at the hands of police and 25 blacks. That’s a ratio of nearly 4-to-1. In contrast, the Washington Post data show slightly less than two white deaths for each black death. One of the official, and incomplete, sources for people killed at the hands of police is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention violent death database. It shows a ratio of about 1.5 white deaths for each black death, in the period 2009 to 2013. Trump’s number is about double the most accurate figures we could find. That makes him about 100 percent off. Parenthetically, the website Little Green Footballs traced the original image back to a Twitter stream that appears to originate in the United Kingdom and features a modified swatiska with the line "Should have listened to the Austrian chap with the little moustache." Our ruling Trump tweeted an image that made various statistical claims, including that blacks kill 81 percent of white homicide victims. Almost every number in the image is wrong. The statistics on white victims are exaggerated five-fold. The police-related deaths are off as well. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09141	"Bill White has a long history of trying to limit or even disenfranchise military voters."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/14/republican-party-texas/gop-says-bill-white-has-history-trying-restrict-mi/	Celebrating Memorial Day weekend in fine campaign fashion, Gov. Rick Perry released a statement from Bosnian war hero Scott O'Grady, who called on Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White to apologize for undermining military voting rights. O'Grady, a U.S. Air Force captain, gained fame in 1995 after he was shot down in Bosnia and survived for six days before being saved by Marines. "As Memorial Day weekend begins, Bill White should apologize to all veterans and military men and women for supporting limited voting rights for our military," O'Grady said in a press release posted May 28 on Perry's campaign website. The same charge surfaced in 2003, when White was running for mayor of Houston. This time around, it didn't take long for other Republicans to echo O'Grady, including the Republican Party of Texas. "Former Texas Democratic Party chairman and current Democratic nominee for governor, Bill White, has a long history of trying to limit or even disenfranchise military voters," the GOP said in a June 4 e-mail. "His history goes back to at least 1997, when the Democrats tried to overturn elections in South Texas when their candidate lost — and they tried to get military votes thrown out so they could get the outcome that they wanted. It was a purely political attack on military voting rights." Let's roll back a decade. On Nov. 5, 1996, Republican D'Wayne Jernigan beat Democrat Oscar Gonzalez, Jr. by 267 votes to become the Val Verde County sheriff. Republican Murry Kachel bested Frank Coronado by 113 votes for a commissioner's seat in the South Texas county, which was 70 percent Hispanic, according to the 1990 U.S. Census (according to the 2000 U.S. Census, 78 percent of residents were of Hispanic or Latino origin). Almost all of the 800 absentee ballots were cast by mail by military members and their families — most of them Anglo — who had been stationed at Laughlin Air Force Base, near Del Rio, but no longer lived in the county. They swung the election for the GOP. Before the election, Jernigan and Kachel had solicited the votes of members of the military, according to a June 15, 1997, article in the San Antonio Express-News. On Dec. 4, 1996, Gonzalez and Coronado contested the election results, arguing that they lost because of ballots cast by voters who weren't connected to the community. On Dec. 19, county resident Jovita Casarez filed a federal lawsuit with the help of Texas Rural Legal Aid, on the grounds that the absentee ballots improperly diluted the Hispanic vote, violating the Voting Rights Act. The nonprofit group had found that 203 absentee voters in the 1996 election had last resided in the county more than 10 years before. One absentee voter had last voted there in 1986 and also owned a home in Florida. Another military voter indicated in his questionnaire that he and his spouse lived in Bexar County and had only spent their honeymoon in the county 26 years earlier. Two of the voters — Carol and Kenneth Belongia of Colorado Springs, Colo. — listed their former Laughlin address as their residence for voting purposes, and maintained Texas driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, according to a February 1997 report by The Associated Press. "We are legally allowed to do this," Carol Belongia said. "It's kind of tough being in the military... One of the few benefits is we can maintain our state residency like that, to give us a sense of permanence." A federal district judge issued an order blocking Jernigan and Kachel from taking office, pending the Democratic candidates' challenge in state court. The crux of both cases? Whether those service members who cast votes in local elections via Federal Post Card Application ballots satisfied state and federal residency requirements. The federal form lets members of the military and citizens temporarily living abroad to request absentee ballots and to register to vote in local, state and federal elections in one fell swoop. Both suits cited a state law permitting out-of-state voters to cast ballots from elsewhere only if they consider the Texas locale their permanent home or intend to make it so. The federal judge wrote that the issue was not whether U.S. military personnel can vote but where they can legally vote in local elections. The suits spurred accusations that the plaintiffs were attacking military members' and their families' right to vote. Then it got even more contentious. In early 1997, allegations surfaced that Kachel, the county commissioner-elect, was a high-ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan while serving in the military in Germany in the 1980s. The charges traced to a 1981 article in a West German magazine that included a detailed description of Kachel and his living quarters, identifying him as a "European Klan boss." Kachel first denied the charge, then admitted it was true and withdrew his candidacy. Cue White, who was then chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. At a March rally, White said "the Democratic Party of Texas and all Texans support the lawful rights of military voters," according to a March 7, 1997, article in the San Antonio Express-News. "The issue that has been raised here in Val Verde County is not whether people are pro-military or anti-military. It is the rights of local voters to have their say in the process about who represents them," he said. According to the news report, White said the Democratic Party didn't take issue with absentee ballots cast by folks with direct ties to the community or who planned on returning there to retire. "The issue is those people who were born, raised and educated (elsewhere), and have all their ties to other communities, and have not been here for years, and have no vested interest in what happens in local government," he said. In a March 12, 1997, commentary published in the Express-News, White wrote: "The Texas Democratic Party strongly supports the rights of military personnel to participate in the elections of Texas." His column suggested that military personnel who voted for Kachel did so without knowing about his KKK background. White said Kachel's admission of such activities "demonstrates that military voters supported a candidate that they knew little or nothing about, in an election so far from home that they could not possibly have been informed about local concerns." White also suggests that the members of the military were solicited to vote in the Texas county to defeat Democratic candidates, and he wrote that military voters have a financial incentive to declare Texas as their residence because the state doesn't levy an income tax. Why did White wade into the election scuffle? "Because there was a former KKK member who won an election in a largely Hispanic district where (there was) an unusual spike in voting that indicated that there could be some fraud involved," he told us. "But never, ever in the statement I made at the time and in the editorial following that letter to the editor did I think we should restrict the rights of the military to vote." On June 19, 1997, a state district judge ruled that the Democratic candidates failed to make a case in challenging the mail-in ballots, and the federal judge subsequently lifted his injunction blocking Jernigan from taking office. Jernigan was sworn in, nearly eight months after the election. End of story? Not quite. In April 1997, the Texas House voted to approve an amendment by Rep. Hugo Berlanga, D-Corpus Christi, intended to prevent military personnel from voting in local elections unless they had local addresses in the county where they were voting. The amendment did a few things, but at issue here was that made it so that military personnel could only use the federal postcard application to request absentee ballots for federal elections. If they wanted to vote in state or local elections, they needed to register with that county and provide the address of the legal residence in the area they intended to return to. Berlanga insisted the legislation didn't limit military voting rights, but rather protected the rights of all Texas voters. Critics argued that it did exactly that by restricting the scope of the federal postcard application. The amendment later died in the Senate. White defended the amendment, according to a May 4 news article in the Abilene Reporter-News. "It really just simplifies voting for military personnel," he said. "All a member of the military has to do to maintain his or her voting registration in Texas is contact the Secretary of State to register and continue to vote in their home county." Currently? A person is permitted to vote in the "last real home you had in the U.S. and is referred to by election officials as your voting residence address," according to the Texas Secretary of State. You don't have to own or live in the property, but it should be your last U.S. address — not including places where you live temporarily. Where does that leave the GOP's charge that White tried to limit or disenfranchise military voters? In 1997, White supported two lawsuits that sought to throw out hundreds of absentee ballots cast by military members in a South Texas election on grounds that the voters didn't meet residency requirements, and that their votes violated the Voting Rights Act. At the same time, White also favored a legislative proposal that could have made it harder for military personnel to vote in state and local elections in Texas. Why? For each state or local election back home, the affected voter would have to demonstrate they had a local address in the Texas community, register to vote there, and then request the appropriate absentee ballot. Did White's positions — which he hasn't backed off — equate to limiting the right of military personnel to vote? Well, he'd certainly make it harder for those personnel wanting to vote in state and local elections with the same ease some exploited to cast ballots in the Val Verde County election of 1996. However, the 1997 lawsuits and a moment of legislative action in the wake of one election does not a long history make. The Republicans' statement leaves the impression White has been working steadily to restrict military voting rights for decades. We rate the statement as Half True.

pomt-12439	Says the Florida House of Representatives allocated $24 billion, "the greatest investment in education in Florida history!"	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/may/15/richard-corcoran/corcoran-touts-level-education-spending-there/	Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran defended a controversial education bill by saying the Legislature had never spent more on the state’s children. Both educators and lawmakers have criticized the Legislature for approving only a meager increase for K-12 spending in the 2017 legislative session. But as this year’s overtime session wound down, Corcoran touted the overall level of spending the Legislature approved for schools in a May 6, 2017, tweet: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That $24 billion is for all education spending that isn’t for colleges and universities, but also includes $419 million in HB 7069. That 278-page bill was negotiated behind closed doors in Tallahassee near the end of this year’s budgeting process. It covers everything from virtual learning to testing reforms to teacher bonuses. One of the most contested components is $140 million for the "schools of hope" program, largely to attract privately managed charter schools to compete with near-failing schools in poor neighborhoods. Given the heated debate on school funding, we wondered whether the 2017-18 state budget really contained "the greatest investment in education in Florida history," or if there’s more to the balance sheet we should consider. A marginal increase in base funding As a quick overview, the most common measure of education spending is the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), the main source of dollars for K-12 education. When most people discuss K-12 school funding, this is what they are talking about. By law, it’s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the "required local effort," in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars. For 2017-18, the Legislature increased the base education budget, or FEFP, from about $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion. In the current school year, spending is about $7,196 per pupil. The 2017-18 budget raises that to about $7,221 per student, a 0.34 percent increase. The small change has drawn jeers from educators and parents, and is $200 less than the $7,421 amount Gov. Rick Scott requested in his proposed budget. Corcoran is talking about more than the FEFP to reach his total. Getting to $24 billion His $24 billion figure includes several allocations for multiple programs outside the FEFP, and technically is the total for voluntary pre-kindergarten, as well as other programs including mentoring services and grants. We requested analyses from both the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, and they came up with roughly the same figures: The entire education budget for the next fiscal year — including the FEFP, grants, special programs and more — is about $14.7 billion in state funds (including $3.2 billion from state trust funds), plus another $9 billion from the required local effort. That’s a total of $23.7 billion, give or take a few estimated millions. When you add HB 7069’s $419 million to that, you get about $24 billion. Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said that $24 billion outstripped all education funding from prior years, topping the current fiscal year’s $23.4 billion. He sent us a list of 10 years’ worth of spending, but would not specify what programs his office was counting when they compiled the figures. But that’s okay, because we don’t need to look at every program. Even with its tiny increase for next year, the FEFP is slated to be the highest it’s ever been. It’s been on the rise the last few years, after Scott cut education spending when he took office after the 2008 recession. Fiscal year Total K-12 budget Per-pupil spending K-12 enrollment 2007-08 $18.7 billion $7,126 2.63 million 2008-09 $17.9 billion $6,846 2.62 million 2009-10* $18 billion $6,846 2.63 million 2010-11* $18.2 billion $6,897 2.64 million 2011-12 $16.6 billion $6,217 2.67 million 2012-13 $17.2 billion $6,376 2.70 million 2013-14 $18.3 billion $6,769 2.705 million 2014-15 $18.9 billion $6,915 2.74 million 2015-16 $19.7 billion $7,105 2.77 million 2016-17 $20.2 billion $7,196 2.8 million 2017-18 $20.4 billion $7,221 2.83 million *Includes federal stimulus money Now for the caveats. First of all, one would expect the FEFP to go up a bit each year, because generally the total number of students in Florida schools continues to increase. For 2017-18, the state projects an increase of about 300,000 students. That means despite a small funding increase, many school districts will actually see total allocations drop. Furthermore, Florida’s per-pupil spending lags far behind the national average of about $10,700 (a total that has been dropping in recent years). And even then, the per-pupil amount is less than $100 more than what it was a decade ago, and certainly has not kept up with inflation. Per-pupil spending would have to be roughly $8,358 next fiscal year to simply equal the 2007-08 level, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We also must note that unlike FEFP money, HB 7069’s cash is going to very targeted programs, like scholarships for disabled youth (initiated by former Senate President Andy Gardiner), Best and Brightest scholarships for teachers, and incentives for charter schools. That money also isn’t guaranteed, because Scott has to sign it first. School officials across the state, from Miami-Dade to Polk County and beyond, have called for Scott to veto the bill because they say it doesn’t adequately address their needs. Our ruling Corcoran tweeted that at $24 billion, the House has made "the greatest investment in education in Florida history!" In sheer dollars, that appears to be the case in large part because the Legislature agreed to an incremental bump in funding. Even if Scott doesn’t sign HB 7069, which targets very specific programs, the main state-local funding source alone is still at the highest total it’s ever been. But it's not a runaway difference. Compared with the current year, the per-pupil increase is less than one-half of 1 percent. The increases that do exist won't affect every school district equally, and some counties likely will see less money because of how the state allocates school funds. Corcoran is also including spending that hasn't yet been approved by the governor. The claim loses even more luster when taking into account that Florida's education spending, already lower than the national average, hasn’t kept up with inflation for years. The next fiscal year is no different. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-11037	"Maxine Waters Is Getting Criminally Charged!"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/29/blog-posting/loomer-maxine-waters-not-facing-criminal-charges/	Is U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., getting criminally charged? Waters’ call to confront members of President Donald Trump’s administration during a June 23 rally in Los Angeles not only drew criticism, but sparked a series of inaccurate headlines and stories. "Maxine Waters Is Getting Criminally Charged!," read a headline on ConservativePost.com. Like the claim that a Trump supporter had tried to murder Waters, this headline is false. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Laura Loomer, a conservative investigative journalist, is charging ‘Auntie’ Maxine for assault, citing Waters hit her hand and swatted her face with office papers," the article reads. The blog post cites a tweet by Loomer that reads: "BREAKING: Today I filed a police report w/ @CapitolPolice against @RepMaxineWaters. Yesterday when I confronted her on Capitol Hill, she ASSAULTED me. She hit my hand, then she swatted me in the face twice w/ her papers. I’m pressing charges against her." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A video Loomer posted of the incident shows Loomer chasing after Waters in the halls of Congress. Waters responds each question by saying a variation of, "Come to my office, I’ll be happy to sit down with you. We can’t talk on the run." When Loomer does not desist, Waters holds a piece of paper over her face and waves Loomer’s recording device away. Waters eventually walks into a members-only elevator on her way to a vote. Filing a police report does not equate having criminal charges brought against Waters. A criminal charge can only be made by a government authority, which Loomer is not. "A police report could trigger a criminal charge if a prosecutor brought the charges to a grand jury and they chose to pursue it," Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University, told us. "But the mere filing of a complaint by an individual who feels aggrieved does not constitute a criminal charge." Bloggers said Waters is getting criminally charged. But that’s a misreading of what happened, and how the U.S. criminal justice system works. We rate this statement False.

pomt-04862	The property appraiser's budget "is $1 million less today than when I took office 16 years ago."	true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/10/rob-turner/rob-turner-says-property-appraisers-budget-1-milli/	Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Rob Turner was cruising toward re-election with nothing remarkable to taint his 16-year tenure -- until a former human resources director filed a discrimination claim against him for sending her pornographic emails, that is. Turner fired her, and the incident drew calls for him to resign, as well as a challenge in the Republican primary from state Sen. Ronda Storms. Turner’s main defense in this contest is that he’s good at his job and has saved taxpayers money. "Our budget is $1 million less today than when I took office 16 years ago," he wrote in answers to questions from the Tampa Bay Times. Given the rate of inflation and the vast expansion in property development in Hillsborough since 1996, we wondered if that could possibly be true. The office Turner, who defeated Democrat Ron Alderman in 1996, hasn’t made many waves since taking office, which assigns values to the county’s properties so that local governments can assess how much their owners should pay in taxes each year. Despite Alderman’s reputation for alleged cronyism and visiting bars during work hours, Turner’s reputation was for reducing his workforce and keeping spending levels reasonable. Among the changes in the office in the last 16 years are updating administrative services, purchasing technology that allows workers to perform appraisals with fewer staff, reducing the office’s vehicle fleet from 72 vehicles to 40 and a steady reduction in full-time employees from 178 in 1996 to 130 today. The key claim here, however, is the annual budget. Here’s how the process works: The appraiser’s office proposes a budget each year and submits it to the state Department of Revenue. The department applies a nonpolitical cost analysis to those numbers, and then usually approves a little more or a little less than what is requested, a difference that may be as negligible as a few hundred dollars. The department then tells the county tax collector how much money to disburse from ad valorem taxes. The county commission is notified, but it doesn’t get a say in the budget. The budget numbers The first budget Turner was responsible for was for the 1997-98 fiscal year, totalling $11.8 million. Over the years, Turner gradually reduced staff, resulting in the current workforce of 130. He says with pride that none of those positions were lost due to layoffs, and his office confirmed the staff reductions were achieved through retirements, voluntary resignations and employees changing jobs. This budget dipped slightly the first few years, reaching a low of $8.9 million for 2000-01. The budget then increased steadily for several years, reaching a peak of $13.1 million in 2008-2009. This is for reasons ranging from computer upgrades to salary raises to the real estate boom, which disproportionately affected Florida as a whole. During this time, the number of parcels requiring appraisal in Hillsborough County went from about 380,000 in 1999 to more than 525,000, the office says. The budget then began a steady decline, due to staff departures, a four-year wage freeze and the onset of the Great Recession, which brought a decrease in property values -- and ad valorem taxes along with it. The following fiscal year, 2009-10, the budget was $12.45 million. In 2010-11, it was $11.6 million. Last year it was $11 million. During every year we examined, the amount of actual expenditures never exceeded the office’s approved budget. The 2012-13 budget for Turner’s office is yet again lower, with the state approving expenditures of $10.7 million. This is the basis for Turner’s claim of his budget being $1 million less than when he took office. The difference between his first approved budget for 1997-98 and the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in October, is $1,079,585, to be exact. This is a drop of about 9 percent since 1996. Turner leaves out the fact that his office’s budget swelled along with the housing boom before deflating with the recent recession. But given the boom and bust in property values, the increase in the number of assessed properties, and inflation, this is not an unreasonable fluctuation, especially considering the peak in 2008-09 was only 10.5 percent higher than when he took office in 1996. Since that peak, the budget decreased $2.3 million. The ruling Despite the distractions, Turner is running on his record of being able to perform his duties for four consecutive terms. Among his most salient qualifications, he says, is that his office cut $1 million from the budget compared to 16 years ago. The numbers show the office’s budget did increase steadily through Florida’s boom years, but only by a relatively small amount. Its annual spending plan is now smaller than when Turner took office in 1996 -- by $1,079,585. We rate this claim True.	None	Rob Turner	None	None	None	2012-08-10T11:32:25	2012-07-18	['None']

It cuts to a clip of Obama speaking on March 14, 2008, saying, "We're going to work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year." When the Obama clip ends, the following text appears on the screen: "Reality: The president's health care plan raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family." We wondered if the charge was accurate. The Senate Republican Conference didn't provide information to support the claim by our deadline. The video’s claim is similar to a claim we looked at in December 2009. Back then, we checked the claim by Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. Pence said that under the Democratic health plan -- which was then in the final stages leading up to passage -- families "will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care." As we noted then, the figure comes from a Nov. 30, 2009, analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The CBO's analysis of how the law would affect premiums was broken into three categories, based on expectations for the year 2016: • Those in the small group market, or people who work for businesses with up to 50 employees and receive employer-provided coverage. This category would make up about 13 percent of the total insurance market by 2016, CBO found. • Those in the large group market, which would account for about 70 percent of the insurance market. • Those in the non-group (or "individual") market, who purchase insurance as individuals. This group is expected to grow to about 17 percent of the insurance market. Today, these individuals purchase plans on their own, but most purchases made after the health care law is fully in place in 2014 would be made through the newly created insurance "exchanges" -- virtual marketplaces where Americans without employer-sponsored coverage can browse through insurance offerings and choose which plan to buy. According to the report, the CBO estimates that the average premium per person in new individual policies would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium for individual coverage under current law. Specifically, the average premiums per policy in the non-employer-provided market in 2016 would be roughly $5,800 for single policies (up from $5,500 under current law) and $15,200 for family policies (up from $13,100 under current law). The latter comparison, for families, is the source of the Senate Republican Conference’s number (and Pence’s) -- $2,100. So the web video is correct that for families with non-group coverage, premiums could rise by $2,100. But the video also leaves out some important context. It ignores subsidies that many purchasers will receive. The CBO report notes that the majority of non-group enrollees -- about 57 percent -- would receive federal insurance subsidies, which on average would cover about two-thirds of the total premium. It ignores improvements in the plan for beneficiaries. Much of the coverage purchased on the individual market prior to the law included high deductibles and restrictions. But the plans to be sold on the exchanges will be required to offer a minimum benefit package that should, in most cases, be superior what was offered in policies sold before the law took effect. So while the new coverage may cost more, beneficiaries will get more insurance for their money and should see their out-of-pocket medical costs go down. According to the CBO report, an "apples to apples" comparison of the average price of equivalent insurance under the Democrats' plan would translate to an average premium about 7 to 10 percent lower than under current law. Using the individual market as the standard is cherry picking. The other two categories -- the small group and large-group markets -- are entirely ignored by the video, even though the vast majority of people -- 83 percent -- get private health care insurance that way. And the impact of the law on premiums for these groups is far lower than for the individual market. CBO projected that small-group premiums would jump just $100 by 2016, while large-group premiums would jump by just $200. Neither figure is as eye-popping as the $2,100 figure cited in the video. Put it all together and what the CBO actually projected is that the vast majority of families with private insurance would see little change in premiums -- some because they’ll have employer-sponsored insurance that won’t experience big premium hikes, and some because they’ll have federally subsidized coverage in the individual market. The families at risk of having to pay $1,200 in extra premiums would be those who have individual market insurance in 2016 but no subsidies -- about 7 percent of all Americans who have either individual or employer-sponsored insurance. Using statistics for the individual market is a non-sequitur. The video airs a clip of Obama promising to "work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year." As we recently noted, we’ve given Obama a rating of Stalled for his promise to lower employer-provided family premiums by $2,500, so noting that failure is a legitimate point. But video goes on to note that Obama law "raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family." The individual market is the only type of private insurance where the employer plays no role. Our ruling The Senate Republican Conference video claimed that while Obama promised to "work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year," his health care law "raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family." The number does come from a Congressional Budget Office analysis, and it’s phrased accurately. But it’s stripped of crucial context and distorts the truth. It ignores subsidies that would ease the financial burden for a majority of those seeing premium increases; it ignores that the additional premium dollars will pay for more generous benefits; and it ignores that the vast majority of Americans with private insurance will pay no more than $200 extra for their premiums due to the law -- and possibly less than that.

pomt-13690	Barack Obama "ended up getting re-elected by the largest gender gap in the history of American elections."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/jul/29/cecile-richards/cecile-richards-makes-half-true-claim-about-barack/	Texas-born Cecile Richards enjoyed sitting next to President Bill Clinton in the crowd on the scene watching the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. "How awesome is that," Richards said to Texas delegates at a hotel breakfast the next morning. The eldest daughter of the late Gov. Ann Richards drew our attention with a declaration about women making history compared with men in their relative support for Barack Obama four years ago. Richards, who leads the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, noted that Obama that fall stressed his support for the women’s health care and abortion provider in debate with Republican Mitt Romney. "Of course, President Obama ended up getting re-elected by the largest gender gap ever in the history of American elections. And we’re going to do even better this time," she said. We don’t check predictions. But we were curious if Obama enjoyed the biggest "gender gap" in presidential election history. We tried to ask Richards how she reached her conclusion and didn’t draw a response. Gallup's analysis Separately, we reached out to Celinda Lake, a Democratic strategist and pollster; her office sent an email pointing out a November 2012 Gallup press release stating that Obama "won the two-party vote among female voters in the 2012 election by 12 points, 56 percent to 44 percent, over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Meanwhile, Romney won among men by an eight-point margin, 54% to 46%." The release continued: "That total 20-point gender gap is the largest Gallup has measured in a presidential election since it began compiling the vote by major subgroups in 1952," the release said. The second-largest gap in the period, of 18 percentage points, traces to the 1984 election won by Ronald Reagan, Gallup said. A footnote to Gallup’s chart (below) says the gap was calculated according to results of Gallup polls taken just before each election indicating how well each Democratic presidential nominee was preferred by women against how poorly the Democrat polled among men. SOURCE: Press release, "Gender Gap in 2012 Vote Is Largest in Gallup's History," Gallup, Nov. 9, 2012 Better ways to gauge? Separately to our inquiries, polling experts told us other ways of measuring the gender gap among voters in presidential elections are more widely accepted. By email, Susan Carroll, a senior scholar at the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University, commented: "Gallup and others make the calculation needlessly complicated by combining figures for both candidates." By email, Daron Shaw of the University of Texas called Gallup’s calculation "a particular (contentious) stat from one organization that is NOT corroborated by any other groups." Debbie Walsh, the center’s director, pointed us to a 2012 center "fact sheet" presenting the gender gap as measured by voter exit polls in each presidential election from 1980 through 2012. By phone, she said Richards might prove right about the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, potentially winning with the biggest gender gap ever. But, Walsh said, she doesn’t think Richards was right about Obama’s 2012 gap. The center’s sheet says: "A gender gap in voting refers to a difference between the percentage of women and the percentage of men voting for a given candidate, generally the winning candidate. Even when men and women favor the same candidate, they may do so by different margins, resulting in a gender gap." The presentation continues: "In every election since 1980, a gender gap has been apparent, with a greater proportion of women than men preferring the Democrat in each case." And in 2012, according to the sheet, 55 percent of women and 45 percent of men favored Obama, making for a gender gap of 10 percentage points. But that wasn’t the biggest gender gap over the nine analyzed elections. In 1996, President Bill Clinton experienced an 11 percentage point gender gap, winning re-election with 54 percent of women favoring him compared with 43 percent of men, according to the Voter News Service. In 2000, according to the service, ultimately victorious Republican George W. Bush won the support of 53 percent of men compared with 43 percent of women, leaving a gender gap of 10 percentage points--meaning, Walsh told us, women were 10 percentage points less likely than men to vote for him. Al Gore drew votes from 54 percent of women, according to the service, and 42 percent of men. Other victors for president, according to the sheet, prevailed with gender gaps ranging from four percentage points (Clinton in 1992) to eight points (Ronald Reagan in 1980). Shaw further urged us to consider a 2006 research paper, "The Gender Gap," by researcher Karen M. Kaufmann. Kaufmann’s paper defines "gender gap" by focusing on how the Democratic nominee, win or lose, polls among women and men. The paper says: "While there are a number of ways to measure the gender gap, the most common measure subtracts the percentage of men who identify with the Democratic Party from the percentage of Democratic women." We ran this focus past other experts including Walsh, who said her approach is the preferred way to measure the gap, and Jim Henson, who with Shaw co-directs the University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll; Henson said by email he thinks Kaufmann’s definition is more commonly used. For her part, Kaufmann, a visiting lecturer at UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Policy, said by email that while there’s a "weak consensus" among experts about how to measure the gender gap, the "reason the Democratic gap is typically the standard, is that it was male movement away from the Democratic Party that created the gap initially and the fluctuation in the gap is typically reflected in the movement of white men to and from Democratic candidates." According to the paper, the alignment of more women with the Democratic Party started with the election of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964--with the gap growing over time, in great part due to white men aligning more with the Republican Party. "Men are more conservative than women across a number of important political domains," Kaufmann wrote. She also said: "Beyond the significance of attitudes, research also suggests that, at times, men and women attach varying levels of priority to certain political issues," with those decisions widening or narrowing the gender gap. Kaufmann found the gender gap among Southern women diminishing through the elections of 1996 through 2004 with the gap in the rest of the country staying relatively constant, per data from the American National Election Studies, a project overseen by researchers at the University of Michigan and Stanford University that has surveyed people about voting after every presidential election since 194852. The paper came out, of course, before Obama won for president. So, it doesn’t precisely extend to what we’re checking. Post-election poll results since 1948 So, we reached out to the ANES for relevant results and Patricia Luevano emailed us its breakout suggesting that in each of the 13 elections from 1964 through 2012, more women than men reported having voted for the Democratic nominee. Over those elections, the breakout indicates, the widest gender gap--again, the difference between the shares of women versus men who reported voting for the Democrat--opened up in 1996 when 60 percent of women recalled voting for Clinton compared to 46 percent of men. The second-widest gap, nine percentage points, occurred in 1992 (Clinton) and 2000 (Al Gore), according to the breakout. According to the breakout, Obama’s gender gap of 2012 was six percentage points; 55 percent of women said they’d voted for him compared to 49 percent of men. That gap trailed the gaps indicated by the project’s results for 1984 and 2004 (eight percentage points each) and 1988 (seven percentage points), in the end tying for fifth among the 13 elections with six-point gaps in 1972 and 1980. Luevano also shared a breakout showing the gender gap for each winner of the presidency from 1948 on--and indicating three elections in which the winner had a bigger gender gap than what the project found for Obama in 2012: Clinton in 1996 (14 percentage points); Clinton in 1992 (10 points); and Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 (seven points; as with Clinton and Obama, that much of a greater share of women reported voting for him than men). Our ruling Richards said that Obama in 2012 "ended up getting re-elected by the largest gender gap in the history of American elections." Such data doesn’t appear to be available for all presidential elections. Otherwise, Gallup’s unusual approach to calculating the gender gap for Democratic presidential nominees places Obama No. 1 since 1952 with a 14-point gap in 2012. But other reasonable methodologies show that since 1948, other candidates and victors (even Ike) had greater gender gaps. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12762	"Over 200 of our 520 school districts did not have a single student in physics."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/feb/24/eric-greitens/greitens-overstates-number-students-not-enrolled-p/	At this year’s State of the State Address, newly elected Gov. Eric Greitens discussed problems with the Missouri education system and why he believes Missouri schools rank last in almost every area. Greitens, a Republican, offered some interesting statistics about how so few students are enrolled in certain math and science courses. His statement about physics enrollment stood out. "What we need to do is make sure that the money we spend finds its way into the classroom," Greitens said. "Over half of Missouri school districts do not offer a single Advanced Placement class. Over 200 of our 520 school districts did not have a single student in physics. Over 100 did not have a single student enrolled in chemistry. "We need to expand course access programs, so that every child in Missouri can use technology to get the education they need." The governor’s claim about enrollment numbers for Missouri high school students in physics courses seemed a bit low. So we wondered, is this really the case? And if so, why do so few Missouri school districts offer physics? What the numbers show Greitens spokesman Parker Briden said the office pulled data from a report compiled by a think tank called the Show-Me Institute. The report, which focused on course access in Missouri, requested information from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education on enrollment of various courses offered in public schools. The report said that, "During the 2014-2015 school year, of the 507 school districts that offer high school in the state ... 213 districts had no students enrolled in physics." However, PolitiFact Missouri called into question these numbers, and on Feb. 8, the Show-Me Institute issued a correction to its data. According to the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, there are 448 school districts offering high school courses in Missouri — not the 507 that the Show-Me Institute had previously stated, or the 520 that Greitens claimed. With the new calculations, the Show-Me Institute found that 154 of those districts — not 213 — had no students enrolled in physics. Why are so few students enrolled? Even after the Show-Me Institute’s correction, the data still showed that a large number of students in Missouri weren’t enrolled in physics during the 2014-2015 school year. However, when the Show-Me Institute crunched its numbers, it only included higher-level courses for each subject. It didn’t take into account the ninth grade course, "Physics First." A TIME for Physics First , a program that was created as part of a grant in 2009, takes a different approach to teaching high school science. Meera Chandrasekhar, a leader of the program team and physics professor at MU, said that Physics First reverses the high school science sequence and allows students to apply the algebra skills they are just learning. "It gets students in ninth grade started off in a really good footing for upper-level science courses because physics is a fundamental science," Chandrasekhar said. How many students really are studying physics? In order to find out how many students are in any physics course in Missouri, we decided to crunch our own numbers independently from the Show-Me Institute. Turns out there was a bit of a difference. When the Show-Me Institute compiled and published its report, it didn’t use finalized numbers for the 2014-2015 school year. The most recent numbers from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education showed that of the 448 school districts offering high school in Missouri, 178 districts did not offer upper-level physics courses. When adding in Physics First, 156 school districts did not offer any physics course. Even though there isn’t a large difference between the two sets of data, 22 of these school districts actually offer Physics First only. Chandrasekhar said that this has to do with requirements for high school teachers. To be able to teach physics at the high school level, a teacher must have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in physics. Physics First, however, is taught as more of an introductory science course and the program offers training for high school science teachers who are qualified in other areas such as biology or chemistry. This is a benefit for more rural schools in Missouri that might not necessarily have the resources to hire a physics teacher since physics is not a required science. "Every child in ninth grade gets to take a physics class then," Chandrasekhar said. "It essentially boosts the numbers." The national picture When Greitens made his claim about physics enrollment, it was part of a much larger claim — that education in Missouri is behind. "We have an education system that ranks near last in every measure that matter," Greitens said. However, when it comes to physics, that’s far from the truth. Paul Cottle, a physics professor at Florida State University, has focused some of his research on physics course access in the United States. As a part of his research, he requested data from every state education department on its physics enrollment numbers. For the 2014-2015 school year, Missouri ranked sixth out of the 29 states from which Cottle received data. Missouri’s physics enrollment numbers were also above 50 percent, compared with the 23 other states, which had enrollment rates below 42 percent. Our ruling Greitens said that over 200 of 520 school districts in Missouri didn’t have any students enrolled in physics. The data that Greitens used for his claim contained incorrect information and didn’t account for students enrolled in the Physics First course. Part of Greitens overall claim was that the Missouri education system ranks nearly last in every category. But when it comes to physics, Missouri has an above-average enrollment rate. We rate this claim as Mostly False.	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2017-02-24T10:33:02	2017-01-17	['None']
pomt-02320	Health insurance and medical costs "are going down because of Obamacare."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/28/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-obamacare-driving-costs-down/	As the country heads into the 2014 election, Republicans are ratcheting up -- to the extent it’s possible -- their attacks on Obamacare. But MSNBC host Ed Schultz is urging Democrats to stand tall. "Democrats need to embrace Obamacare. Don't be afraid to run on it in the midterms," Schultz exhorted. "Don't pay attention to the predictions, pay attention to the results, pay attention to the numbers, explain that in a town hall meeting, and they will be cheering Democrats." Schultz said the facts are clear. Four years after the program began, it is working. "Health insurance costs and medical care costs fell sharply in January, ding, ding, ding," Schultz crowed. "For the first time in decades, we finally have this: Health care costs are going down because of Obamacare." The claim that the Affordable Care Act is reducing health costs been made before. It’s been a year since PolitiFact looked into it so it seemed time for an update. And since Schultz mentioned health insurance and medical costs, we can pull back the curtain a bit on how the government tracks these changes. As Schultz spoke, a large chart behind him showed the declines he was talking about. It showed that by a measure called the price index, insurance prices fell 0.4 percent in January and health services dropped 0.1 percent. Technically, the full name of this yardstick is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, and the first thing to note is that a price index is not the same as the cost. We'll get into that in just a bit. Schultz got those numbers correct (they came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), but the analysts we reached told us you have to be careful focusing on any single month. A broader picture of the insurance price index shows a much bigger decline about a year ago followed by a steep rise. In short, the index fluctuates -- sometimes wildly, said Jim Dolmas, a senior research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who has written articles about price index measurement. "Because these series do jump around, it’s a good idea to never put undue weight on any one month’s observation," Dolmas said. Here’s a look at what Dolmas is talking about. Source: Goldman Sachs and Commerce Department, via Washington Post As you can see, isolating any one month is problematic. But so is using the index to measure health care costs at all, we found. The health services index measures how much providers are paid, which includes what they get from patients and insurance companies. "There are lots of pieces that go into the construction of these, and they don’t always match neatly with what consumers may see out-of-pocket," Dolmas told PunditFact. What other numbers show The fact is, determining the impact of Obamacare on health care costs is difficult, if not impossible, because enough data isn’t available. Some numbers, like the index, suggest a decrease. But others do not. Tim Dall, a health economist at the financial consulting firm IHS, pointed to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that adjusts for seasonal variations. The BLS figures show that overall medical inflation remained at a constant 0.2 percent for December, January and February. "It’s a stretch to say that a blip in January shows that the Affordable Care Act is holding down costs," Dall said. "It should drive down costs in the long term, (but) it will be years before we know the impact on health care use and cost." Jack Rodgers, managing director of the Health Policy Economics Group at PricewaterhouseCoopers, a large accounting and financial consulting firm, confirmed that the price declines are real, but he said that doesn’t mean health costs have also gone down. "Even if the price index reflects the appropriate average price, costs are probably growing," Rodgers said. "Because more people are using services, and those who are using services are using more on average." In fact, total monthly health care spending rose by 1.6 percent in January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Does this mean that the Affordable Care Act has had no effect? No, but teasing out those impacts today has proven difficult. Analysts need to separate Obamacare from the other factors that have been working on the health care industry. The view among most researchers is that the sluggish economy has played the largest role. "About three-quarters of the recent decline in health spending growth can be explained by changes in the broader economy," the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent Washington-based research group, concluded last year. One of the problems in the debate over the effect of the Affordable Care Act is that it takes a while for the data to appear. The latest report on health spending from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services describes what happened through 2012. It found that health care spending rose by 3.7 percent. On the plus side, that was the fourth year in a row that the growth rate stayed low and health care’s share of the economy dropped a hair to 17.2 percent. We should note that health care analysts think the new health care system could reduce costs in the long run. They credit Obamacare with moving hospitals and doctors away from frequent use of expensive specialists and toward a system that rewards improved outcomes at reduced costs. Smaller increases in Medicare payments to providers that are part of the law could be holding prices in check. But the consensus is that more durable proof of the law’s impact is yet to come. Our ruling Schultz said health care costs are going down due to Obamacare. Government data show decreases in January for the price of health insurance and health services. However, those measures can bounce around and if Schultz had looked a few months further back, he would have seen even steeper declines, followed by later increases. Plus, a drop in a price index doesn’t always translate into a lower price for the customer. Most analysts judge health care costs not by prices but overall spending. By that measure, costs continue to rise, albeit slowly. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on containing the cost of health care remains largely unproven. Schultz had some accurate numbers on prices but he was too quick to treat those as changes in costs and the role of the Affordable Care Act is sketchy for the time being. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Ed Schultz	None	None	None	2014-03-28T14:19:34	2014-03-24	['None']

pomt-08371	Says Robert Hurt "supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/25/tom-perriello/perriello-hurt-taxpayer-pledge-loophole-overseas/	Tom Perriello wants to know what Robert Hurt is hiding with his stance on tax loopholes, but the murkiness comes more from a cookie-cutter Democratic ad campaign than the Republican candidate’s position. In a political ad, "What is Robert Hurt Hiding?", Perriello, a Democratic congressman from Charlottesville, claimed that Hurt, his Republican challenger from Chatham, "supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas." The basis of the claim is the Taxpayer Protection Pledge that Hurt signed in December after a much-publicized meeting with Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group in Washington. Hurt is one of seven challengers in Virginia congressional races -- six Republicans and one independent -- to take the pledge, which the anti-tax group enforces strictly. The pledge for House candidates has two parts: They promise to oppose any increase in marginal income tax rates for citizens or businesses, and they vow to oppose the elimination of tax deductions or credits unless they are offset "dollar for dollar" by tax cuts or new credits. Simple enough. But it has given Democrats an opening to make a dubious connection to tax credits they portray as loopholes for shipping American jobs offshore. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has translated the second part of the pledge to mean that signers support tax loopholes for multinational companies operating in other countries. The DCCC backs up the claim not with the pledge the candidates actually signed, but with three specific bills opposed by Americans for Tax Reform that the group urged pledge signers to oppose. One of them was the $26.1 billion bill adopted in August to help states hire teachers and pay for Medicaid services. The money for those programs would come from closing the loopholes. Hurt opposed that bill, citing the increase in federal spending. Democrats say the money from closing the loopholes was well-spent. "Our point is if you’re going to spend the money, it should be on creating jobs here," Jesse F. Ferguson, the DCCC’s southern region press secretary, told us. But the fact that someone signed the pledge doesn’t necessarily mean they are opposed to closing loopholes for off-shore companies. Our friends at FactCheck.org have been knocking down this claim since April, when the DCCC ran a TV ad against a Republican House candidate in Hawaii. They recently debunked the same claim in an ad in the Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign. Here’s the problem: The taxpayer pledge doesn’t prevent a signer from opposing any tax break as long as he or she finds a way to offset the resulting increase in taxes. "The pledge doesn’t get into whether something is good or bad tax policy," Ryan Ellis, ATR’s director of tax policy, told us. The pledge means that if a bill would result in a net tax increase, "you’re not free to vote for it," Ellis said. Hurt hasn’t offered specifics about his position on the offshore tax rules, but in a TV ad last month, he called Perriello’s claim false. We agree. Perriello has chosen to rest his claim on the DCCC’s spurious connection to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, but that is a huge leap of logic and it doesn’t prove Hurt supports the offshore loopholes.

pomt-08808	"We didn’t have a development director for over seven months."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/17/john-kasich/john-kasich-slams-gov-ted-strickland-leaving-job-c/	Ohio Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich has not missed an opportunity to hammer away at the state’s double-digit unemployment rate under Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, often throwing out a huge number for jobs loss since January 2007. But Kasich hasn’t whaled away at just the loss of jobs. He also has chided Strickland for not doing enough to create and bring jobs to Ohio. That duty typically falls to the director of the Ohio Department of Development. In a speech this month at a candidate’s forum, Kasich told a group economic analysts and community planners, "We didn’t have a development director for over seven months." That’s a big statement in a state whose unemployment rate, like much of the rest of the country, has steadily risen in recent years. It’s a statement that can score a lot of points for you on the campaign trail. But could it be true? A look back over the past 18 months may be clarifying. Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher doubled as the state’s development director until February 2009 when Fisher gave up his director duties to focus on his run for the U.S. Senate. Fisher remains the lieutenant governor and is also the Democratic nominee for a senate seat. Fisher helped handpick his successor as development director, Mark Barbash, who Fisher had brought to the agency as its chief economic development officer. Strickland made Barbash the acting director Feb. 17, 2009, the same day Fisher resigned. But three months later, Barbash stepped down after he publicly acknowledged that he owed the Internal Revenue Service more than $146,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties and that he was facing foreclosure on his home. That same day, Strickland replaced Barbash as acting director with Lisa Patt-McDaniel, who was the department’s workforce and talent division director. Strickland did not make her job permanent until September 2009. That means Ohio was without a permanent development director from February to September of last year. But it is not as if no one was in charge and leading the department, the Strickland campaign has argued. By appointing acting directors on the same days that Fisher and later Barbash resigned, the department technically had a director. Still, the tag "acting" or "interim" in front of a title generally means the job isn’t permanently filled. "Interim" is synonymous with temporary. "Acting", the word preferred by the Strickland administration, means temporarily assuming another person’s duties. In this case, Kasich might argue that he is technically correct because the development department had no permanent director for seven months, although there were interim people in charge the entire time. We think a natural impression someone would get from Kasich’s statement is that he was saying the chair was empty -- that Ohio’s job-making agency was without leadership for seven months just as the recession was gobbling up jobs in the Buckeye State at a quickening pace. But we know someone was in charge. That’s why we rate Kasich’s statement as False. Comment on this item.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2010-08-17T12:30:00	2010-08-04	['None']
pomt-01096	Administrative employees at colleges and universities have "more than doubled over the last 25 years, outpacing the growth of students by more than 2 to 1."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-college-administrators-have-more-/	In his new book, American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., offers an aggregation of many of the conservative ideas he’s supported, including education policy. In one passage, Rubio takes aim at the growth in college bureaucracies, which he suggests has gotten in the way of teaching and has led to steep increases in tuition. Rubio says universities should stop hiring bureaucrats. "One study," Rubio writes, "found the number of administrative employees at colleges and universities (think deputy assistant to the associate vice provost and gender equity administrators) has more than doubled over the last 25 years, outpacing the growth of students by more than two to one." We wondered whether Rubio’s claim was correct. We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s staff, but we did find that his book footnoted an article by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, an organization affiliated with Boston University. That article, written by Jon Marcus, was headlined, "New Analysis Shows Problematic Boom In Higher Ed Administrators." It summarized calculations of federal data by the investigative-reporting group along with the American Institutes for Research, an independent social-science research group. The article indicates that Rubio is pretty close to the mark. At one point, Marcus writes that between 1987 and the 2012, "the number of administrators and professional staff has more than doubled. That’s a rate of increase more than twice as fast as the growth in the number of students." That language is very close to what Rubio wrote. We checked with Marcus, and he said Rubio’s characterization is reasonable. Donna M. Desrochers, a researcher at American Institutes for Research, added that in her view, Rubio’s statement is "almost accurate." She said that data from a slightly different time period -- 1990 to 2012 -- showed that the number of professional staff at four-year and two-year institutions rose by 91 percent. That’s almost double, and that came at a time when enrollment rose by 43 percent. So professional staff was growing roughly twice as fast as student enrollment, as Rubio indicated. However, Rubio’s specific examples -- "deputy assistant to the associate vice provost and gender equity administrators" -- don’t bear out his larger point. Executive positions, such as ones with "provost" in the title, have been growing at a significantly slower pace than professional jobs overall. If executive staff growth had been included in the calculations along with professional staff, the rate of increase would have been 76 percent, instead of the 91 percent for professional staff alone, Desrochers said. Indeed, in the most recent period studied -- between 2000 and 2012 -- professional positions grew twice as fast as executive positions. Another point worth noting: Students, rather than existing administrative employees, have been the biggest beneficiaries of staff growth in recent years. According to a report by Desrochers, wage and salary expenditures for student services were the fastest-growing salary expense in many types of institutions between 2002 and 2012. "Many student-related activities (ranging from course and career guidance to disciplinary actions) that were previously under the purview of faculty have been centralized, to free up faculty time and standardize the types and quality of services provided," Desrochers wrote in the report. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing, she says: "Investments that directly support student success are wise if they lead to improved learning and degree outcomes." Our ruling Rubio wrote that college administrators have "more than doubled over the last 25 years, outpacing the growth of students by more than 2 to 1." Rubio’s right about the general trend, but one of the two examples he specifically mentions in the book belongs to a different employment category -- one that has been growing more slowly. In addition, there’s evidence that this is not bureaucracy for bureaucracy’s sake -- many of the positions increasing in recent years directly support students. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10917	"One out of every 30 people in the Greater Boston area is an illegal alien."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/31/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-says-1-out-30-greater-boston-country/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions went to Boston to announce a law enforcement operation against "crimes committed predominantly by illegal aliens," offering as context the number of immigrants in the country illegally who live in Boston and surrounding areas. He said identity theft was a "very common" offense committed by immigrants in the country illegally and gave an example of a defendant accused of stealing the identity of an American citizen displaced by recent hurricanes in Puerto Rico. "Just imagine if you lost your home and your possessions and then you found out that an illegal alien had stolen your identity," Sessions said. The Greater Boston area, Sessions said, is one of the country's top 12 metro areas that's home to immigrants here illegally. "According to these estimates, one out of every 30 people in the Greater Boston area is an illegal alien," Sessions said. We wondered if Sessions’ claim was correct. We found that nonpartisan data supports his claim. The Justice Department linked us to a February 2017 report from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center on the metro areas with the most immigrants living there without legal permission, based on 2014 estimates. Unauthorized immigrants accounted for 3.5 percent of the national population in 2014, Pew found. The Boston metro area — encompassing parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire — in 2014 had an estimated 180,000 unauthorized immigrants, or 3.7 percent of the area’s total population. (Margin of error was plus or minus 20,000 people.) The Boston metro area had more than 4.7 million people in 2014, according to the Census Bureau. Calculations of the Census’ 2014 population estimates and Pew’s estimates of the unauthorized population in 2014 (including with the margin of error) show Sessions’ claim was largely on target, if not underestimated. Dividing the Boston metro area’s current population of more than 4.8 million, by the lowest 2014 estimate of unauthorized immigrants, 160,000 (using Pew’s margin of error), leads to exactly "one out of every 30," as Sessions said. "We have a very immigrant-rich and diverse population, especially in Boston and adjacent cities, and a fraction of those immigrants are undocumented," said Marion Davis, Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition spokeswoman. "In (the city of) Boston, more than 27 percent of the population is foreign-born," Davis said. In nearby Chelsea, 45 percent of the population is foreign-born, she noted. Our ruling Sessions said, "One out of every 30 people in the Greater Boston area is an illegal alien." Sessions’ claim is supported by estimates from Pew Research Center and U.S. Census Bureau data. Factoring in a margin of error in Pew’s study would make Sessions’ claim a conservative estimate. We rate his statement True.

pomt-03333	Says Obama policies contributed to gas prices rising from $1.89 in January 2009 to $3.51 today.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jul/23/roger-williams/says-obama-policies-contributed-raising-gas-prices/	U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, said in a recent newsletter to constituents in his District 25 that Washington is making it harder to produce home-grown energy. A reader wrote us July 1, 2013, asking us to check this claim: "In January of 2009, a gallon of gasoline cost $1.89. Today, the average cost of a gallon of gasoline is $3.51," Williams wrote in the mailer. "It doesn’t take an economist to figure out how a gallon of gasoline has increased by $1.62 in four years. The liberal anti-free market policies of the Obama administration discourage the exploration of American sources of energy and hinder production and job growth." This is a popular theme; we fact-checked Texas Republicans who blamed high gas prices on Obama in 2011 and 2012. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst earned a Mostly False rating last year for claiming a gallon cost $4.50, and Michael Williams, now the state education commissioner, got a Half True for saying in 2011 that gas prices had gone up $2 under Obama. Experts told us it’s hard to pin such prices on a president. The national and state-level PolitiFact operations have checked numerous gas-price claims and are fairly consistent in saying presidents can’t correctly be praised or blamed for what you pay at the pump; world gas prices and many other factors are beyond their control. Graves emailed us historical gas-price data from the federal Energy Information Administration; we also collected data from Gasbuddy.com, which says it collects information from its website and app users, credit card transactions and gas stations, as well as from AAA, a federation of motorist clubs that according to aaa.com surveys U.S. self-serve gas stations for prices. We were unable to get precise detail on what type of gas and which calendar dates the newsletter referred to. To cover the bases, we looked at prices at the end of December 2008, the month of January 2009 and the end of April 2013 (to be certain the information would have been available for an article written in May). The energy agency had data for several types of gas, so we collected their prices for regular gas and for an average of all grades and formulations. Gasbuddy and AAA only had statistics for regular gas. Any way we measured, Williams’ comparison held up or got stronger. According to the three sources, regular gas at the end of December 2008 cost between $1.61 and $1.64 and regular gas at the end of April 2013 cost between $3.50 (a penny less than Williams said) and $3.52. The energy agency data showed all grades/all formulations averaged $1.67 a gallon at the end of December 2008 and $3.59 at the end of April 2013. Williams’ claim had gas jumping $1.62. In the datasets we looked at, gas rose at least $1.87 and at most $1.92. (Gasbuddy, which ranks Austin gas stations’ lowest prices daily at www.austingasprices.com, showed a similar jump in Texas and Austin regular gas, though generally Texas prices ran a dime or more below national prices and Austin’s prices ran 6 cents to 9 cents below Texas around those dates.) So the congressman’s estimate seems correct -- even conservative. But were liberal policies to blame for the increase? AAA and Gasbuddy spokesmen and a former Houston Chronicle journalist who covered business, including the oil and gas industry, told us that presidents have little sway over gas prices. All three said the biggest reason for the $2 jump during Williams’ timeframe was that gas prices -- along with other commodities and, indeed, the global economy -- crashed just before Obama took office. A decade of gas prices, from Gasbuddy.com Weekly U.S. prices for a gallon of regular gasoline. Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at Gasbuddy, laid out key dates: With the U.S. economy starting to falter, regular gas hit an all-time high of $4.12 on July 15, 2008. Mega-investment bank Lehman Bros. filed for bankruptcy Sept. 15, 2008, triggering global financial crisis. Gas prices took their biggest drop in history, bottoming out at $1.61 on Dec. 31, 2008. Obama was sworn in Jan. 20, 2009. "Without a recession," DeHaan told us by phone, "gas prices would probably not have gotten to that low before Obama took office." Politicians’ failure to mention the crash in such comparisons is a "glaring omission," he said. "It just so happened that the timing was not in Obama’s favor." Prices were going up in the 2000s before the collapse, AAA spokesman Michael Green told us by phone, "primarily due to the strengthening economy in China. As China demanded more petroleum products, it created increased demand around the world and we saw the global price of petroleum increase." Future prices could drop with increasing North American production, said Loren Steffy, a longtime business journalist who wrote a book on 2010’s BP oil rig disaster in the Gulf. But, he said via email, "I still believe global demand will surpass supply in the long term, so prices will continue to rise over time." Global crude oil prices, seasonal demand from U.S. drivers and hurricanes all affect what Americans pay at the pump. DeHaan said that refineries have significant annual effects when they conduct maintenance in spring and October and and sell inventory at the end of the year for tax purposes. So would the president have been able to keep prices from rising as much by altering the policies Williams mentioned? Obama has long faced Republican criticism for keeping oil reserves in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve off limits, restricting some drilling off Alaska’s shore and in the Gulf of Mexico and rejecting the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion that would connect Canadian oil to Texas refineries. But U.S. oil production has increased dramatically in the past three years, and as we’ve seen, U.S. gas prices still rose overall. The big U.S. production increases, Green said, have been in North Dakota and Texas shale rock formations that technology has made more accessible. Texas production more than doubled and North Dakota’s nearly tripled in those three years, he said. "But you have to keep in mind that oil is sold on a global market. So if less oil is being produced somewhere else, then you’re still seeing the same amount of oil being produced in the world and the global price sort of remains unchanged," Green said. "And we have seen some indications that places in the Middle East or Venezuela are not producing as much oil as they did in the past." Steffy said, "Offshore Alaska is expensive, a huge technological challenge and decades away from production. The Gulf of Mexico is pretty lucrative, but" it might not have a big effect on world supply. "You could open ANWR and you could push ahead with offshore Alaska, but it would be years or decades before they entered production. So the short-term effect on gas prices would be zero, and the long term would be negligible because while the supply is important from a U.S. standpoint, prices are determined globally and there won't be enough production there to meaningfully lower prices on a global scale." DeHaan offered similar views, saying, "Alaska doesn’t really matter. Alaska was a gusher a hundred years ago" and Gulf production volume isn’t enough to have a big effect. "If the president is limiting new production in the Gulf, that’s probably having some impact, but I would say it’s only a few dollars a barrel," he said. "In the grand scheme of things, that’s not your smoking gun." On Jan. 18, 2012, Obama rejected TransCanada Corp.’s request to build the northern part of the Keystone XL Pipeline extension, from Canada to Nebraska. TransCanada put in a new application now being weighed by the State Department and went ahead with the Texas segment of Keystone XL, which didn’t require presidential permission because it doesn’t cross a U.S. border; it runs from Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast refineries and is nearly complete. Green said it’s difficult to tell what impact presidential approval would have made, but said, "You would not have seen a dramatic change in gas prices" because "Keystone would be one pipeline of many." Those other pipelines include the existing Keystone pipe from Canada to Oklahoma, completed in 2011, and Canadian firm Enbridge’s pipeline system, which a July 18, 2013, Reuters news story called "the single largest source of U.S. oil imports." DeHaan speculated that the Keystone XL extension could actually raise gas prices in the U.S. by giving Canada access to Houston’s ports and thus the world market (Canadian oil prices having been relatively low because its supplies were more or less "landlocked"). Steffy didn’t view that as a big risk, but said he thought Keystone’s biggest effect would be on energy security rather than prices. "The benefit to the U.S. is that we get a steady supply from our strongest ally," he said. "Better Canada than Venezuela." Our ruling Williams said Obama policies caused gas prices to rise from $1.89 in 2009 to $3.51 today. He’s got the prices correct, but experts say presidents don’t generally have the ability to make them rise or fall and didn’t see that reversing Alaska, Gulf or Keystone policies would have necessarily kept prices from rising as much. But the big problem with ascribing this specific jump to Obama is the failure to point out that prices collapsed right before he took office. Leaving out the economy’s epic, history-making collapse might ordinarily earn such a claim a Pants on Fire rating. Because Williams cited prices accurately, we’ll rate his claim as Mostly False.

pomt-08952	"It turns out that Texas has an $18 billion budget shortfall and can't afford its new science textbooks."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/23/stephen-colbert/stephen-colbert-says-texas-cant-afford-new-science/	Rocker Alice Cooper famously sang "school's out for summer," and on the July 6 episode of The Colbert Report, host Stephen Colbert saluted the "noted educator," but amended the lyric. "Depending on budget cuts, it could be out forever," he said. We won't take him too literally, since he also said that the Texas State Board of Education revised the state's social studies curriculum standards "so the books would no longer say that Sen. (Joseph) McCarthy was engaged in a witch hunt, but, instead, was the star of Bewitched." Still, another claim caught our ear: "It turns out that Texas has an $18 billion budget shortfall and can't afford its new science textbooks," he said, as a May 18 Austin American-Statesman article flashed on the screen. Since Colbert has his "I's on Edjukashun," a segment on his show about education news nationwide, we wondered whether he got that write. Er, right. When we contacted Colbert to elaborate, a spokeswoman told us that the show was on vacation until July 26, so we forged ahead. First, let's look at the budget shortfall. In a May 11 meeting of the House Appropriations committee, Wayne Pulver, assistant director of the Legislative Budget Board, told legislators the reasons the state is facing a budget gap. The board, which prepares a draft of the budget bill for legislators each session, also crunches the numbers that inform legislative spending decisions. At the hearing, Pulver confirmed that lawmakers will start the next legislative session with a budget gap because of funds that will no longer be available from sizeable sources that helped balance the 2010-11 budget: $6.4 billion in federal stimulus money and $5.6 billion in one-time state funds. Those figures jibe with an analysis the budget board produced in March for the committee. John O'Brien, the board's executive director, pegged the budget gap at $11 billion, but cautioned that his figure assumed no growth in state spending or revenue. At the May hearing, Pulver detailed factors expected to increase the shortfall, including that revenue could fail to meet projections and that spending may increase to accommodate growth in demand for programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. When committee chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, asked whether "that could add up to between $15 and $18 billion," Pulver called the range "reasonable." Of course, projections are uncertain. In April, Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told the San Antonio-Express News in April that the budget gap couldn't yet be defined "because you don't know — when you say shortfall, you imply some sort of mandatory spending level and some sort of predetermined revenue level, neither of which we have. There's no shortfall if you don't spend it. And we don't know yet what our revenue projections are." How about them textbooks? On May 21, the education board voted to postpone issuing textbook Proclamation 2012, which calls for the purchase of new science textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade, according to the Texas Education Agency. The science books were estimated to cost $347 million, in addition to $888 million necessary to cover already-approved English materials, continuing contracts and freight. "The state's looming budget deficit, estimated to be $18 billion in the next biennium," pushed the board's decision, according to TEA, and members instead decided to update the current textbooks with supplemental online material that covers the new science curriculum standards the board approved last year for science classes in fifth through eighth grade, plus biology, chemistry, physics and integrated physics and chemistry. What did we learn? Colbert cherry-picked the higher figure of the budget board's latest shortfall projection — $18 billion — but so did the education agency in explaining the education board's decision to delay buying new science textbooks.

pomt-05834	Says unemployment would be at 10 percent if people who have quit looking for work were included in federal labor force calculations.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/17/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-unemployment-would-be-10-percent-/	Economists view unemployment data that the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases each month as a way to gauge whether the nation is shaking off the effects of the recession that’s hindered U.S. growth since December 2007. Politicians use those statistics to claim credit for economic healing, or blame rivals for failing to get the job done. Falling unemployment rates are seen as beneficial to President Barack Obama’s re-election prospects, so Republicans have been eager to minimize recent unemployment reductions. When the BLS released reported that unemployment dipped to 8.3 percent in January 2012 - the lowest rate in nearly three years - Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, greeted the news with a statement that claimed the BLS measurements neglected other data that would reveal higher unemployment. "It’s good to see that there has been some improvement in the unemployment rate and that people are starting to get back to work," Portman said. "However, this doesn’t take into account the 3-million-person reduction in labor force participation compared to pre-recession levels. If those people were still counted within the labor force, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, which is a more accurate gauge of the current jobs environment." PolitiFact Ohio asked Portman where he got his statistics and why he believes they’re more accurate than the more-commonly used official unemployment estimates. His office said that the official unemployment rate measures only people actively seeking jobs. It doesn’t account for people who have quit their search for employment and found something else to do, like staying home with their children or going back to school. Portman’s office attributes much of a drop that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has observed in the nation’s labor force participation rate to people who have dropped out of the workforce in this fashion but would prefer to have jobs. The labor force participation rate fell to 63.7 percent last month, down from 66 percent when the recession began in December 2007. That change is important for Portman’s calculations. His staff walked us through the math. If the labor force participation were still at 66 percent, civilian workforce would be around 159.9 million people instead of today’s 154.4 million people - a difference of about 5.5 million. To be conservative in his estimates, Portman went with 3 million. He added that to both 12,768,000 (people who are currently unemployed) and 154.4 million (today’s civilian workforce) to compute a new unemployment rate. Working through the math, the 15,768,000 people who are actually unemployed under Portman’s scenario would be divided by 157,400,000, the number he computes as the actual civilian workforce, translating to a 10 percent unemployment rate. "Thus, there are 3 million people who would work if they could, but instead are sitting on the sidelines due to the sluggish economy," said Portman spokeswoman Christine Mangi. "That means 10 percent of the population that wants to work cannot. This is a useful measure of true unemployment." Portman’s office cited a research paper written by GOP economist at Hamilton Place Strategies. It cites a similar figure as Portman - 3.2 million - as the number of "missing workers who should be participating in the labor force but are not actively seeking work." It acknowledges that the peak rate of 67 percent labor force participation during the dot-com bubble was expected to decline because of demographic shifts, such as retirement of Baby Boomers. But it asserts that current labor participation is 1.3 percentage points lower than those demographic estimates would predict, "the equivalent of 3.2 million missing workers." A January report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office used a similar approach. It estimated about a third of the 2 percent decline in labor participation between 2007 and the second half of 2011 reflected factors other than the downturn, such as the aging of the Baby Boom generation. Because the report was produced before the most recent unemployment statistics were released, its labor participation and unemployment rates vary slightly from the latest numbers. "Had that portion of the decline in the labor force participation rate since 2007 that is attributable to neither the aging of the Baby Boomers nor the downturn in the business cycle (on the basis of the experience in previous downturns) not occurred, the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 would have been about 1.25 percentage points higher than the actual rate of 8.7 percent," that CBO report says. Those numbers together produce a percentage close to Portman’s, although it reflects statistics from the end of 2011, not January 2012. BLS economist Jim Walker declined to assess Portman’s calculations, but said BLS would never assume that an extra 3 million people added to the workforce would all be unemployed. He also noted that his agency tracks the number of people outside the workforce who say they want a job. Those individuals must have searched for work during the past year, but not the month before they were surveyed. BLS counted 4,697,000 such people in December 2007, the month the recession officially began, and 6,319,000 of them in January 2012. The 1,622,000 increase is significantly less than the 3 million rise that Portman claims occurred over that period. Walker also pointed us to a research paper produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago which attributes just under half of the 3.3 percent decline in the U.S. labor force participation rate since 2000 to shifting demographics, like the retiring Baby Boomers. Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and former Labor Department chief economist, suggested a third BLS statistic would best show the true proportion of people who want jobs but lack them. In January 2012, according to BLS, 15.1 percent of U.S. workers were either working part-time jobs even though they desired full-time work or were unemployed but wanted a job and had looked for one within the past year. In December 2007, the month the recession began, BLS listed that number at 8.8 percent. At that time, regular unemployment rate was 5 percent "It seems like Sen. Portman used a lower measure than he could have come out with," said Furchtgott-Roth. "Rather than doing his own calculations, it seems like he should use theirs, since they have gone to the trouble of measuring it with their monthly survey of 60,000 households." Labor participation peaked around the turn of the century, Furtchgott-Roth said. In addition to Baby Boomer retirements and a shortage of jobs during the recession, the size of the workforce has been depleted by an accelerated number of people who have gone on the Social Security’s disability rolls. According to the Social Security Administration, the number of people collecting disability benefits rose from 7.1 million in 2007 to 8.2 million in 2012. Furtchgott-Roth says unemployment is a particular problem for recent college graduates. Portman’s assertion is partly accurate. Nobody disputes his contention that the recession elevated the number of Americans who want jobs but are not seeking to be part of the workforce, and that the nation’s official unemployment rate would be higher if those people were included. But there’s no consensus on how to find the best alternative number. BLS itself produces options that fall on either side of Portman’s suggested number. The extra 3 million people that Portman counts as unemployed is an estimate -- one that includes all people but not participating in the workforce as unemployed. That’s something BLS cautioned against. That Portman opted to use an estimate, rather than one of the many alternative unemployment indicators that BLS calculates, undermines his assertion that the 10 percent unemployment rate is a "more accurate gauge of the current jobs environment," than BLS numbers. Those are important details needed to evaluate his claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s claim rates Half True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2012-02-17T06:00:00	2012-02-03	['None']

pomt-09533	Says Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison "took 154 private flights all funded by taxpayers" though "commercial flights were readily available at a fraction of the cost."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/10/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-sen-hutchison-took-154-private-pla/	Gov. Rick Perry’s high-flying campaign — he’s led Republican foes in pre-primary polls — posted a catchy video online last week depicting challenger Kay Bailey Hutchison, the state’s senior U.S. senator, as a profligate jet-setter. The nearly two-minute ad floats both a broad charge and one suggesting she’s beholden to special interests. The big charge: Hutchison has taken 154 trips on private jets, many between airports offering commercial flights at a fraction of the cost. The second hit: Her flights include trips on jets provided by lobbyists, donors and corporations with business before Hutchison in Washington. Perry’s spot, titled "Wanna Get Away?," is a play on commercials for Southwest Airlines. Fergie, lead singer of the Black Eyed Peas, sings "Glamorous" as images of a smiling Hutchison flit past, including the senator standing next to Lance Armstrong on an airport tarmac near a jet. Fergie's lush performance neatly reinforces the ad's imagery. Still, we wondered if Perry accurately characterized Hutchison’s flightiness. His campaign shared with us their original sources, which were reports covering every senator's expenses compiled by the Secretary of the U.S. Senate. Most of Hutchison's private-plane flights are identified in the reports with the name of the plane provider, though about 20 didn't show how the senator made her trip; Perry's campaign said it assumed she took private planes because she reported visits to several cities in a day not connected by commercial flights. Hutchison’s campaign spotted a couple of erroneous dates in Perry's charts of Hutchison flights, but didn't quiible with the overall tabulation of 154 Hutchison flights on private planes from July 1994, about a year after Hutchison joined the Senate, into June 2009, or with Perry’s claim that the itemized trips were reimbursed with $518,892.39 in federal funds. Hutchison spokeswoman Jennifer Baker stressed that using private planes is a common permitted practice in the Senate. "There’s not anything wrong with it," Baker said. Baker said senators are permitted to use private jets for official business and seek federal reimbursement for the cost of the charter. Before 2007, members could use federal money to reimburse providers of private plane trips only as much as the cost of a first-class plane ticket or the highest commercial fare. "It is the policy of Sen. Hutchison’s office to use the most cost-effective means of transportation that allows her to fulfill her official obligations," Baker said. "Part of her effectiveness as Texas’ senior senator is a result of her work ethic, which requires early-morning travel, late-night travel and stops in numerous cities in one day. Commercial travel is not always an option." Baker also pointed out that photos in the ad of Hutchison next to the jet with Armstrong and inside a jet, seated in an aisle seat, leave a mistaken impression. They both were taken by news organizations last year when Hutchison chartered the jet to kick off her gubernatorial campaign. Contrary to the gist of Perry's ad, that travel was funded by Hutchison's campaign, not taxpayers. (According to campaign finance filings, Hutchison spent nearly $176,000 in campaign funds on chartered jets while stumping for governor from July through December.) Did Hutchison routinely lean on special interests to provide planes for her travel, as Perry's ad implies? Doesn't look like it. From 2000 through 2009, Perry's campaign found, 15 trips were provided by campaign donors, lobbyists or corporations at a reimbursed cost of $12,461. Let's put that in perspective: The 15 flights amounted to 10 percent of Hutchison’s 154 reimbursed private flights since 1994 or 2.4 percent of her total reimbursements for private flights. Perry's campaign didn't offer evidence that any private flight was linked to a Hutchison vote or deal, though a Perry spokesman said the corporations that provided jets — businesses including giants like Clear Channel and TXU Corp., the utility company that became Energy Future Holdings—"constantly have business before her committees." The senator is the highest-ranking Republican on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. She’s also on the Senate’s panels for appropriations; banking, housing and urban affairs; and rules and administration. Three individuals provided private planes for Hutchison: attorney Tom Luce and developer Mike A. Myers, both of Dallas, and San Antonio lawyer and former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler. Loeffler is a registered federal lobbyist, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Perry’s campaign reminded us, correctly, that Hutchison also has received campaign donations from leaders of the plane-providing interests. Next, we tried to pin whether Hutchison took private flights when commercial alternatives were readily available, as Perry’s ad says. Baker, of Hutchison’s campaign, said the senator chooses private flights only when commercial flights don't match up with her busy schedule. "Oftentimes, her schedule is such that chartered travel is the only means to allow her to fulfill her duties," Baker said. "In a large state like Texas, you have a finite amount of time in the state. You have to maximize that time." We asked about an Oct. 3, 2008, jet trip highlighted in Perry’s ad, which claims the same round trip between Dallas and Austin would have cost $306 on Southwest Airlines. We weren't able to verify that fare, though the current roundtrip Southwest fare would run from as little as $98 if flights were booked well in advance to $320 if arranged at the last minute. Baker said Hutchison took a charter, costing $5,523, because she didn’t complete an evening speaking engagement near Austin for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation until 8:45 p.m. Asked if Hutchison could have stayed overnight in Austin, returning to Dallas on a commercial flight the next day, Baker said she didn’t know what the senator had scheduled that next morning. Another private plane trip noted in Perry’s ad—roundtrip between Dallas and Houston on Sept. 14, 2008, at a cost of $5,732 — could have cost $302 on Southwest Airlines, according to Perry’s campaign. Baker said Hutchison and her aide couldn’t fly commercial that day because she toured hurricane damage in Galveston until after 8:30 p.m., too late to catch a commercial flight back to Dallas. At our request, Juan Portillo, president of an Austin-based travel management firm, Tramex Travel, looked over the Perry campaign's summary of Hutchison’s 154 private plane trips. Portillo concluded that many of them could not have been efficiently planned employing commercial airline flights partly because there are no direct flights connecting cities like Harlingen and Waco, to name one Hutchison trip, or Victoria and Corpus Christi and Lufkin, which was another. "No way you can do it" in a day without using chartered planes, Portillo said. The upshot: Perry accurately identified 154 taxpayer-funded private plane trips taken by Hutchison during 16 years of her Senate service, including 15 planes provided by donors, corporations and one identified lobbyist from 2000 through 2009. That single lobbyist does not support the ad's three references to "lobbyists." And Perry's claim that Hutchison could instead have taken readily available commercial flights for her trips is questionable. We rate Perry's ad as Half True.

pomt-05882	On fundraising for super PACs	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/07/barack-obama/obama-campaign-says-officials-will-now-appear-supe/	"Neither the president nor his campaign staff or aides will fundraise for super PACs." — President Barack Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt, July 9, 2011 "Senior campaign officials as well as some White House and Cabinet officials will attend and speak at (super PAC) Priorities USA fundraising events." — President Barack Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, Feb. 6, 2012 A fundraising decision by President Barack Obama’s campaign in February 2012 prompted news headlines on the "reversal" and a Republican Web video on a "failed promise." We figured it was time to crank up the Flip-O-Meter. Here’s the question: Did the Obama campaign change its stance on fundraising for super PACs? These new political action committees weren’t an option in 2008. Super PACs grew from a federal court case in 2010, SpeechNow.org vs. Federal Election Commission. The decision allows super PACs to raise unlimited amounts of money to independently advocate for candidates. (Traditional PACs have contribution limits.) Like traditional PACs, they must disclose their donors to the election commission but may not donate directly to candidates and may not coordinate directly with campaigns. Now there are 313 of them, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, that have raised nearly $99 million. They’ve spent $45 million in the 2012 campaign cycle as of Feb. 7, 2012. That’s not including cash raised by other kinds of advocacy groups that spend money to affect elections, which include 527s and some 501(c)s. The 527s, for example, may spend unlimited contributions on voter mobilization and issues without filing disclosure reports with the FEC. The president has railed against such unlimited fundraising and spending, especially by organizations that are not required to disclose their spending or donors. He also specifically opposed a January 2010 Supreme Court decision, Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, that paved the way for super PACs by preventing the government from restricting independent political spending by corporations and unions. Two notable examples were Obama’s 2010 State of the Union speech and comments at a Democratic rally in Philadelphia before the 2010 midterm elections. 2010 State of the Union: "With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign corporations — to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems." Moving America Forward rally: "At the end of the day, Philly, whether the Republicans get the keys back or not is going to depend on you. There is no question — there’s no question the other side sees a chance to get back in the driver’s seat. "And thanks to a Supreme Court decision called Citizens United, they are being helped along this year by special interest groups that are spending unlimited amounts of money on attack ads ... just attacking people without ever disclosing who’s behind all these attack ads. You don’t know. It could be the oil industry. It could be the insurance industry. It could even be foreign-owned corporations. You don’t know because they don’t have to disclose. "Now, that’s not just a threat to Democrats — that’s a threat to our democracy." Advocacy groups spent furiously against Democrats in the midterm elections, but still the Obama campaign remained resolute, even in November 2011, as groups supporting Republicans vying to unseat him in November raised millions. The Boston Globe reported this statement from a spokesman in July 2011: "Neither the president nor his campaign staff or aides will fundraise for super PACs," said spokesman Ben LaBolt. "Our campaign will continue to lead the way when it comes to transparency and reform — refusing contributions from Washington lobbyists and PACs and disclosing the names of donors who are fundraising for the campaign." But on Feb. 6, 2012, the president’s re-election campaign, with Obama’s support, decided to lend a hand to a pro-Obama super PAC, Priorities USA Action. Why? Obama campaign manager Jim Messina explained the decision in a blog post titled, "We will not play by two sets of rules." Super PACs affiliated with Republican presidential candidates, he said, have spent more than $40 million on television and radio over the last few months, almost all of it for negative ads. (Priorities USA Action, on the other hand, has raised just $4.4 million, spending less than $400,000 so far, according to the Center on Responsive Politics.) "With so much at stake, we can't allow for two sets of rules in this election whereby the Republican nominee is the beneficiary of unlimited spending and Democrats unilaterally disarm," he wrote. So the campaign will now "support" Priorities USA, he said, by sending senior campaign officials, and some White House and Cabinet officials, to speak at super PAC fundraisers. Messina said Obama still supports a law to force "full disclosure of all funding intended to influence our elections," and favors limits on special interest spending, "by constitutional amendment, if necessary." Messina also drew a distinction between the campaign’s super PAC fundraiser participation and soliciting funds: "While campaign officials may be appearing at events to amplify our message, these folks won't be soliciting contributions for Priorities USA. I should also note that the president, vice president, and first lady will not be a part of this effort; their political activity will remain focused on the president's campaign." While there may be a formal line campaign officials won’t cross, we see a distinction without a difference. Would the average person consider a campaign or White House official speaking at a fundraiser "fundraising," whether or not the speaker directly asked for money? We think so. Our ruling We don’t take a position on the merits of a flip. We’re just interested in whether a person’s position has changed. In this case, Obama and his campaign have gone from refusing to fundraise for super PACs to declaring that senior officials will attend and speak at Priorities USA fundraising events. We respect that the president himself won’t participate, and that he still plans to fight the role of special interest money in campaigns, but that’s a major reversal of position, and we rate it a Full Flop.

pomt-00796	Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell is "allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford Schools."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/apr/06/susan-stimpson/susan-stimpson-says-bill-howell-tied-group-seeking/	There’s little subtlety in the strategy guiding Susan Stimpson’s GOP primary challenge against House Speaker Bill Howell for his Stafford County seat. Stimpson, a Tea Party favorite and former chair of county’s board of supervisors, keeps saying Howell has lost his conservative moorings. A case in point is this headline Stimpson posted on her Facebook Page: "BILL HOWELL is allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford Schools." Flushing out this claim requires two determinations: Is there a group seeking to establish unisex bathrooms in Stafford County schools and, if so; is Howell allied to it? Let’s get to work. The group Stimson’s claim springs from debate in Stafford over which bathrooms should be used by a transgender fourth-grader at Hartwood Elementary School. The student, who identifies as a female, had been allowed to use the girls’ restroom. That drew opposition from a parents’ group called Save Our Schools, who said their daughters were being required to use a bathroom with a boy. The county school board held a public hearing on March 24 and most of the speakers, according to the Free Lance-Star in nearby Fredericksburg, opposed the student using the girls’ bathroom. Later in the meeting, the board unanimously voted that the student must instead use either a single stall restroom at the school, a staff bathroom or the boys’ restroom. What about the group that Stimpson says was "pushing mixed sex bathrooms in Stafford County schools?" Stimpson’s campaign told us she was referring to Equality Virginia, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transexual Virginians. Before the vote, Virginia Lambeck, Equality Virginia’s program director, emailed Stafford school board members, urging them to adopt a countywide policy that would allow transgender students to chose which bathrooms to use. Lambeck attached model policies drafted by the Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network and the Massachusetts Department of Education. James Parrish, Equality Virginia’s executive director, emailed us that allowing transgender students to use the restrooms of their preference makes schools more welcoming to them. "Transgender children, like all children, are balancing academic requirements with extracurricular activities and a social life, they are managing relationships with parents, teachers, and friends, and they are thinking about their future" he wrote. "Being stigmatized for who they are should not be part of any child’s growing up." Now, let’s move on to the speaker. Is Howell "allied" with Equality Virginia? Stimpson’s campaign says Howell’s PAC -- Dominion Leadership Trust -- accepted $6,000 in contributions from Equality Virginia from 2006 through 2012 and that the speaker has supported the LGBT group on some key issues. Howell’s PAC did indeed receive $6,000 from the group during that span, according to records from the Virginia Public Access Project. It should be noted that Equality Virginia hasn’t given anything to the speaker’s PAC since 2012. For perspective, Howell’s PAC collected almost $11.8 million from 2006 through 2014. Equality Virginia’s donations account for 1/20th of 1 percent of that sum. As for Howell’s voting record, Rollin Reisinger, Stimpson’s campaign manager emailed us that "Howell may not support everything on Equality Virginia's agenda, but he has been an ally on certain issues." He cited two instances: In 2013, Howell voted to appoint an openly gay judge, Tracy Thorne-Begland, to the Richmond Manchester General District Court. Earlier this year, legislation that would have allowed the speaker to a hire a lawyer to defend a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and woman died in the House Rules Committee, which Howell chairs. Individual votes were not recorded. Howell supported a similar measure to protect the marriage amendment in 2014 when Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, said he would not defend challenges to it. Equality Virginia offers a different take on Howell. Its legislative scorecard says Howell opposed its agenda on six of eight issues in 2012 and 2013. Howell, for example: Voted for a successful bill that allows private adoption and foster agencies to bypass prospective LGBT parents on grounds of religious or moral convictions.. Voted against unsuccessful legislation that would have prevented LGBT children from being placed in foster homes where the parents believe that "being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is a behavior rather than an in-born, immutable characteristic." We should note that Equality Virginia did not publish a House scorecard in 2014. That’s because almost all of the bills on its agenda were killed in committees and never reached the floor. The group faced the same results this year. "Similar to previous years, despite all our hard work, it’s disappointing – but not surprising – to see the House of Delegates stand in the way to creating a welcoming and inclusive Virginia," the group said in its 2015 legislative wrap-up. Parrish, the executive director of Equality Virginia, said his group used to give money to Howell’s PAC because it wanted to contribute to both political parties -- a strategy frequently used by special interests. The speaker, he added, has not responded with kindness. "While it would be great to have support from the House leadership on our issues, Speaker Howell has not done anything to assist Equality Virginia with our legislative agenda of seeking fairness and equality for LGBT Virginians," Parrish said in a prepared statement. Matthew Moran, a spokesman for Howell, offered the same sentiment. "Under (Howell’s) leadership, the House has defeated nearly every single one of Equality Virginia’s legislative priorities," he emailed. As for the transgender bathroom issue, Moran said Howell discussed the matter with Stafford school board members before the vote and "supports their decision 100 percent." Our ruling Stimpson wrote "BILL HOWELL is allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford schools." Equality Virginia unsuccessfully advocated allowing transgender students in Stafford to use the restrooms of their choice. Stimpson’s statement makes it sound like the LGBT group wanted a broad policy that would have allowed all students of either sex to use the same bathrooms. That’s not the case. When proposed, the debate focused on one fourth-grader at one school. The connection between Equality Virginia and Howell is equally tenuous. The group made annual donations totaling $6,000 to Howell’s multi-million dollar PAC from 2006 to 2012. What Stimpson omits is that Equality Virginia has not contributed to the PAC in more than two years. The group decided, well in advance of restroom issue, that Howell was unfriendly to LGBT issues and now says Howell "has not done anything to assist" it. So any small comity that once may have existed between the speaker and Equality Virginia is certainly dead. We rate Stimpson’s statement False.

pomt-12078	"We stopped traffic coming through -- 78 percent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-false-claim-about-border-stop/	A border wall with Mexico is needed for security reasons, even though traffic coming through has stopped significantly, claimed President Donald Trump. Trump has threatened a government shutdown if Congress doesn’t pass a bill allocating funds for parts of his promised border wall, despite his campaign assurances that Mexico would pay for the costs. "The wall is needed from the standpoint of security. The wall is needed from the standpoint of drugs -- tremendous, the drug scourge, what's coming through the areas that we're talking about," Trump said at an Aug. 28 press conference. "As you know, I have General (John) Kelly here. We stopped traffic coming through, 78 percent. It's going to be, I think, 81 percent this quarter, which is a record." Trump also claimed that during past administrations "if they stopped it just a little bit, like 1 or 2 or 3 percent, they consider that a great thing. We're up to almost 80 percent." Trump has made similar statements before about his administration’s control of the southwest border, using different timeframes to claim the greatest success. Has the Trump administration "stopped traffic" at the border by 78 percent? Not exactly. The most commonly used metric to gauge illegal immigration is border apprehensions, and the most recent data available do not support the claim. The White House did not provide information to support or clarify the president’s claim, despite our repeated requests. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data In past claims Trump has relied on year-over-year numbers, month-to-month data and the stretch from November 2016 (election month) to February. We compared the latest Border Patrol apprehension figures available (July 2017) to scenarios Trump has used before and did not find the 78 percent decline he claimed. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that in July 2017 there were 18,198 apprehensions at the southwest border. Here’s how the number of apprehensions have changed: • From July 2016 to July 2017, down 46 percent;​ • From June 2017 to July 2017, up 13 percent; • From November 2016 to July 2017, down 61 percent. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker has noted that apprehensions are close to an 80 percent decline by cherry-picking the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). That yields a 76 percent decrease. At the press conference, Trump also commented about needing a U.S.-Mexico border wall to fight the drug trade. We wondered if Trump’s "we stopped traffic coming through -- 78 percent" claim might refer to drug seizures, but available data did not support that statement. Customs and Border Protection publishes data on pounds of drugs seized by both Border Patrol officers and the agency’s Office of Field Operations. The agency has information on pounds seized (cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine) during fiscal years 2015 and 2016, and year-to-date for fiscal year 2017 (up to July 31, 2017). But that specific information is not singled out as being just for the southwest border, and it is not broken down per month. The agency did not get back to us by deadline with those detailed numbers. Comparisons of pounds seized (for each type of drug) from fiscal year 2016 to year-to-date fiscal year 2017 do not show a 78 percent change, either. There was a 93 percent decline in the pounds of ecstasy seized by Border Patrol agents — 15 pounds in 2016, 1 pound in 2017 so far. Our ruling Trump said, "We stopped traffic coming through -- 78 percent." Though Trump’s claim is vague, he’s made similar remarks about the border being "down 78 percent" and being "close to 80 percent stoppage." But the latest figures available for southwest border apprehensions do not support his claim. Only cherry-picked data would yield a 76 percent decline in apprehensions. Available information regarding drug seizures do not show a 78 percent decline, either. We rate Trump’s claim False.

mpws-00037	This week, the Minnesota Senate passed legislation that’s meant to address pay disparities and protect women in the workplace. Among other things, the legislation would require companies with government contracts to certify that they pay men and women equally, and require employers to be more flexible with pregnant and nursing mothers. State Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, sponsored the bill. She argued on the Senate floor that protecting female employees is critical for the economy because their salaries are more and more likely to their household’s primary source of income. “Fifty percent of the state’s working mothers are the primary breadwinner for their family, as the sole earner or earning more than their spouse,” Pappas said. She went on to add that, “the pay gap is stuck at about 20 percent, that is women earning 80 percent of what men do on average.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/04/poligraph-pappas-stats-about-women-workers-correct/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Pappas stats about women workers correct	April 25, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota']
pomt-06275	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack "voted to raise his own pay several times."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/nov/23/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-mack-repeatedly-voted-raise-his-own-p/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, the new apparent frontrunner in the GOP race for the U.S. Senate, is facing a barrage of criticism from one of his Republican rivals over congressional pay raises. George LeMieux's campaign has claimed at least three different times -- in a press release, an online ad and in a comment from its spokeswoman -- that Mack, a four-term congressman from Southwest Florida, "voted to raise his own pay several times." We found that examining the claim isn't so clear cut, largely because Congress probably wanted it that way. In 1989, Congress passed an ethics reform law that included an annual cost of living adjustment. The automatic pay raise was created in exchange for not getting paid for private speeches. The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatic unless Congress took a vote to stop it. The law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system where members of Congress receive raises without having to be on-record voting for them. Members of Congress certainly have seen their pay increase over time. Members initially received $6 a day in 1789; today they receive $174,000 annually. Here are the salaries for the years that Mack has served: Year Annual salary 2005 $162,100 2006 $165,200 2007 $165,200 2008 $169,300 2009 $174,000 2010 $174,000 2011 $174,000 So how did the LeMieux campaign back up its attack? Not with votes to raise congressional salaries -- as had been claimed -- but instead votes to prevent Congress from taking a vote to cancel the automatic pay adjustment. We'll slow that down. Since the raises are essentially automatic, the only thing Congress can do is stop the raises. In some cases, Congress -- and Mack -- voted not to vote on a measure to stop the raises. 2005: On June 28, 2005, Congress voted 263-152 with Mack in the majority on "ordering the previous question" to essentially block U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, from introducing a measure to block the pay raise. The vote was on House Resolution 342, which related to H.R. 3058, an appropriations bill for transportation and other areas. The practical effect of the vote: Members of Congress would receive a $3,100 pay raise, bringing their salary to $165,000. Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's spokesperson, explained the procedural move. "Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question," she told PolitiFact in an e-mail. "Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered his amendment to deny the annual Congressional pay raise. The process is designed to be obscure -- which is Matheson’s primary concern -- that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries." 2006: On June 13, 2006, Congress took a similar vote -- this time 249-167 with Mack in the majority -- on "ordering the previous question" which again halted Matheson's attempt for an up-or-down vote. The vote was on House Resolution 865, which related to H.R. 5576, an appropriations bill. The result: Members received a $3,300 pay raise increasing their salaries to $168,500. And then campaign season kicked in. Democrats vowed not to accept the pay raise until Congress approved an increase to the minimum wage. On. Dec. 8, 2006, the House voted 370-20 with Mack in the majority for a stopgap funding measure H.J. 102 until mid February 2007 -- delaying the pay raises. Democrats had planned to offer an amendment to delay the congressional pay raise, so "House GOP leaders decided to include language deferring the pay raise in the bill, taking away the Democrats' ability to make it an issue," Congressional Quarterly Today wrote in an article we found in Nexis. 2007: On Jan. 31, 2007, the House voted 286-140 H.J. Res. 20 for continuing appropriations. The summary of the law stated: "(Sec. 115) Prohibits the percentage salary adjustment scheduled to take effect for 2007 for Members of Congress from taking effect." Mack voted no, meaning he voted against the proposal canceling the 2007 raise. Then on June 27, 2007, the House voted 244-181 with Mack in the majority on an amendment related to appropriations bill H.R. 2829. The vote, like those in 2005 and 2006, prevented an up-or-down vote on a pay raise, the Associated Press reported. 2008: In 2008, a few lawmakers introduced measures that would have blocked pay raises for 2009 but the measures didn't get very far, allowing the automatic pay raises to kick in for the following year, Fox News reported. 2009: On Feb. 25, 2009, the House took some votes related to an omnibus appropriations act. This time Mack and a large majority of the House voted "yes" on House Resolution 184, which canceled the annual pay raise. The resolution passed 398-24. Later in the day, the House voted 245-178 with Mack voting no on the overall bill. 2010: By 2010, members were eagerly proposing bills to reject pay raises. On April 27, 2010, the House voted 402-15 with Mack in favor on House Resolution 5146 -- which plainly spelled out in the title that it would mean Congress would not receive a cost of living adjustment in fiscal year 2011. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It's worth noting here that LeMieux, appointed to the U.S. Senate in the summer of 2009 and serving throughout 2010, had joined the Senate by the time the tide among lawmakers had swung away from pay raises amid a troubled economy. And in 2010, Congress froze general service employees base pay through December 2012 so that meant member pay was also frozen. Our ruling The is an interesting case because Congress essentially created a system in 1989 that -- whether by design or not -- gives members like Mack some cover. LeMieux is wrong to say Mack voted to raise his pay, because he never did. Instead, Mack cast procedural votes that effectively allowed automatic pay raises to stand in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The practical effect of those votes meant Mack saw raises. On the flip side, LeMieux omitted that in 2009 and 2010 Mack took some votes against pay raises. To us, that's two caveats that bring our rating to Half True.	None	George LeMieux	None	None	None	2011-11-23T11:01:47	2011-10-27	['United_States', 'Connie_Mack_III']
pomt-05429	Says the Department of Homeland Security has ordered "enough rounds of .40 caliber ammunition to kill every man, woman and child in the United States," possibly to combat "massive civil unrest" or "an invasion by a foreign power."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/30/chain-email/chain-email-says-homeland-security-purchasing-many/	Stock up on soup. Account for children and pets. Lock the doors, dim the lights. A chain email forwarded to us by a reader March 24, 2012, suggests the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has mysteriously ordered a lot of bullets. Specifically, the email says, the department "has just executed an order for enough rounds of .40 caliber ammunition to kill every man, woman and child in the United States." "A shocking new defense contract entered by the 'department' to secure a massive amount of ammunition, with the option for infinite supply and infinite delivery, raising the question of just what they are preparing for?" the email says. "Massive civil unrest? An invasion by a foreign power? The order is to supply 450 Million Rounds of .40 Caliber ammunition which is more than one bullet for every single person in the United States." Yikes! Might the government be stocking up to battle civil unrest or resist an invasion? The declared number of bullets certainly exceeds the nation’s population. As of March 2012, according to U.S Census Bureau estimates, the country was home to 313 million people, making the ratio of bullets to residents about 1.4 to 1 -- if the email is firing on all cylinders. For insight about the .40-caliber bullet, we turned to Jeffrey Magers, a former police officer who teaches at California University of Pennsylvania. Magers said the described bullet is a standard police round used around the country. "They’re intended to flatten and do the most damage without passing through the body. It’s a shock-effect type of thing," he said in a telephone interview. "It’s intended to stop the threat." And did the government agree to buy 450 million rounds? The chain email links to a March 18, 2012, entry on the conservative Fellowship of the Minds blog referring to a posting on the PR Newswire website. On that site, we pulled up a March 12, 2012, release from Minnesota-based ATK, an aerospace, defense and commercial products company. The release says ATK has been awarded an "Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quality" agreement from Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for .40 caliber ammunition. "This contract features a base of 12 months, includes four option years, and will have a maximum volume of 450 million rounds," the release says. It adds that ATK already was supplying such ammunition. The release, noting that deliveries are expected to begin in June 2012, quotes Ron Johnson, president of ATK's Security and Sporting group, saying that the bullet will "continue to serve those who keep our borders safe." Next, we reached Homeland Security spokesman Matthew Chandler who said by email that the cited quantity of up to 450 million rounds is "the quantity projected to be used over the next five years." "This contract is intended to be used by all (agency) components, except" the U.S. Coast Guard, he said, which uses ammunition obtained through the Defense Department. According to a Homeland Security web page, the agency’s 20-plus components include the Transportation Security Administration, which handles passenger screening at most airports; U.S. Customs and Border Protection, entrusted with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the country and with enforcing immigration and drug laws; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Secret Service. Chandler’s email continues: "This contract is part of the department’s strategic sourcing efforts to combine multiple previous contracts in order to leverage the purchasing power of the entire department, including the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center," another Homeland Security component, "which trains nearly all federal law enforcement personnel, to efficiently procure equipment and supplies." On its website, the Georgia-based center says it trains law officers for 90 federal agencies and also officers in state, local, tribal, and international law enforcement. Chandler said that in the 12 months through September 2011, over 11,000 students at the center fired over 11 million rounds of .40 caliber ammunition, primarily in basic training. Chandler said earlier that Homeland Security oversees more than 135,000 weapons-carrying officers. Our calculation: If those officers go through all the possible 450 million rounds at the same rate each over five years -- admittedly, an unlikely balance -- each officer will have used about 667 bullets a year. Asked how the decision to purchase up to 450 million of the .40-caliber rounds compares to previous Homeland Security buys, Chandler said only that because the 2012 contract combines multiple previous contracts, it is different than "previous contract vehicles." Finally, we talked through the information provided by Homeland Security with Magers who said he believes the arranged-for rounds could be used by domestic law enforcement officers on duty, in training and in keeping their skills up. "Not only does every officer carry ammunition on their body and in close proximity, but every so often ... they are required to go out and qualify with that weapon. Any one officer is going to account for a lot of rounds in a year," Magers said. Also, he said, rounds get cycled out as officers ensure their equipment is ready when needed. "On its face, the type of ammunition and the amount of ammunition over a five-year period of time doesn’t sound extraordinarily excessive," Magers said. Of the chain email’s mention of a bullet for every man, woman and child, he said: "Whoever came up with this one bullet per person is trying to sensationalize this. That’s borderline irresponsible." Our ruling Homeland Security has contracted to buy up to 450 million .40-caliber bullets -- and that total exceeds the nation’s population. Significantly, though, the purchase contract covers five years; there’s no indication the agency is piling up the bullets in a hurry. More significantly, we found nothing to support the email’s ominous suggestions. Rather, the large size of the contract is explained as a way for the government to buy in bulk to save money on ammunition used routinely for training officers in a wide variety of agencies. We rate the email Mostly False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-04-30T06:00:00	2012-03-24	['United_States']

pomt-03995	"With the exception of slavery and the Chinese Exclusion Act, our laws have never barred persons from becoming citizens."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/08/zoe-lofgren/rep-zoe-lofgren-says-us-laws-have-rarely-barred-ac/	Rep. Zoe Lofgren says the United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants. During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Feb. 5, 2013, Lofgren, D-Calif., turned to the history books for perspective on the question of what status to grant newcomers to the United States. "What makes America special is that people come here, assimilate and become American with all of the rights and responsibilities citizenship bestows," Lofgren said. "With the exception of slavery and the Chinese Exclusion Act, our laws have never barred persons from becoming citizens, and we should not start now." Lofgren is an immigration lawyer and law professor, which made us that much more interested in checking out her claim that only twice in history has the U.S. "barred persons from becoming citizens." Lofgren’s examples As the debate over immigration reform cranks up, a key point of contention is citizenship vs. legal residence. On one side are those who favor an arduous checklist that, once completed, grants immigrants all the rights of natural-born Americans. Opponents call that amnesty and argue that immigrants should be limited to a status such as permanent legal residence. In the hearing, Lofgren warned that anything less than full citizenship could create a "permanent underclass," then mentioned slaves and Chinese immigrants. It’s clear from the context of the discussion that Lofgren was talking about ethnic groups in history who were subject to sweeping bans. But we would point out that even current law prohibits some groups of people from becoming U.S. citizens, namely those convicted of crimes. The law says applicants must be of "good moral character" who adhere to "the principles of the Constitution of the United States." "The ‘attached to constitutional principles’ (provision) is rarely invoked," said Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis. "It previously was used to bar communists, anarchists and sympathizers from naturalization. It also was invoked previously to bar Jehovah's Witnesses who rejected mandatory military service. Criminal convictions are the most likely modern exclusion for naturalization." Criminals aside, we are focusing in this fact-check on Lofgren’s claim regarding ethnic groups in history. Starting with slavery, it might seem self-evident that slaves were not considered citizens, but here’s a bit of background. Delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 clashed over how to count slaves for purposes of representation in Congress and distributing taxes. Southern slave owners wanted them counted, while Northern delegates argued to count only free people. They ultimately reached a compromise that three-fifths of the slave population would be considered for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. Even though their owners argued for slaves’ "personhood" in this conflict, in all other ways slaves were considered property, not people. Nearly 100 years later, the U.S. Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sanford provided some of the most explicit direction on the subject. Scott was a former slave who had moved to a free state and petitioned the court to grant him his freedom. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the opinion that slaves "were not intended to be included under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States." The decision was overturned in 1868 by the adoption of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which proclaimed citizenship for "all persons born or naturalized in the United States," regardless of race. Now, about the Chinese. About 20 years after the 14th Amendment was adopted, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 in reaction to the flood of Chinese immigrants drawn by the California gold rush. The act suspended immigration of Chinese laborers and required any who were already here to obtain certification to re-enter if they left the country. It also explicitly prevented state and federal courts from granting citizenship to Chinese resident aliens. What else? We asked several immigration historians if Lofgren’s statement was accurate and learned that it needs some clarification and additional information. Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota, pointed to the 1790 Naturalization Act as the first U.S. law to limit the rights of naturalized citizenship to "free, white men." We think that falls under the heading of slavery, as Lofgren mentioned, but it’s interesting to note that that law remained in effect until 1952. What’s more, Chinese immigrants were not the only group besides slaves to be blocked from citizenship. Bill Ong Hing, a law professor at the University of San Francisco and author of the book Making and Remaking Asian America Through Immigration Policy, 1850-1990, said the naturalization laws of 1870 were intended and later interpreted by the Supreme Court to bar all Asian immigrants from becoming U.S. citizens, not just the Chinese. "The law restricted naturalization to ‘white persons’ and people of ‘African descent,’" said Carl Bon Tempo, a history professor at the University of Albany. "This had the effect of barring certain persons from naturalizing as citizens – most importantly Asians. The Supreme Court, in fact, upheld this racialized naturalization process in the 1920s. In Ozawa v. U.S., the court ruled against the application for citizenship of a Japanese immigrant on the grounds of his race." Chinese were finally allowed to naturalize in 1943, Hing said, when the Exclusion Act was repealed; Filipinos and Asian Indians in 1946, and other Asians including Japanese in 1952. Our ruling Lofgren said that, "with the exception of slavery and the Chinese Exclusion Act, our laws have never barred persons from becoming citizens." Immigration experts told us that history is more complicated than Lofgren described, with the most important point being that other Asian groups were also targeted by federal immigration laws. Her statement is accurate but for that detail. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Zoe Lofgren	None	None	None	2013-02-08T18:00:19	2013-02-05	['None']
pomt-13884	The Orlando shooter used "a weapon of war."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/01/tammy-baldwin/was-gun-used-orlando-shooter-weapon-war/	In the aftermath of the shooting at an Orlando nightclub, Democratic politicians -- including U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin -- reignited the debate on gun control. Just a few days after the shooting at the nightclub that catered to the gay community, Baldwin, the first openly gay member of the Senate, appeared on the Wisconsin Public Television show Here and Now. "Now several days after this mass shooting in Orlando, as a member of the LGBTQ community, how are you processing what happened?" host Frederica Freyberg asked. "Oh it’s just horrific," Baldwin said. "It’s simply horrific. And you know I juxtapose the opportunity to kick off PrideFest in Milwaukee the Friday before the massacre and the celebration of how far we’ve come in the LGBT community to fight bullying, discrimination and violence turned on members of the LGBT community. "And then to wake up Sunday morning to this devastating, devastating news -- the worst gun violence in modern U.S. history," she continued. "And you know, to take in the fact that this was a U.S. citizen inspired by terrorists who legally purchased a weapon of war and turned it on the LGBT community." We’ve heard others use the phrase "weapon of war" to describe the guns used by mass shooters. So, we thought we’d find out if Baldwin is right. Does the military use the same weaponry the Orlando shooter did? Civilian vs. military guns The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had two firearms the night he killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a Florida nightclub -- a rifle and a 9mm handgun. Both were purchased legally. The rifle was a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic. That is what Baldwin meant when she cited "a weapon of war" and what we are looking at in this factcheck. Baldwin’s claim was a very stark one. While guns of many varieties may be used in battle, we view the phrase "a weapon of war" in this context to mean a gun used by the military. As backup, Baldwin’s team sent us to a couple news articles and gun reviews. The first news article, dated June 16, 2016, was from the Associated Press and carried the headline, "Rifle used in Orlando shooting was designed for military use." Her staff also pointed us to videos from the rifle’s manufacturer and highlighted some portions of the videos, including a point when Kevin Brittingham, president of the company’s silencer division, says "the Sig MCX was designed to meet the DOD (Department of Defense) requirement for a weapon that would be as compact as possible, that focused on signature reduction. (They) wanted something as quiet as possible and also wanted something that would engage targets out to 300 meters." But it’s not that simple. The article and the video don’t address the differences between the guns issued to soldiers and those sold to civilians. The Sig Sauer MCX rifle Mateen carried is a civilian version of the MCX-MR, a gun designed for military use. The MCX-MR was designed to comply with a Department of Defense requirement for a weapon to be carried by special operations units with low visibility in terms of size and noise. A backgrounder on the gun from the Violence Prevention Center sent to us by Baldwin’s team said, "there are no significant differences between them and military assault weapons." But Leigh Neville, a military researcher and author of the book "Guns of the Special Forces," said the two versions differ "fundamentally." The civilian MCX lacks three key design attributes that make the MCX-MR suitable for special operations use. 1. The civilian version is semiautomatic, rather than fully automatic. A semiautomatic gun fires one round of ammunition for every press of the trigger whereas a fully automatic gun fires a burst of rounds with every trigger press. 2. The civilian weapon does not feature a silencer, though one can be purchased and attached with separate approval. A special operations soldier would be issued a silencer with the rifle. 3. The civilian version does not have all the options for differing barrel lengths and shoulder stocks as the military version to make the guns lighter and easier to carry. The shorter barrel options, which decrease the speed at which the ammunition is propelled, would be illegal or restricted for civilians under federal laws. Weapons like the M16 and M4, the primary weapons used by United States military, do have these attributes. "If it was a weapon of war, it would be a machine gun," said Steven Howard, a competitive shooter and gun expert. "If a weapon of war is simply that it resembles a military firearm, then absolutely positively every weapon is a weapon of war." So, the gun used by Mateen isn’t really a military weapon. But not everyone agrees the differences are significant, arguing the killing power of civilian and military guns is similar and that there are many physical similarities as well. "Civilian semiautomatic assault weapons incorporate all of the anti-personnel features of design and function that make assault weapons so deadly," said Marty Langley, senior policy analyst with Violence Prevention Center. Langley and others note that the weapon Mateen used is also very different from guns typically used for, say, hunting. High-capacity ammunition magazines can be attached to guns like the MCX to hold extra rounds of ammunition. Additional grips like a forward grip or barrel shroud give shooters greater control for spray firing. In the end, guns like the one used by Mateen are more advanced than the typical civilian weapon but not quite military weapons. PolitiFact Florida rated a related claim from U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, about the power of guns like the one Mateen used. Grayson said the gun Mateen had "shoots off 700 rounds in a minute." Grayson was referring to an AR-15, another civilian weapon modeled after military weapons, in this case the M16. The M16 has a cyclic rate of fire, a theoretical measure, of 700 to 900 rounds per minute, according to U.S. Army documents. The "maximum effective rate of fire," the highest rate of fire that can still achieve target hits, is about 150-200 rounds per minute. But that’s much greater than what most mass shooters achieve with semiautomatic rifles. Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist, said that based on his research on mass shootings, most shooters rarely fire more than 50 rounds per minute. Grayson’s claim was rated Mostly False, as the weapon would need to be converted from an semiautomatic into an automatic weapon to even come close to shooting 700 rounds a minute. Our rating Baldwin said the Orlando shooter used "a weapon of war." Baldwin backed up her statement by showing that the gun Mateen had was originally designed for military use. But he had a civilian version of that gun that lacks key attributes of a military-style weapon. However, it’s also significantly different from weapons typically used by civilians for hunting.

pomt-03655	Says new Medicare billing guidelines "have nine codes for (injuries by) turkeys."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/30/ted-poe/rep-ted-poe-says-new-medicare-rules-require-nine-b/	Doctors’ offices, already burdened by federal billing bureaucracy, will soon find themselves pecked to death by new rules, Texas congressman Ted Poe says. New diagnosis codes required for reimbursement are so specific, he told Fox Business Network host John Stossel, there are a set of them just for injuries caused by turkeys. "Whether you run into a turkey or the turkey runs into you, you're pecked by a turkey or you're bitten by a turkey, there's a difference between being pecked and being bitten," he said in an interview April 25, 2013. "So they have nine codes for turkeys." Poe, a fifth-term Republican who’s a member of the Tea Party Caucus, argues doctors shouldn’t have to face the expense of complying with new rules or penalties for screwing up. "Do they need to go through this much detail to get information to the federal government? I don’t think they do," he said. We had to know: Do new Medicare billing guidelines include "nine codes for turkeys"? Outdated codes First, a little background about this code thing. It’s not just a U.S. system — it’s international. (And in case you were wondering, it has nothing to do with Obamacare.) The "new" set of diagnosis codes that Poe talked about is known as ICD-10. "ICD" stands for "International Classification of Diseases." It’s published by the World Health Organization, then adapted for use in the United States. The United States now uses ICD-9, which is more than three decades old. Doctors’ offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims, among other things. Their billing and practice management software is based on them. Their employees are trained to use them. The American Medical Association says that depending on the size of the medical practice, it’ll cost $83,290 to more than $2.7 million to switch. Doctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes, the association has begged since 2011 to delay or give up on the switch altogether. Other countries have charged ahead. They started to adopt the "new" set of codes nearly 20 years ago, and most developed countries now use it, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. CMS will require American doctors, indeed, any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA, to switch by Oct. 1, 2014. The federal government says the United States needs to upgrade partly because ICD-9 has outdated medical terms and not enough detail for accurate claims processing. Claims for two different injuries might seem like duplicate filings if you couldn’t specify right vs. left hand, for example. As Poe suggested, the new system does have far more diagnosis codes than the version developed in the 1970s — 68,000 instead of 13,000. (Poe, in his Stossel interview, said the new system has 140,000 codes, but that’s only if you group both diagnosis and procedure codes — not a direct comparison with 13,000.) How much detail are we talking? The codes allow doctors to specify not just injuries from turkeys, but from parrots, macaws, ducks and geese. There’s a different code for being "struck" vs. "pecked" or suffering from "other contact"— with specification for the first time, an unlucky repeat or even worse, "sequela." (That would be some "negative afteraffect" resulting from your turkey encounter. Headaches! Panic attacks!) Poe’s office pointed us to this: W61.4 Contact with turkey W61.42 Struck by turkey W61.42XA initial encounter W61.42XD subsequent encounter W61.42XS sequela W61.43 Pecked by turkey W61.43XA initial encounter W61.43XD subsequent encounter W61.43XS sequela W61.49 Other contact with turkey W61.49XA initial encounter W61.49XD subsequent encounter W61.49XS sequela If you’ve seen TV ads about the need to prepare for a bright new career in medical billing and coding — this is part of the reason why. Our ruling Poe said doctors face a new regulatory burden, requiring them to use a system that includes nine different codes for turkey injuries. His office pointed us to the new codes, which will be required for Medicare claims by October 2014. Indeed, if your Thanksgiving tradition takes a tragic turn that year, your doctor will be able to describe it in seven-digit detail. (We hope it’s just W61.42XA and not W61.43XS.)

pomt-00720	"There's no statistical evidence that" a waiting period for handgun purchases "reduces violence whatsoever."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/27/van-wanggaard/no-evidence-waiting-period-handgun-purchases-reduc/	Amid a surge in murderous gun violence in Milwaukee, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate voted to repeal a state law that requires a two-day wait for handgun purchases. Just before the April 21, 2015, vote, the author of the bill, state Sen. Van Wanggaard, made this waiting-period claim: "There’s no statistical evidence that it reduces violence whatsoever," the Racine Republican declared. With the repeal bill moving to the GOP-controlled Assembly, and likely headed for GOP Gov. Scott Walker, let’s see if Wanggaard is right. The law The District of Columbia and 10 states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa, have laws that require a waiting period for purchases of at least some types of guns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Wisconsin’s law, in place since 1976, applies only to handguns and only to purchases from firearms dealers. It prohibits a handgun buyer from taking possession of the weapon until 48 hours after a background check is started -- even if the check comes back clean within a matter of hours or minutes. The City of Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Wisconsin Medical Society are among groups that oppose scrapping the law. Some say the cooling-off period can help prevent crimes of passion, such as domestic violence. Under the repeal bill from Wanggaard, who is a retired Racine police traffic investigator, a buyer could take possession of a handgun as soon as the seller completes the background check. Groups backing the repeal include the National Rifle Association, the Milwaukee Police Association union and the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. Some say the wait following a successful background check is an "unnecessary time tax on both the purchaser and the dealer," and that a person who needs a gun for protection can be put at risk. Walker has indicated he supports the repeal. Asked about such a measure in February 2015, he told the NRA: "I think we want to be a leader in this area as well." Studies Here are highlights from some key studies about the effects of waiting-period laws: A study done by one researcher from Georgetown University and one from Duke University that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2000 examined the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a 1994 federal law that established a nationwide waiting period and background check for handgun sales. (The waiting period provision was later removed.) The study concluded that the law’s waiting period was associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for people age 55 and older, but not associated with reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates. Other research has found that people who buy handguns are at a higher risk of committing suicide during the first week after the purchase. For example, an article published in 2000 by members of the Firearm Injury Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin said a Wisconsin study found a "sharp increase" in the risk of suicide within one week of a gun purchase. But a 2003 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reviewed studies on the effects of waiting periods on violence found that some studies indicated a decrease in violent outcomes associated with the delay, while others indicated an increase. And a 2012 study by one researcher from the University of Cincinnati and another from Arizona State University found no statistical effects from waiting periods on gun crimes. In a nutshell, except for suicide, the studies show Wanggaard’s claim about waiting periods and violence is largely correct. Experts Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us there is research linking more thorough background checks -- which take longer than an instant FBI check -- with reduced homicide rates. The more thorough checks are more likely to turn up reasons why a person cannot legally purchase a gun. But Webster said he is not aware of research that shows waiting periods reduce violence. Similarly, Harvard’s David Hemenway said he was aware only of research that links lower suicide rates with wait periods. Many studies link lower levels of lethal violence with strong gun control laws in general, but not with particular laws such as a waiting period, he said. Our rating Wanggaard said, "There’s no statistical evidence that" a waiting period for handgun purchases "reduces violence whatsoever." There is research to indicate that handgun waiting periods are linked with lower suicide rates. But we did not find evidence that waiting periods coincide with less violence being committed by one person against another. If such evidence emerges, we may revisit this item. As it stands, Wanggaard’s statement is accurate but needs clarification -- our definition of Mostly True.	None	Van Wanggaard	None	None	None	2015-04-27T05:00:00	2015-04-21	['None']
pomt-06140	"No federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-no-federal-official-allowed-say/	Newt Gingrich says the nation's obsession with being politically correct has come to this: Federal officials aren't allowed to say "Merry Christmas." On the campaign trail, Gingrich has offered strong criticism of efforts to keep religion out of public places and said he would hold judges to account if they rule in favor of stricter separation between church and state. The topic came up in Davenport, Iowa, on Dec. 19, 2011. The question wasn’t audible on a video clip, but here's Gingrich's reply: "This is actually weird . . . I’ve been investigating this for the last three days. I am told that this is actually a 20- or 30-year-old law, which I have to say I find strange, and I would advocate repealing the law. Apparently if the president sends out Christmas cards, they are paid for the Democratic or Republican National Committees because no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’ And the idea, I think, is that the government should be neutral. … I'm going to go back and find out how was this law written, when was it passed. We’ve had this whole — in my mind — very destructive attitude in the last 50 years that we have to drive religion out of public life." A reader brought this to our attention, so we decided to look into whether Gingrich is right that "no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’" First off, we’ll grant a little leeway in Gingrich’s wording. The United States government does not, as a general matter, monitor and control employees' private conversations, so we’ll assume that Gingrich isn't suggesting that if a federal bureaucrat is in the comfort of their home, they can't wish a neighbor "Merry Christmas." But what about in the workplace? If a federal worker wishes to say that to a colleague, do they get reprimanded? To explore this, we examined federal rules, spoke with labor unions that represent government workers and interviewed lawyers with expertise in federal rules. The upshot: It's perfectly acceptable to say "Merry Christmas!" (Or "Happy Hanukkah!") We started with "Memorandum on Religious Exercise and Religious Expression in the Federal Workplace," issued Aug. 14, 1997, by President Bill Clinton. We found the rule was respectful of employees' rights to express their religious preference: "First, agencies shall permit employees to engage in personal religious expression (as they must permit other constitutionally valued expression) to the greatest extent possible, consistent with interests in workplace efficiency and requirements of law. Of course, the workplace is for work, and an agency may restrict any speech that truly interferes with its ability to perform public services. In addition, an agency may have a legal obligation to restrict certain forms of speech that intrude unduly on the legitimate rights of others. But when an agency allows nonreligious speech, because that speech does not impinge on these interests, an agency also usually must allow otherwise similar speech of a religious nature. The one exception to this principle of neutrality—an exception mandated by the Establishment Clause—is when religious speech would lead a reasonable observer to conclude that the Government is endorsing religion. Subject to this exception, an agency may not typically subject religious speech to greater restrictions than other speech entitled to full constitutional protection, and therefore should allow much of this speech to go forward." While there is some gray area in that passage, there’s nothing as sweeping as Gingrich claims, said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in church-state issues. Indeed, the more detailed rules affiliated with this memorandum suggest quite the opposite. Among the theoretical examples provided is this one: "At Christmas time, a supervisor places a wreath over the entrance to the office's main reception area. This course of conduct is permitted." Laycock added that "there is no such law anywhere in the United States Code. There is no such regulation of sufficient status to appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. I am certain of these two facts, because they are both computer-searchable. … It is hard to imagine a rule that applies to every ‘federal official at any level’ not appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations." Richard W. Garnett, a University of Notre Dame law professor and another specialist in church-state issues, agreed. "I’m not aware of any general prohibition on federal workers, in private or on the job, saying the words, 'Merry Christmas.' " We also checked with the American Federation of Government Employees, a labor union for federal workers. A spokeswoman said she checked with the union’s legal staff and they confirmed the view that federal workers are allowed to say "Merry Christmas." John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a group that promotes careers in government, said the notion that "any other federal official is prohibited by law from saying ‘Merry Christmas’ is absurd." So where did Gingrich’s falsehood come from? The Gingrich campaign hasn't been responding to our inquiries, but it appears to be rooted in two things -- the White House tradition of using political parties to pay for the White House Christmas card, and the rules for congressional postage. On White House Christmas cards, Gingrich has a point. The White House has long avoided the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for the Christmas cards it sends out, said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written about the issue. Instead, political party committees foot the bill. But this appears to be a longstanding custom that began decades ago out of an abundance of caution, not because federal law bans the practice outright. The legal concerns that prompted the initial decision may have involved "the separation of church and state, as well as concerns that the holiday cards would be viewed as political in nature, possibly implicating laws against the use of federal funds for campaign purposes," said Robert K. Kelner, a lawyer who specializes in political and election law at the firm Covington & Burling. Joe Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said that "in recent years, the White House cards have been generally nonsectarian in character, probably because candidates of both parties happily take contributions from donors of all faiths and none. And they don’t want to turn off any potential contributors." We checked transcripts of speeches by federal officials and quickly found plenty of examples of Christmas wishes: • "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" -- President Barack Obama, Dec. 1, 2011 • "Merry Christmas and happy holidays, everybody." -- Obama, Dec. 13, 2010 • "Merry Christmas to my constituents, as I’ve said, and Merry Christmas to our first family and all that they have done for America." -- Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, Dec. 16, 2009 • "Merry Christmas to everyone. I reserve the balance of my time." -- U.S. Rep. Dean Heller, R-Nev., Dec. 16, 2009 Gingrich's more sweeping claim fits into the annual complaint by Fox News commentators and other conservatives that there is a "war on Christmas." This year, a column in the conservative Washington Examiner said the U.S. House of Representatives has banned "wishing constituents a ‘Merry Christmas’ if they want to do so in a mailing paid for with tax dollars." Mark Tapscott, who edits the newspaper’s editorial page, wrote that "Members who submit official mailings for review by the congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it can be ‘franked,’ or paid for with tax dollars, are being told that no holiday greetings, including ‘Merry Christmas,’ can be sent in official mail." Tapscott quoted a Capitol Hill staffer who requested anonymity saying, "I called the commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also told cannot say 'Happy New Year' but can say 'have a happy new year' – referencing the time period of a new year, but not the holiday." The column goes on to cite a Dec. 12, 2011, memo from the "Franking Commission Staff" concerning "Holiday Messaging." According to the column, the memo said that examples of "nonfrankable items" include "birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages and holiday greetings. … You may make reference to the season as a whole using language along the lines of, 'Have a safe and happy holiday season.' It may only be incidental to the piece rather than the primary purpose of the communication." (This rule was subsequently mocked by Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly here.) We weren’t able to independently obtain the memo from the House Administration committee, nor speak to a spokesperson for the committee. But we did look up the House’s official franking rulebook at the committee’s website, and it closely follows the language of the memo obtained by the Examiner, saying that "birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages and holiday greetings are prohibited." We also checked the Senate guidelines, which are broadly similar. The Senate "prohibits the use of the frank for ‘any card expressing holiday greetings from (a Senator).’ This prohibition extends to acknowledgments of holiday greetings sent to a Senator, but does not preclude an expression of holiday greetings at the commencement or conclusion of otherwise frankable correspondence." So both the House and Senate -- whose employees are federal workers -- do restrict the use of taxpayer funds for sending out holiday cards, as well as birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement and condolence cards. So this is not a war on Christmas. It's more like a war on … greeting cards. From that rule, it's a ridiculous leap to Gingrich’s claim that "no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’" Here’s the kicker: The House regulations that sparked Gingrich’s outrage are dated June 1998, when the House Speaker was … Newt Gingrich. And the present Republican speaker, John Boehner of Ohio, was on the committee that directly wrote the rules. Our rating While it’s true that the intersection of religion, the workplace, and the federal government is legally tricky due to issues surrounding the separation of church and state, it is ridiculously false to say that "no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’" Guidelines in force for the past 15 years give substantial freedom for personal religious expression in the federal workplace, and neither those guidelines nor federal law includes anything like an outright ban on a federal official saying, "Merry Christmas." The closest Gingrich comes to accuracy is that Congress does bar taxpayer-funded official mailings of all types of cards. However, such rules affect only one class of federal employees (those who serve in Congress); the rules are only about postage (lawmakers are free to send cards on their own dime); and it certainly does not abridge the right of any Member of Congress or congressional employee to speak the words "Merry Christmas."

pomt-07041	"The Federal Register - which houses all Washington regulations - is 34,000 pages in length and weighs in at more than 340 pounds."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/01/randy-forbes/rep-forbes-says-federal-registration-containing-re/	For Rep. Randy Forbes, government regulation is truly a weighty issue. "Over the past several years, increasing and complex government regulations have stifled business creation and hindered jobs growth," Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a recent blog post. "The Federal Register - which houses all Washington regulations - is 34,000 pages in length and weighs in at more than 340 pounds," the congressman said. The Federal Register, which lists government agencies’ new regulations, proposed rules, and presidential papers, comes out every business day. The National Archives and Records Administration, which helps compile the document, dubs it the "daily newspaper of the federal government." Published on recycled newsprint, it looks like a 8.5-by-11 inch technical manual. Does it really contain 34,000 pages and weigh more than 340 pounds? We asked Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, for the sources of the congressman’s claim. Let’s start with the page count. Hack sent us a link to a Government Printing Office synopsis of the June 14, 2011 Federal Register, which was published the day Forbes made his claim. The table of contents shows the Federal Register at the end of that day -- not including its table of contents and indexes -- was 34,844 pages. That’s close to what Forbes cited. The figure is actually the running tally of the number of pages of the register published so far in 2011. Each daily edition is a couple hundred pages. As each business day passes, the size of the annual Federal Register increases. In 2010, the register totaled 81,405 pages, said Jim Hemphill, the special assistant to the director of the Federal Register. Although most Americans probably haven’t heard of the register, it's a resource to lawyers, journalists and special interest groups trying to keep tabs on regulations. U.S. agencies use it to publish proposed regulations and solicit public comments on them. So how much does the Federal Register weigh? Although Hemphill could readily provide its size in pages, he wasn’t aware of anyone ever trying to measure it by the pound. Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, provided the formula his boss used to back up his claim that the register would tip the scale at more than 340 pounds. He sent us a link to a website from an agency within the Department of Energy that states a 500-sheet ream of standard office paper weighs 5 pounds. That means if you print it out, the 34,000 pages of the Federal Register would require 68 reams of paper, which would weigh a total of 340 pounds, Hack said. Actual PDF copies of each daily Federal Register are available on the National Archives website and can be printed out. If that was done with each page printed on a single sheet of paper, it would come out to the weight that Forbes cited. But there’s a critical flaw in the congressman’s calculations. The published copy of the Federal Register prints pages on both the front and back of each sheet of paper. So the 34,000 pages would be published on 17,000 sheets. Therefore the weight would be less than 340 pounds. We were not in a position to haul 34,000 of pages of the register to a scale, so we devised a way to estimate the register’s weight. We went to the Library of Virginia, got a copy of the May 11, 2011 edition, and asked a librarian to weigh it in the the mail room. The 399-page edition -- complete with a title page, table of contents and index -- came in at 1 pound, 3 ounces. We then turned to an overall tally of all daily Federal Registers for 2011 up to and including June 14 - the day Forbes made his statement. When we included the pages for tables of contents, title page and index for each daily edition we found there have been about 35,850 pages published so far this year. With every 399 pages coming out to 1 pound, 3 ounces, that means that those nearly 36,000 pages would weigh about 106.7 pounds - less than a third of the weight Forbes cited. So Forbes was close on the overall page count - actually underestimating it - but wrong on the weight total. Let’s turn to Forbes’ implication, that all those pages are evidence of regulation run amok. The register’s annual page count over the past 20 years had generally been on the rise. But there’s disagreement on whether its growth is a meaningful gauge of government oversight. "I think as a very broad measure it indicates that there is more regulatory activity now than in the past," said James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "It’s the most popular measure people cite." But Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, is dismissive of linking the register’s size to the amount of regulations. Not everything published in the document, he noted, are regulations. "So the GSA (General Services Administration) says we need an office building and it needs to be built by these specs. All that’s in the Federal Register. That’s not what I think people mean by calling something ’regulations,’" Van Doren said. "Depending on one’s politics and one’s views ... people use the number of pages in the Federal Register as a weapon in political discourse." Of the 81,405 pages published in 2010, 46,758 were dedicated to rules or proposed rules. Another 34,306 pages contained notices of federal agency hearings, meetings, investigations, decisions and the like. And 611 pages were presidential documents - things like executive orders and presidential proclamations. To recap: To argue that regulation is out of control, Forbes said the Federal Register came to 34,000 pages and weighed 340 pounds. The congressman was close on the number of pages, slightly underestimating them. But he greatly overstated the Federal Register’s weight by failing to realize that its pages are printed on both sides of paper. And we would point out that less than 60 percent of the register’s pages last year contained regulations. We rate Forbes’ claim Half True.

The need for food assistance has increased dramatically since 2008 because of the recession, she said, but it was growing already over the past decade as the number of Ohioans in poverty jumped almost 50 percent. She told the hearing -- which was called over a report by the Government Accountability Office on potential duplication of federal programs -- that economic recovery should make little difference, because her agency has not seen a correlation between the state of the national economy and people receiving food aid in Ohio. "No, unfortunately, we haven't," she said. Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, interrupted in surprise: "But when the economy improves which we all hope it does sooner rather than later, you don't anticipate any less participants in your program?" "I don't," Hamler-Fugitt said. "And if you just look at the data, Ohio currently ranks 50th out of all states in income growth." PolitiFact Ohio knew times were tough, but we did not expect to find Ohio running dead last. Hamler-Fugitt cited an analysis based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that looked at income growth over the past 50 years. Specifically, the analysis looked at data on disposable income, which is defined as all money earned by all residents of a state in a given year, minus all income taxes and property taxes. Over the last 50 years, the nation’s disposable income grew at an annual rate of 7.1 percent. Nevada’s income growth rate, 10.1 percent, was easily the nation's highest. Arizona was the only other state above 9 percent. Florida, Texas and Colorado rounded out the top five. Industrial states in the Northeast and Midwest fared the worst, according to the analysis, posted online by The Business Journals. Ohio’s 5.9 percent per year rate of growth was the slowest. Michigan and New York were only slightly better. Ohio actually ranked 51st in the analysis, which also included the District of Columbia. That snapshot looked at Ohio’s performance over 50 years. The state didn’t fare much better in other time frames. Related figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, for example, show Ohio’s growth in personal income in 2010 was below the national average of 3.0 percent. It’s 2.7 percent rate ranked 34th in the nation. Nevada's growth in personal income in 2010, incidentally, was actually last in the nation at 0.3 percent. The most recent available figures from the U.S. Census Bureau also put Ohio in the bottom half of states in personal income per person (33rd) and in median household income (31st). What does it add up to? An analysis of data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis supports Hamler-Fugitt’s statement on income growth. That analysis covers a 50-year period. And while Ohio didn’t rank last using other gauges, the state does land in the bottom half. Those pieces of information provide clarification and context.

"If a petition meets the signature threshold," the site says, "it will be reviewed by the Administration and we will issue a response." One of the fastest-drawing and most-signed petitions, of 137 posted on Nov. 14, is a call to "recount the election." Created on Nov. 10, the petition says: "It has become blatantly obvious the voter fraud that was committed during the 2012 Presidential elections. In one county alone in Ohio, which was a battleground state, President Obama received 106,258 votes. But there were only 98,213 eligible voters. It's not humanly possible to get 108 percent of the vote!" That drew the interest of PolitiFact Ohio. We had heard a radio host in Youngstown make the same unattributed statement, that Obama "received 108 percent of the vote" in one Ohio county. We wondered about the basis and source of the claim. Election returns posted on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted showed no county in which Obama received 106,258 votes, or similar number. Less surprisingly, it showed that the vote for Obama nowhere exceeded the number of voters. PolitiFact Ohio did a search on Google hoping to find the origin of the claim and discovered it was a twist on numerous blog postings, many of them worded identically, making the odd assertion that Obama "won the majority of Wood County's 108 percent of registered voters." A number of those postings cited as their source a Nov. 9 posting on the right-leaning blog frontpagemag.com. Its headline reads: "Voter Fraud: Obama Won %108 [sic] of Registered Voters in Ohio County." The text says: "Mr. Obama won Wood County in Ohio this year. That’s right, Mr. Obama won the majority of Wood County’s 108 percent of registered voters. That’s not a typo. "In 2012, 106,258 people in Wood County are registered to vote out of an eligible 98,213. ... Mr. Obama did indeed win Wood County, along with its 108 percent of voters." The stated conclusion is "voter fraud." But the posting, once you untangle the meaning of its numbers, actually touches on a situation well known to election officials and observers: outdated registration rolls that include inactive and ineligible voters. Purging the rolls "Inactive" voters generally are those who have gone more than four years without voting, have moved to another jurisdiction or have died. Under federal law, voters can't be removed from the rolls until it is confirmed they have moved, until there is confirmation of a death or if they have gone without voting for more than four years, or two federal election cycles. Problems with inaccurate or invalid records plague voter registration rolls nationwide, according to a report issued last February by the non-partisan Pew Center on the States. No evidence of voter fraud was found -- just record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. In Ohio, flaws in maintaining the voter database were cited as a prime reason the state has one of the highest rates of provisional voting in the country. Provisional ballots are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility, which happens most often because of a change of address. Ohio law requires voters to provide proof of identity and current address at polling places. An analysis by The Columbus Dispatch in September found that more than one out of every five registered Ohio voters is probably ineligible to vote. A look at the numbers The blog posting's count of people eligible to vote in Wood County -- 98,213 -- is the 2010 census count of the population age 18 and over. The posting's count of registered voters, 106,258, matches a Plain Dealer tally of Sept. 17. The latest number of registered voters in Wood County is 108,014, Board of Elections director Terry Burton told PolitiFact Ohio. Of those, only 80,433 are active voters, he said -- "and the difference between those numbers is the inactive voters." Why such a large gap? The presence of Bowling Green State University in "is one of the big things that does play into it," Burton said, and the majority of inactive voters are in the Bowling Green area. The big reason is students who register to vote there and then move without notifying the elections board. "Most students typically don't contact us and let us know when they're leaving," Burton said. "We do carry a significant portion of students. And there is the transient nature of the administration and faculty as well." The university also can skew the voting-age population, he said, since out-of-county students who register to vote there are not necessarily included in the county's census count. Meanwhile, Burton said, the "community-minded" rural areas that make up much of Wood County have high levels of active voter registration. "The actual voting numbers are what you would expect," he said. Wood County's total on Nov. 6 was 62,338 votes, he said, for a turnout of about 57 percent of registered voters. Not only is that far below 108 percent -- it's well below the statewide turnout of about 68 percent reported by the secretary of state. Obama's total in Wood County -- 31,596 votes, or about 51 percent of those cast -- was lower than his 2008 tally, according election night totals from the secretary of state. Mitt Romney received 28,997 votes, or about 47 percent -- less than John McCain's 2008 total. "Now that we've gotten by Nov. 6, we can go back and recheck the database for voters who missed two consecutive federal elections," Burton said. "This issue is something the secretary of state's office has been working on with us. It isn't a hidden issue." Voter registration nationally averages about 70 percent of the eligible population. The Dispatch analysis found that Wood County is one of two in Ohio where the number of registered voters actually exceeds the voting-age population. The other is Lawrence County, where Romney won about 57 percent of the vote to Obama's 41 percent. Both counties topped what The Columbus Dispatch called the "dirty dozen voter rolls" -- a list of a dozen counties where voter registration equals at least 95 percent of the voting-age population. Romney won all of them except Wood County. What's our tally? The much-cited blog post referring to "108 percent of registered voters" is muddled and misleading. It makes a claim of fraud using a registration figure that is known to include inactive and ineligible voters -- who would be identified at the polls -- while ignoring the actual vote. But the "We the People" petition, which gathered more than 53,000 signatures in four days, is even worse. Posted to a public forum on the White House’s web site, it more forcefully takes up the cause, making a claim that voter fraud is "blatantly obvious" and that Obama received 106,258 votes in Wood County. That quoted figure isn’t even a figure for votes. It’s a total for registered voters in that county. The actual votes cast for both Obama and Romney combined amount to about 57 percent of that number, a figure easily checked. The petition's claim that Obama somehow managed to collect that many votes is not only demonstrably false, it's ridiculous. The Truth-O-Meter has a rating for that: Pants on Fire!

pomt-14565	"We’re spending tremendous amounts of money to educate our kids. In the world, we're No. 1 per pupil by a factor of four."	mostly false	/iowa/statements/2016/feb/09/donald-trump/trump-claim-united-states-spends-most-education/	As Donald Trump speechified his way through Iowa auditoriums and gyms to his No. 2 finish in the Republican caucuses, he made a lot of claims in a lot of places. Many of those reinforced a central theme: Professional politicians are failing and President Trump’s business and personal savvy would be the antidote. His claim that the United States outspends other countries on K-12 education by a "factor of four" was part of that narrative. And it caught our attention. "We spend more money than anyone else any other country in the world by a lot," he went on to say. "And yet we're number 28 on the list … So we're 28 in terms of quality. So that means we have 27 countries ahead of us, and yet in terms of cost we're No. 1 by far." Spending that out-of-proportion to results would throw serious doubt on proposals to boost education budgets, so we decided to check it out. Breaking it down We reached out to Trump’s campaign, but they didn't respond. We consulted data collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — an international organization of 34 developed countries — and by the United Nations. Researchers and policymakers from groups across the political spectrum told us they put the most stock in OECD data, which includes spending from both government and private sources. Based on 2012 data, the OECD shows that the United States has generous education budgets, spending about 50 percent more than the average OECD country. But relative to the nation’s overall wealth, the United States was at the middle of the pack. Relative to the size of the economy or overall government spending, U.S. levels were within 1 percent of the OECD average. Additionally, the United States was not the top spender. Luxembourg, Switzerland and Norway each spent more per pupil than the United States. In the case of Luxembourg, about 66 percent more per secondary school student. And similar UN data puts the United States eighth among all countries, behind several other developed countries and Macau, a semi-autonomous city inside China. We looked at a variety of other ways to crunch the numbers, but the United States never rose above No. 4. (see table) That was true even if figures were adjusted for purchasing power, the difference in what $1 buys from country to country. In fact, the United States would have to increase per student spending about $8,000 per year just to match Luxembourg at the high school level. To spend quadruple what Luxembourgers do would require a $70,000 per student boost. U.S. ranking in spending Rank Amount Above average by Below #1 by Below four times #1 by Per student per year (including college) 4 $15,494 51% $7,051 $74,685 Per student primary school 4 $11,030 30% $8,990 $69,050 Per student secondary school 5 $12,442 33% $8,175 $70,026 As percent of GDP 15 4.8% — 2.9% 26% As percent of government spending 14 11.6% — 6.8% 62% Source: OECD Educational achievement So what about us scoring "No. 28" among countries in education? There is ample evidence suggesting that U.S. educational performance is sub-par. For instance, the OECD rated the U.S. 23rd out of the 25 countries for the percent of current students going on to pursue higher education. U.S. students were also 30th in math proficiency worldwide according to an OECD test. Meanwhile U.S. students were about average among developed countries for reading science. Or as Jason Bedrick, a policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, put it: "The U.S. definitely spends more than most other industrialized nations and has less to show for it." Our rating Trump said the United States spends more on education per pupil by a factor of four and gets poor results. There is good evidence to support his overall idea, that the United States gets less bang for its education buck than other developed countries. But Trump overstated U.S. spending by 500 percent. We’re not No. 1 in spending, by several different ways of measuring. His comments suggest the country won the gold medal in spending when it’s actually just shy of a bronze.

pomt-00828	Liberty University students "were mandated" to attend Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential announcement "or they would be fined."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/25/jess-mcintosh/liberty-u-students-faced-fine-if-they-skipped-cruz/	Every politician likes a packed house, and when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced that he was officially running for president this week, he got one. About 11,000 students at Liberty University in Virginia were on hand when Cruz came to their campus. But as Jess McIntosh, the spokeswoman for the abortion rights group Emily’s List noted, they weren’t there necessarily by choice. "Students were mandated to be in attendance or they would be fined," McIntosh told Chris Hayes on MSNBC on March 24, 2015. "Not as much as they would be fined for possessing R-rated movies or practicing witchcraft, but still, they had to pay money if they didn’t want to see him." McIntosh wasn’t the only person to make this point, and a reader asked us to see what was up at Liberty University. In this case, McIntosh gets an A for accuracy, although there was no special rule related to Cruz. The university, founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell, requires its 13,500 residential students to attend as many as three events each week as part of a program called Convocation. There are sermons by guest pastors, performances from Christian entertainers and talks by leaders in many fields. What happens if you don’t go? The university’s student appeals court handbook has the list of consequences for various infractions. Missing Convocation is on the list. (A reprimand is a formal mark against a student’s record.) Here’s what the handbook says: Each student should be familiar with these sanctions. 1 Reprimand: Late for curfew (1 additional reprimand for each 30 minutes late) Late for Convocation (1 additional reprimand for each 15 minutes late) 4 Reprimands + $10.00 Fine: Absence from required meeting (Convocation, etc.) Disturbance/non-participation during Convocation Dress/hair code violation (male or female) Cruz’s presidential announcement was scheduled as a Convocation event by the university, therefore the penalty for a student’s absence would be four reprimands and a $10 fine. Liberty University issued a statement about Cruz’s speech that confirmed that "missing Convocation is only a minor penalty, a $10 fine." University President Jerry Falwell Jr. addressed the Convocation requirement in a separate statement after Cruz’s address. "Convocation speakers do not all line up with traditional Evangelical Christian viewpoints or even Liberty University’s doctrinal statement. A fundamental part of the college experience is being exposed to a variety of viewpoints so students can better understand why they hold their own beliefs and be better prepared to defend them." Students were aware of the rule. One of them posted about it on her Facebook page. Citing another student, she wrote, "Students will either attend Convocation and lend to the illusion of widespread support for Sen. Cruz, or they will be subject to administrative punishment -- specifically, four reprimands and a $10 fine -- if they are absent." We have plenty of questions about the fine system, but Liberty University officials didn’t get back to us before our deadline. Among our unanswered questions: If the crowd at Cruz’s announcement was 11,000 -- as reported by Liberty -- does that mean at least 2,500 students skipped the event and are subject to a fine? How does Liberty University take attendance? (We did find this seating chart that might begin to explain that question.) How many attendance fines were issued in 2014, or any other period of time? (Update: After our fact-check published, students and alumni helped us fill in some of these details. You can read more here.) Incidentally, McIntosh is also correct about the greater sanctions for worse offenses. There’s a penalty on the books of 12 reprimands and a $50 fine for seeing an R-rated movie, deception, and participating in an unauthorized petition or demonstration. Participating in a seance, witchcraft or other demonic activity carries a $500 fine, 30 hours of community service, 30 reprimands and possible expulsion. Our ruling McIntosh said Liberty University students "were mandated" to attend Cruz’s presidential announcement "or they would be fined." Cruz’s speech was part of a regular program at the university called Convocation. By the letter of the law, students are required to attend or pay a $10 fine. The private university wouldn’t tell us if they issued any fines to students skipping Cruz’s speech, how the system works and how often fines are issued. McIntosh’s claim is accurate. We rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7d89e040-a355-44b4-b87d-42b1a7777f82	None	Jess McIntosh	None	None	None	2015-03-25T18:01:52	2015-03-24	['Ted_Cruz']
pomt-04084	"The average age of first marijuana use is 12."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/20/protect-families-first/protect-families-first-claims-children-typically-t/	Former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., recently organized a national group to oppose the legalization of marijuana. Project SAM, for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, also calls for limiting medical marijuana use to non-smoked forms of the drug. After the launch of Project SAM, a Providence group called Protect Families First took issue with some of Kennedy’s positions. Protect Families First, which says it supports "progressive family values including pro-family marijuana reform," agreed with Kennedy on the need to increase resources for treatment of drug abuse and prevention. But the group says it supports strictly regulating, not prohibiting, marijuana use. The organization also asserted that Kennedy’s position does not address the problem of children’s access to drugs. In a news release issued Jan. 10 -- the same day Project SAM was announced in Denver -- Protect Families First listed several statistics, including this one: "The average age of first marijuana use is 12, the lowest ever and still declining." That would mean a fair number of kids even younger than 12 are toking up. We wondered whether it was true. We contacted Protect Families First, whose executive director, Rebecca McGoldrick, checked the information and sent an e-mail later that day saying the statement was wrong. She said a research intern had gotten confused about the numbers. McGoldrick provided what she said were corrected statistics, citing a couple of studies. One, a national survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency created by Congress in 1992 to reduce impact of substance abuse and mental illness on communities, found the average age of first use of marijuana among people ages 12 to 49 was 17.5 years of age in 2011. Even though it was clear Protect Families First had made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources. We examined several studies, including some that indicated an increase in marijuana use among young people over the past few years. Monitoring the Future, a project run at the University of Michigan, has surveyed about 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th graders in the United States annually since the 1970s about various issues, including drug use. It found that more in the 2000s reported trying marijuana during middle school than in the late 1990s, but the percentages fluctuate. In the 2010 survey, 26 percent of young people said they first smoked marijuana or hashish as high school freshmen. Second to that was the 21.6 percent who said they first smoked it in "grade 7 or 8" -- about ages 12 to 14. Another report, by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that only 8.1 percent of students nationally first tried marijuana "before age 13 years." And the Rhode Island Department of Health’s latest health risk survey, from 2011, found that 7.1 percent of Rhode Island high school students reported having tried marijuana before age 13. Our ruling Protect Families First said in a news release that "the average age of first marijuana use is 12, the lowest ever and still declining," a statement that grabbed our attention because it seemed so unlikely. After we called them, the organization said that figure was in error. And none of the studies we found suggested that 12 was the average age for first marijuana use. We rate the claim False.

Smith."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/06/naha-daily/fox-news-wrong-picture-stuart-scott-espn/	Put this in the category of nipping a rumor in the bud. On Sunday, Jan. 4, ESPN announced that longtime host Stuart Scott died after a long fight with cancer. The website NaHaDaily responded by posting a story that claimed Fox News had botched the photo that accompanied its coverage of Scott’s death. "Stuart Scott succumbed to cancer at the age of 49 and Fox News television ran a tribute today in his memory, but instead released a picture of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith," NaHaDaily wrote. Both men are African-American. The item included what appears to be a Fox News Facebook page comment, "You know all famous black people look-a-like. No harm, no foul." This hoax image appears on the NaHaDaily Facebook page: There is no truth to the NaHaDaily article. Fox News discussed Scott’s passing on air, which included many videos of Scott (and none of Smith). The rumor debunking website Snopes reached the same conclusion previously. NaHaDaily includes a line at the bottom of its Web page, below the comments and copious ads, "NahaDaily is a daily satirical news source. Meaning complete fiction." The item clearly misled some readers. On Twitter, users reacted to the fake news. Here’s a sampling: "@FoxNews SO FOXNEWS IS REALLY SAD AND STUPID." "Fox News did Stuart Scott dirty. And Stephen Smith. How do you give a man a tribune... Via the face of another man, that's alive?" "They really put up a picture of Stephen A. Smith and said RIP Stuart Scott." "@FoxNews Know the difference between Stephen A. Smith ,..and Stuart Scott yet? You Idiots." One comment on the NaHaDaily page said there ought to be a law that requires a disclaimer at the very top of each Web page.

pomt-14062	"When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-approval-rating-secretary-state-w/	The 2016 presidential race may come down to a contest where the least unpopular candidate wins, with Democrat Hillary Clinton just three percentage points ahead of Republican Donald Trump in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Both candidates have extraordinarily high disapproval ratings, a fact mentioned by Chuck Todd when he interviewed Clinton during the May 22 edition of Meet the Press. He wanted to know how she would get past her negative numbers. Clinton argued that once she gets on a job, whether it's first lady, U.S. senator or secretary of state, she gets things done. "So I have a track record. And I'm going to remind people of that. Because it's not just rhetoric, for me," she said. "When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating, as you can go back and check. Because I was doing a job that people could see." The latest NBC News poll shows that 54 percent of registered voters have a negative or somewhat negative opinion of Clinton. Trump scores a bit worse at 58 percent. Only 34 percent view Clinton positively. We wondered if her rating was really very high when she served as secretary of state from January 2009 through Feb. 1, 2013. Clinton's favorability rating has ebbed and flowed during her two and a half decades on the national political scene. Gallup pegged it as low as 38 percent when her husband ran for president in 1992, but the polling firm has said that's because she was wasn't well known. It peaked at 62 percent during her first years as first lady, dropped to 43 percent in 1996 during the "Travelgate" investigation, and spiked to its highest point ever — 67 percent — in December 1998 when her husband was impeached for perjury in the wake of scandals involving Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones. By the time she left the White House in 2001, Clinton's Gallup rating was down to 44 percent. Her polling numbers started going up during her time in the Senate and hit another peak of 58 percent in 2007 while a senator and just after announcing she would run for president, according to Gallup. After another dip, it shot up to 65 percent in 2009 when she became secretary of state and stayed high for most of her tenure. In two polls taken in 2011 and 2012, she was viewed favorably by 66 percent, making her more popular than President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. When she left that position on Feb. 1, 2013, 64 percent had a favorable view of her. Her rating has since declined in the wake of criticism over security at the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and controversy over how she handled her emails. Clinton's campaign pointed us to other polling data. A Washington Post-ABC News poll put her favorability at 67 percent as she was winding down as secretary of state and preparing to testify in a Benghazi hearing. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted at the same time put her approval rating at 69 percent. Are these percentages "very high," as Clinton characterized them on Meet the Press? To get some perspective on how easy it is to get an approval rating that high, we consulted Gallup's Presidential Job Approval Center which goes back to Harry Truman and lists overall favorability ratings, along with highs and lows. In this context, Clinton’s highest numbers were relatively strong. Of the dozen presidents, the six with the highest overall averages are: John Kennedy (average: 70.1; range: 56 to 83) Dwight Eisenhower (average: 65 percent; range: 48 to 79) George H. W. Bush (average: 60.9 percent; range: 29 to 89) Lyndon Johnson (average: 55.1 percent; range: 35 to 79) Bill Clinton (average: 55.1 percent; range: 37 to 73) Ronald Reagan (average: 52.8 percent; range: 35 to 68) Clinton also polls well compared to recent secretary of states, according to Gallup. Condoleezza Rice's scores ranged from 59 percent to 63 percent during the George W. Bush administration. But neither comes close to Colin Powell, whose ratings ranged from 83 percent to 88 percent. Our ruling Clinton said, "When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating." Polling numbers show that it was, in terms of public opinion, the best period of her political career. She's not even close to those favorability numbers now that she's in a tough presidential contest, but we rate her statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ebb5ba66-fd0e-497e-9318-fc451f807af5	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-22T16:04:04	2016-05-22	['None']

pomt-01019	"Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-top-1-percent-earn-more-national-inc/	Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, lately have aired similar concerns about the future of working-class Americans, though they differ over what to do. In his January 2015 State of the Union address, the Democratic president said he wants to work with Congress to offer free community college to students while creating other education, child care and retirement savings programs to help the middle class. Funding, he’s proposed, would come from a $320 billion tax increase on the nation’s highest earners and financial institutions including investment banks. After Obama’s speech, Cruz told Fox News he was disappointed with Obama’s goals to increase government spending and taxes, which he described as hurting hardworking Americans. Then Cruz said the country’s rich and powerful "have gotten fat and happy" on Obama’s watch. "Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928," Cruz said. Take that, Mister President! And was Cruz right? Cruz cites West Coast economist By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack indicated Cruz does not agree with Obama, who said in his speech he wants to reduce the top 1 percent’s after-tax income. Novack said Cruz, rather than increase taxes on the wealthy, believes the only way to "jumpstart the economy is by championing pro-growth policies like energy development and a flatter, simpler tax structure." And, Novack said, Cruz drew his comparison to 1928 from a report by the Pew Research Center citing research by Emmanuel Saez, a University of California, Berkeley economics professor who studies wealth and income inequality. Saez helps steer the World Top Incomes Database, sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, a research center and conglomerate of French universities offering graduate degrees and post-graduate fellowships in economics. The database, in place since 2011, shows the distribution of top incomes for more than 20 countries using data from millions of tax returns collected over about 100 years. By email, Saez said he and economists including Thomas Piketty built the database from sources including public-use files of individual tax returns. The public-use micro-files are blurred to preserve each payer’s confidentiality, Saez said. A closer look To check on changes over time for ourselves, we built a chart from the database. The resulting data, covering 1913, the earliest checkable year, to 2012, shows 1928 and 2012 to be the top two years where the top 1 percent of the richest Americans (the richest of the rich) earned the greatest share of the nation’s income, which the government breaks down into 15 categories including wages, salaries and self-employment income plus income from dividends and interest. In 1928, the top 1 percent of earners, then comprised of about 1.2 million residents, together held 19.6 percent of the nation’s income. In 2008, the year Obama was elected president, the top 1 percent possessed nearly 18 percent. The 1 percent collectively saw its share of the nation’s income escalate nearly 5 percent through the first three years of Obama’s presidency. And in his fourth year, 2012, the 1 percent (nearly 314 million residents) controlled 19.34 percent. According to the database, that was the greatest share these wealthiest Americans had held since 1928, as Cruz said. (No. 3 goes to 1927, when the top 1 percent had 18.7 percent of U.S. income.) Top 15 years the richest American taxpayers had the greatest share of U.S. income 1913 through 2012 Year Top 1% income share 1928 19.6 2012 19.34 1927 18.68 1916 18.57 1929 18.42 2007 18.33 1914 18.16 2006 18.06 1926 18.01 1913 17.96 2008 17.89 2005 17.68 1936 17.64 1917 17.6 1925 17.6 Source: "The World Top Incomes Database," 2011 (accessed Jan. 30, 2015) By email, Saez told us Obama and Congress (which shifted to Republican control in his tenure) did little to address wealth inequality up until 2012 as the country recovered from the Great Recession -- which officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. In a Sept. 3, 2013, report, Saez wrote that in 2012, average real incomes per family in the top 1 percent of earners nationally increased by 19.6 percent, while average incomes among the rest of us grew 1 percent. The report said the entire surge in top 1 percent incomes in 2012 could be a result of income re-timing -- when people hold off on making payments so they can report a higher income to take advantage of lower tax rates. By email, Saez said he expects the top 1 percent’s income share for 2014 to prove slightly lower than in 2012 as a result of tax increases approved by Congress and Obama in 2013 raising the nation’s marginal income-tax rate from 35 to 39.6 percent for married couples earning more than $450,000 annually, starting in 2013. That deal, which also whittled tax deductions for high-earning businesses and individuals, helped the government avoid the "fiscal cliff, a term describing the looming impact of tax cuts initiated by President George W. Bush expiring at the end of 2012 at the same time congressionally mandated spending reductions were due to kick in. Questions about income-inequality research The World Top Incomes Database and Saez’s work have become popular sources for politicians to cite when discussing income and wealth inequality. Still, some experts have raised doubts about what goes into the Piketty-Saez inequality measurements. By email, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said the Saez-Piketty data understate income growth by the bottom 99 percent. That is, he noted, Piketty and Saez limit their focus to pre-tax private income including wages, self-employment earnings, dividends, interest, rental payments and, in some cases, capital gains. The result, Burtless said, is the database doesn’t consider other sources of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans. "If we include these income items, the bottom 99 percent of income recipients has enjoyed much faster increases in income" than what’s "shown by Piketty and Saez," Burtless wrote. Burtless suggested the best statistics on U.S. income inequality come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. "That's because CBO constructs 3 measures of income -- ‘gross market income,’ ‘pretax income’ (gross market income plus cash and no cash government transfers), and ‘after-tax income’ (pre-tax income minus federal income, payroll, and excise taxes)," Burtless said in his email." CBO data indicates that from 2009 to 2010, the top 1 percent’s share of income increased from 13.3 percent to 14.9 percent. (To refresh, Piketty and Saez say their research shows the top 1 percent’s share of income escalating from 16.68 percent to 17.45 percent.) Next, we talked to Robert Litan, another economist with the Brookings Institution, about why income inequality escalated so quickly in Obama’s first term. By email, Litan said reasons for the rising share of the top 1 percent’s income include "rising CEO pay relative to workers, extraordinary success of tech entrepreneurs in particular, made possible by Internet + globalization, and successful financiers, especially hedge fund managers." A June 12, 2014 article by the liberal Economic Policy Institute also highlights inequality in earnings and compensation between CEOs and typical workers. Burtless and Litan also told us by email Congress and Obama could not have done much to affect the percentage increase of the top 1 percent’s income based on Piketty-Saez measurements. "The Congress and president have a bigger direct impact on after-tax income than on pre-tax income because their decisions directly affect the tax burdens and government transfer payments of families in different positions in the income distribution," Burtless said. Our ruling Cruz said: "Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928." Cruz accurately recapped calculations of income by respected researchers though this statement fails to note there are some income streams not part of the cited calculations that would tend to help those of us in the bottom 99 percent, relatively speaking. Also, tax changes that took effect in 2013 may slightly be reducing how much of the nation’s income is held by the top 1 percent. Mark this statement Mostly True.

pomt-07747	The law has not established whether Rhode Island public employees have property rights to their pensions.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/27/gina-raimondo/raimondo-says-law-has-not-established-whether-rhod/	As states and municipalities across the country struggle with huge budget deficits, many have taken aim at public employee pay and benefits -- especially pension benefits. Lawmakers in 18 states made changes in public employee pension plans last year, according to a report by the Pew Center on the States. More states, including Rhode Island, are weighing changes this year, provoking protests and legal challenges from public employee unions. State General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, who has been sounding the alarm about Rhode Island’s $5 billion unfunded pension liability, was questioned about the issue Feb. 18 on WRNI’s "Political Roundtable" show. One exchange caught our attention: Do state employees have a "property right" to their pensions? she was asked. "I don’t believe so," Raimondo said. "That hasn’t been established in law and I don’t believe they do." Raimondo reiterated her position Feb. 25 on Channel 12 "Newsmakers." Asked about property rights for state pensions, she said, "this is an unsettled area of law. So in Rhode Island, our pension benefits are put out in statute, they’re not put out in a contract, as they are in some states. They’re not put out in the Constitution. It’s put out in statute. So it’s still an unsettled area of law." The point Raimondo was making is critical. In the radio interview she said that in 10 years Rhode Island will need $1 billion to cover its pension obligations and the state won’t be able to afford that. The entire pension system has to change, she said. Any ruling that public employees have property rights to their pensions could make it much more difficult to change the system, because both the federal and state Constitutions prohibit the taking of private property for public uses without compensation. So was Raimondo right when she said that workers’ "property rights" to their pensions hadn’t been established in law? We decided to check. There is a lawsuit pending against the state, filed by state employee unions to reverse cutbacks in their pensions that were made in 2009 and 2010 by the General Assembly. That lawsuit contends that the pension changes violated their contracts and also constituted a "takings" of the employees’ property without "just compensation." The 2009 and 2010 pension cutbacks included increasing the minimum retirement age, reducing the percentage of pay on which pensions are based, and limits on cost of living increases. They are expected to save taxpayers $59.4 million in the current fiscal year. Key people on both sides of the lawsuit were reluctant to discuss the property-rights issue last week. Ken DeLorenzo, executive director of the union, would say only: "We believe the government can’t take away your life or your property." Attorney Lynette Labinger, the unions’ lead lawyer, said that the case is still in its early stages and a long way from settled. Attorney John Tarantino, who is representing the state in the case, also declined to say much about the litigation, but added, "I can say this, we intend to dispute the union’s allegations" concerning property rights over worker pensions. We asked Raimondo’s spokeswoman, Joy Fox, what Raimondo based her statement on. She said that Raimondo, a lawyer, was referring to "case law," specifically an April 13, 2010, decision by U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith. Smith’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed in Providence by Council 94, the state’s largest public employee union, to block changes the legislature made to health benefits for some of its members. Smith rejected all of the union arguments, including one that the reduction in health benefits violated state and federal "takings clauses’’ that forbid the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. While he cited other cases involving pension benefits, Smith’s ruling was specifically about health-care benefits. So we sought other guidance. We contacted attorney Daniel K. Kinder, a labor lawyer with 30 years of experience, mostly representing management. Kinder was one of two lawyers who testified in 2008 before a special Rhode Island House commission studying the state’s pension system. He said he’s certain that Raimondo’s statement is correct. No court, he said, has established property rights to Rhode Island state employee pensions. (The other lawyer who testified, Gerard Cobleigh, who often represents the state employee unions, couldn’t be reached.) In their 2008 testimony, Kinder and Cobleigh said state employees pensions are protected by contracts and by statutes. They described a sliding scale of legal risk to the state if it makes changes to the pension benefits, with the least risk for new employees to the most risk for those retired. Finally, we reached out to Roger Williams University School of Law, where we talked to Professor Bruce Kogan. He said property rights to public-sector pensions could be determined by statute or judicial decision, but he was unaware of either happening in Rhode Island. That opinion was seconded by Michael Yelnosky, a professor of labor and employment law at Roger Williams. He said he has not seen any case in state or local federal courts that establishes property rights for pensions. So where are we? * Raimondo’s spokeswoman cited a federal court ruling to back up her claim that public workers don’t have an established property right to their pensions. That ruling provides some support to her statement; a separate state case that raises the issue is unresolved. * A prominent labor lawyer and two law professors agree that, as Raimondo suggests, the issue has yet to be resolved in Rhode Island. So until a court rules otherwise, Raimondo’s statement is True.	None	Gina Raimondo	None	None	None	2011-02-27T00:00:01	2011-02-18	['Rhode_Island']

pomt-11831	Says the New York bike path assault "was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/nov/10/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-makes-half-true-claim-new-york-atta/	U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul said that when a man drove a truck into pedestrians and bicyclists in New York, killing eight, the attack fit a perilous international pattern. The Austin Republican, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, made his claim after being asked by Bret Baier of Fox News to share what he knew. McCaul replied: "This was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS. Remember Nice (France)--we saw this happen previously." Baier: "So you think this is ISIS," the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. McCaul: "I believe when an individual yells out, ‘Allahu akbar,’ all the indicators and hallmarks of an act of terror and, I think, yeah, that’s true in this case." Baier asked about the difference between individuals self-radicalized or inspired by ISIS as opposed to being directed by ISIS. McCaul replied: "You know, I think those lines are blurred now" because of the ability of ISIS to radicalize people using online posts. We asked McCaul how he reached his conclusion that the New York attack was the ninth vehicle assault by ISIS. By email, Margaret Anne Moore, staff spokeswoman for the homeland security committee, sent a list she described as specifying eight previous "vehicular attacks to the West by ISIS" from March through September 2017. Asked how McCaul determined each attack was "by ISIS," Moore said that in each instance, "either ISIS claimed responsibility or the perpetrator claimed to be doing it in the name of ISIS, as reported by the press and/or local law enforcement." The staff-provided list: 3/22/2017 – London, United Kingdom – Westminster Bridge attack 4/7/2017 – Stockholm, Sweden – Hijacked truck attack on central street in Stockholm 6/3/2017 – London, United Kingdom – London Bridge and Borough Market attack 6/19/2017 – Paris, France – Champs-Elysee car ramming attack 8/9/2017 – Paris, France – Soldier barracks attack 8/17/2017 – Barcelona, Spain – Las Ramblas attack 8/18/2017 – Cambrils, Spain – Vehicle ramming 9/30/2017 – Edmonton, Canada – Police ramming and stabbing 10/31/2017 – New York – Lower Manhattan bike path attack McCaul’s list, limited to attacks in 2017, didn’t include the attack in Nice he mentioned on Fox News. Earlier, an April 2017 Newsweek story counted that attack among several ISIS-linked vehicle attacks; the story said that Tunisian Mohamed Bouhlel in July 2016 drove a truck into revellers in Nice celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people. Newsweek’s story also singled out Tunisian Anis Amri driving a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016, killing 12 people. ISIS conducted? For our part, we reviewed news stories listed in connection with the attacks on the staff-provided list supplemented by our own finds and additional stories flagged by Moore. In most instances, we found, the stories suggest an ISIS claim to responsibility or inspiration by ISIS. A U.S. expert on terrorist attacks separately told us she saw no corroboration of ISIS being directly involved in any of the attacks tallied by McCaul’s aide. Our breakdown: In March 2017, six people died after Khalid Masood drove a car into pedestrians on a sidewalk near London’s Westminster Bridge. A BBC news story said the so-called Islamic State said it was behind the attack. According to an Oct. 31, 2017, ABC News story, ISIS called Masood, who was shot dead by police, "a soldier of the Islamic State." The next month, Rakhmat Akilov, an Uzbek man, drove a stolen truck into a Stockholm department store, killing four people. A BBC news account quoted Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, calling the incident a terror attack. A subsequent New York Times news story said the Islamic State had not claimed credit though it quoted Uzbekistan’s foreign minister, Abdulaziz Kamilov, saying Akilov had been recruited by the Islamic State. At a press conference, according to Reuters, Jonas Hysing, chief of national police operations, said: "The suspect had expressed sympathy for extremist organizations, among them IS," described as an acronym for the ultra-hardline militant group. A subsequent news story in the Independent, a British online news service, said Akilov told authorities ​he got his "order" for the attack directly from Isis in Syria. In June 2017, Khuram Butt, a British national, was believed to have led a trio of terrorists who used a van to plow into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing customers in pubs and bars, killing seven people. In 2016, the Telegraph newspaper reported, Butt appeared in a documentary entitled "The Jihadis Next Door." ISIS claimed responsibility, ABC News reported. The same month, Karim Cheurfi drove a car into a police van on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. CNN reported that according to its affiliate, BFMTV, that the driver, shot dead by police, "was under what is known as a ‘Fiche S’ file, a French terror/radicalization watch list composed of thousands of names, of which some are under active surveillance. Active surveillance means that they are on law enforcement's radar, not necessarily under rigorous surveillance," CNN said. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a message posted on a jihadi channel, the New York Times reported. Also, according to a June 2017 news story posted by The Daily Beast, the driver had mailed letters on the day of his death pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In France in August 2017, a man identified by authorities as Hamou Benlatreche allegedly injured six soldiers by driving into them at Place de Verdun, not far from the town hall in Levallois-Perret, which is home to France’s main intelligence agency. The Guardian newspaper reported that French authorities remained cautious per the driver’s motives. An August 2017 Associated Press news story quoted prosecutor Francois Molins saying Benlatreche was a member of a fundamentalist Islamic movement, Tablighi Jamaat, but there was no evidence that he had connections with ISIS members. Less than two weeks later, a driver plowed a van through crowds on Las Ramblas, Barcelona’s main pedestrian boulevard, leaving 13 people dead, CNN reported, with Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, calling it an act of "jihadi terrorism." CNN said ISIS' media wing, Amaq, had said the perpetrators were "soldiers of the Islamic State" yet ISIS hadn’t "explicitly claimed responsibility." The next day, police in the Spanish resort town of Cambrils, south of Barcelona, shot five people after they drove their car at pedestrians and police officers, Reuters reported. ISIS claimed responsibility in a communique, the Independent reported. In Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, was accused of running down a police officer with his car and then stabbing him repeatedly on the last Saturday of September 2017. CBC News quoted Edmonton’s police chief, Rod Knecht, confirming that a black ISIS flag was seized from a car where the officer was attacked. Police said the driver fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians during an unsuccessful attempt to evade capture. Vehicular attacks not uncommon In December 2016, Aki Peritz, a former CIA analyst, said in a post on NPR’s website that driving a car into people in a terror attack wasn’t a new tactic nor one uniquely employed by Islamic State believers. For example, in mid-2008, at least three separate Palestinian attackers used cars and bulldozers to kill and injure multiple people in and around Jerusalem, Peritz wrote, and a Uighur militant group rammed a dump truck into a group of 70 Chinese police officers and then attacked them with machetes, killing 16. By email to our inquiry, Peritz suggested the accuracy of McCaul’s claim might turn on how you categorize attacks linked to, or inspired by, ISIS. It’s also unwise, on the other hand, to limit counts to attacks in the West, Peritz suggested. "Do Iraqi civilians and soldiers count in this metric? ISIS has been using suicide car bombs for a long time, against military and civilian targets. Let us not be so ethnocentric as to forget those individuals as well," Peritz wrote. At Peritz’s suggestion, we checked on whether the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, based at the University of Maryland, tracks vehicular attacks by ISIS. A consortium spokeswoman, Jessica Stark Rivinius, replied by email that the consortium drew on news reports to identify 20 such attacks globally over the years involving vehicles employed as contact weapons--including nine attacks attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or its predecessor; four attributed to affiliated groups; and seven attributed to ISIL-inspired individuals lacking a direct link to the organization. The consortium’s list of the 20 incidents, dating from June 2007 into June 2017, shows that half a dozen occurred in Iraq with others taking place in Israel, Indonesia, Sweden, France, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada, Indonesia, Glasgow in Scotland, London, Berlin--and Columbus, Ohio, where the consortium says ISIL claimed responsibility for an assailant in 2016 ramming his vehicle into students and bystanders, though the driver’s ISIL connection couldn’t be confirmed. A 2016 background paper spells out five ways the consortium classifies attacks possibly related to ISIL; the paper further lists 30 groups as ISIS affiliates. "In order to classify an attack as ISIL-inspired," the consortium says, "we relied on statements made by the perpetrator(s) or other direct evidence (e.g., journals, social media messaging)." An August 2017 update states: "Several terrorist attacks in Western Europe in 2016, including two of the mass-casualty ISIL-related attacks in France and Germany, involved vehicles used as contact weapons (rather than as vehicle-borne IEDs). Although this tactic is not unprecedented, there has been a marked increase in the frequency and lethality of these attacks." An accompanying chart depicts ups and downs in vehicular attacks since 2002, indicating spikes in deaths of late: SOURCE: Report, "Overview: Terrorism in 2016," National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, August 2017 (accessed Nov. 8, 2017) A consortium specialist, Erin Miller, told us the organization considers an attack outside of Iraq or Syria, where ISIS is known to be based, to be connected to the group only if perpetrators show, or proclaim, inspiration by the group. Miller said that it’s not enough solely for the group to claim responsibility as it did after the Westminster Bridge attack. Miller elaborated in an email: "Likewise, in order to classify an attack outside Iraq/Syria as perpetrated by ISIL (not just ISIL-inspired individuals) we need some evidence that ISIL members they were tactically/operationally responsible. The 2015 Paris attacks are a good example of this. The actual perpetrators who orchestrated and carried out the attack were ID'd by authorities as members of ISIL." Oft-reported claims about ISIS’s responsibility, Miller said, are typically brief and vague, for instance describing attackers as "soldiers of the Caliphate." She allowed, though, that this distinction splits hairs "between the concept of responsibility in a tactical/operational sense and responsibility in an abstract philosophical sense." At our request, Miller reviewed the list of vehicular attacks provided by McCaul’s aide. Her conclusion: The consortium wouldn’t attribute any of the nine attacks to the Islamic State itself yet up to five of the attacks may have been ISIS-inspired--those in New York, on the Champs-Elysee and London Bridge, Edmonton and maybe Stockholm. Miller suggested no corroborated ISIS connections to the attacks in Spain or those on Westminster Bridge and on soldiers in Paris. Miller cautioned too that consortium determinations for attacks after June 2017 remain preliminary "as we haven't done the data collection for these attacks yet." We shared Miller’s assessment with Moore, McCaul’s aide, who reaffirmed her previous broader claim than what McCaul said to Fox News: "Based on the open-source information we provided, the Committee believes the 9 vehicular attacks the chairman cited were either claimed by ISIS or the perpetrator was inspired by ISIS." Our ruling McCaul said the New York bike path assault "was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS." McCaul based his claim on nine 2017 attacks--none of them confirmed to have been conducted by ISIS. Regardless, it looks like more than half may have been ISIS-inspired and if you consider actions globally over time, ISIS merits blame for at least nine vehicular assaults.

"NBC just fired Megyn Kelly before her new show begins," reads the headline on a March 8, 2017, article on USPostman.com. The story says that while Kelly left Fox News to be "a white version of Oprah Winfrey on NBC," she has terminated her contract because she didn’t want to do puff pieces and celebrity interviews. We attempted to contact USPostman.com through their Facebook page (the website has no contact information) but did not receive a response. USPostman.com is registered to an address in Macedonia, a known hotbed of fake news websites. PunditFact examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life." It was flagged by Facebook users as being fake. Kelly announced in January 2017 she was leaving Fox News six months before her contract was up. She is moving to NBC, where she reportedly will be hosting a morning show starting in May as well as a Sunday night news magazine. She reportedly gave up an offer of $20 million per year to stay at Fox, where she had accused former CEO Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. A closer reading of the USPostman.com post raises suspicions. It quotes both her supposed new NBC producer Hugh McGovern and NBC Universal CEO Maxwell Seawald as saying unflattering things about her desire and ability to be a journalist. It doesn’t appear these are real people; NBC Universal’s CEO is actually Steven Burke. USPostman.com cites SGSNews.com as the source of its story, but the true source is TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which published its article on March 8. It’s common for fake news websites to appropriate content from other websites. But TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked, admits it makes up its stories. While there isn’t an indication on the post itself, TheLastLineOfDefense.org says on its About Us link that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." There’s no such admission on USPostman.com, but the story is still made up. Kelly has not been fired from NBC.

pomt-09099	Jeff Greene "is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/22/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-jeff-greene-credit-default-swap/	Jeff Greene's personal fortune may be financing his campaign for the U.S. Senate, but it's also become the chief line of attack for his Democratic primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek. Greene -- who has three (yes, 3) personal jets and a 145-foot yacht -- manages a real estate portfolio that he says once totaled $1 billion. That's not the issue, however. What is, Meek says, is Greene's decision to hedge those real estate investments in 2006 and 2007 by investing in a complicated financial instrument called Credit Default Swaps. The investment essentially paid out when other people's mortgages went bust, or their properties fell into foreclosure. Sensing the housing collapse, Greene admits he made hundreds of millions of dollars betting that property owners wouldn't be able to make payments on bad or risky mortgages. The investments, while perhaps unseemly, are legal. But that hasn't stopped Meek from making an issue of them in a suddenly competitive primary. In their first debate in West Palm Beach on June 22, 2010, Meek accused Greene of hoping Floridians would lose their homes. He then charged those investments helped sink the U.S. economy. "He is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now," Meek said. That's a heavy charge -- that Greene pioneered the investment strategy that wrecked the U.S. economy. Is it right? First we need to explain just what a Credit Default Swap is. Then Greene's role. Then the role of the Credit Default Swap in ruining the economy. And we're going to try to do all of it without giving you a headache. Credit Default Swaps Maybe we're kind of dumbing this down too much, but Credit Default Swaps have a lot in common with a Las Vegas casino game. Investors are essentially betting on mortgages and specifically that property owners won't pay. The bettors, or investors, put up a fraction of the money they could possibly win should they be right. In theory, the house -- or the bank -- should win a lot more than it loses because the bets are cheaper when compared to the possible payouts. And in a normal market, banks likely would have won more than they lost. But the housing collapse changed the dynamics of the bet. Greene talks about it another way, describing it as a type of insurance. And that's not an altogether bad description in his case. In 2006, Greene's massive real estate portfolio stood to plummet in value if the housing market reversed. Credit Default Swaps, he said, were a way to hedge against those potential losses. If the value of his real estate portfolio declined, his swaps likely would pay off. And if the housing market continued to climb, he'd lose his bets but recoup that money in real estate gains. Of course, he couldn't get anyone to take bets on his own properties, because he could manipulate whether or not they defaulted. So, instead, he found other properties and mortgages that he thought would be at high risk for default. "I was buying insurance," Greene told the Palm Beach Post editorial board. "I was at risk for hundreds of millions of dollars. I ended up making hundreds of milions of dollars." He bet on between 18 and 20 mortgage pools (accounts we've seen vary). A mortgage pool is exactly what it sounds like -- a grouping of individual mortgages. Greene's role Gregory Zuckerman, a Wall Street Journal writer, detailed Greene's gamble in the book "The Greatest Trade Ever." Zuckerman interviewed Greene and about a dozen of his friends and colleagues for the book, which also features other investors' attempts to profit off Credit Default Swaps. Thanks to the housing collapse, Zuckerman said Greene netted about $500 million on his bets. The book is a fascinating look at an often poorly described and little understood part of Wall Street. It also does an excellent job of documenting Greene's mindset about the trades he was making. Zuckerman agreed to speak with PolitiFact Florida about his work. Specifically, we wanted to know if Greene's description -- that he invested in Credit Default Swaps as protection against his real estate investments -- was accurate. "It started out as a way to protect himself, but it evolved into the greatest trade he ever found," Zuckerman said. Greene was making millions of dollars a day on his trades, Zuckerman said, and he didn't want to give it up. Not that he had any real reason to. Greene understood that his success meant problems for a mortgage holder somewhere else -- often in California, Nevada or Florida where the housing collapse was especially accute -- and he had sympathy for the property owners, Zuckerman said. But he believed it was the banks who were the true culprits, since they were the institutions that convinced people they could afford homes they had no business purchasing. Greene's thinking is captured during an exchange with Boston real estate developer Jeffrey Libert that is retold in Zuckerman's book. "Libert, why are you being so uptight about it?" Greene asked. "It just gives me the heebie-jeebies." "You didn't cause it!" "Yeah, I know. But we're cheering for it." Later, talking to the author, Greene explained his thinking. "I didn't even think about (the moral aspects of Credit Default Swaps). If more people had been (invested in Credit Default Swaps) early on, then the pricing of debt would have been higher and things wouldn't have become so crazy. The world would have been a better place had more people been shorting. We had nothing to do with what happened to homeowners." Greene was not the first person to pursue Credit Default Swaps. In fact, he stole the idea from John Paulson, a New York hedge fund operator. And other hedge funds pursued Credit Default Swaps before Paulson. But Greene was among the first and most successful private investors to make the gamble. "He convinced people like Merrill Lynch to do the trade when they wouldn't do it for other individuals," Zuckerman said. "Greene potentially is one of the only individuals in the country to have pulled this trade off." Credit Default Swaps and the economic collapse To continue the casino analogy, the housing market collapse allowed Greene and others to pick the spin of the roulette wheel time after time after time. Zuckerman says some Credit Default Swaps paid off 40 to 1. That means, on one hand, banks were having to cut big checks to investors. It also meant money wasn't coming in from the mortgage holders. Banks, in turn, produced huge losses. The financial industry collapsed. Between 2000 and 2008, the market for swaps ballooned from $900 billion to more than $30 trillion, the New York Times reported. AIG, for instance, traded Credit Default Swaps -- though not necessarily to Greene. The federal government had to offer $182.3 billion to rescue AIG at the height of the financial crisis. But it wasn't the only problem. Critics have argued that banks were too easily making loans, and that the government lacked proper regulation. And when it comes to Credit Default Swaps, the real problem was that banks made the investments so cheap and the reward so great that it wasn't the idea of Credit Default Swaps that was the problem, but the terms of specific deals, Zuckerman said. "Credit Default Swaps are like fertilizer," Zuckerman said. "They can be used for good or bad." We liked another description, this one coming from a report from NPR: "If bad mortgages got the financial system sick," they wrote, "Credit Default Swaps helped spread the illness worldwide." And then, to round out our casino analogy, here's what Fortune said: "There is at least one key difference between casino gambling and Credit Default Swap trading: Gambling has strict government regulation." Our Ruling This is a tricky one, in part because we know Credit Default Swaps are going to be talked about a lot more as this Senate primary plays out. In this case, we want to be clear that we're sticking specifically to fact checking the statement Meek made, that Greene is the "king" of the Credit Default Swap that "brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now." Greene wasn't king of the practice of Credit Default Swaps, but we think it's fair to say he was in the royal court. He actually stole the idea from a New York hedge fund manager, who himself wasn't the first to bet on mortgages going bad. Greene was, however, one of the more successful cases stories and made about $500 million. And saying Credit Default Swaps brought about the destruction of the U.S. economy glosses over the subprime mortgage crisis and concerns over lax regulation, for starters. Banks helped people get into homes they simply couldn't afford, and wrote risky mortgages that resulted in delinquent payments, defaults and eventually foreclosures. In our mind, Meek's statement is an attempt to boil a very complex issue into a made-for-TV sound byte. The statement may be sexy, but it's more hyperbole than anything. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03979	Military spending cuts, known as the sequester, were President Barack Obama’s idea.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-sequester-was-obamas-idea/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio delivered the Republicans’ response to the State of the Union address, criticizing President Barack Obama on policy but also style. "Any time anyone opposes the president’s agenda, he and his allies usually respond by falsely attacking their motives," Rubio said. He named several examples, including the sweeping cuts to military and other spending set to take effect unless Congress and the president agree on deficit-reduction package. "Tonight, he even criticized us for refusing to raise taxes to delay military cuts – cuts that were his idea in the first place," Rubio said. For the record, Obama didn’t make that specific criticism in his speech, but here we’re focusing on the second half of Rubio’s statement about where the idea of the cuts originated. We have examined claims similar to this before, when Mitt Romney made the charge during the presidential campaign, and when Obama turned the tables and blamed the sequester on Congress. Let’s review. In search of a budget deal In 2011, the federal government was nearing its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing. Raising the debt limit (also called the debt ceiling) was in some ways symbolic: Congress has the power of the purse, and the decisions to spend the money had already been made. But that didn’t stop a showdown in the summer of 2011. House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the White House, and at first the sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, dubbed the "grand bargain." The closed-door negotiations fell apart, though, and a flurry of finger pointing ensued. Some observers blamed Boehner for being unable to deliver his own Republicans on a deal, thanks to tea party opposition to any new taxes. Others blamed Obama for his inexperience, for not cultivating relationships with Republicans and for tactical mistakes at negotiating. Some blamed both. At any rate, Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious agreement to raise the debt limit through the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law found approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. This 12-member committee became known as "the super-committee." The super-committee was supposed to meet and agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 23, 2011. Their proposal -- which could include tax increases, spending reductions or both -- would then get a filibuster-proof, up-or-down vote in Congress. As an incentive to action, the law included an unusual kind of budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are referred to as "sequestration." Lo and behold, the super-committee didn’t agree on a deficit reduction package, so Congress never voted on it. More deadlines have come and gone, and smaller budget patches have been passed. But the sequester is looming again, with big cuts set to hit March 1. Whose idea? Some of the most detailed reporting on sequestration is from Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his book The Price of Politics. Woodward’s reporting shows clearly that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House. The intention, however, was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect. Woodward summarizes the thoughts of the Obama team: "There would be no chance the Republicans would want to pull the trigger and allow the sequester to force massive cuts to Defense." Democrats, meanwhile, didn’t want to see their favorite domestic programs cut. As the negotiations proceeded, Republicans seemed to think the same thing. "Boehner told the House Republican leadership and other key members not to worry about the sequester … ‘Guys, this would be devastating to Defense,’ he said. ‘This would be devastating, from their perspective, on their domestic priorities. This is never going to happen.’" Yet even as the deadline nears (again), it’s clear neither side wants federal spending to plummet. In August 2012, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a report detailing how sequestration will affect different departments. In its introduction, the OMB repeats the Obama administration’s opposition to the process. "The specter of harmful across-the-board cuts to defense and nondefense programs was intended to drive both sides to compromise. Congress can and should take action to avoid it by passing a comprehensive and balanced deficit reduction package. "As the administration has made clear, no amount of planning can mitigate the effect of these cuts. Sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument. It is not the responsible way for our nation to achieve deficit reduction." Still, some people we say that the Obama White House proposed sequestration, so that means Obama owns it. Here's what experts told us last fall. "While both parties are culpable for sequestration because the Budget Control Act passed Congress, the president proposed it originally and ultimately owns its outcome," said Mackenzie Eaglen, an expert on defense with the conservative American Enterprise Institute who advised the Romney campaign. "That is because he alone can lead by calling the party leaders together for a resolution today if he wanted as president." Other see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration, especially since Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26) "The logic that lays the blame for sequestration at Obama's feet, because he negotiated the BCA with GOP leaders in Congress, could just as easily apply to those other negotiators, or, indeed, any member of Congress who voted for the BCA in August 2011," said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Preble favors reductions to the defense budget. Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense also noted that sequestration results from a law passed in the usual manner. "I think the fact that Congress passed it means it is not a presidential mandate. It was a law that originated in Congress and was sent to the president’s desk," she said. Our ruling Rubio said the defense cuts known that are part of sequestration were Obama’s "idea in the first place." That doesn’t tell the whole story -- particularly the fact that Obama does not favor these cuts. The White House proposed them as a means of driving the two sides to a compromise over the deficit, not as a real-world spending plan. Still, the idea did originate with Obama’s team.

pomt-11830	"The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/10/ted-cruz/could-ted-cruz-have-prevented-texas-church-shootin/	Reacting to the church shootings in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz said there could have been laws on the books to prevent what happened, had his opponents in Congress not defeated his proposal a few years ago. "The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church," Cruz said on Fox News on Nov. 6. Cruz, a Republican, is talking about a failed amendment he co-sponsored to curtail an expansion of background checks and increase prosecution of people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. He has a point that the Democrats didn’t back it, but he fails to mention that every amendment on the 2013 gun control bill faced the same hurdle, and a Democratic one also fell short. While Democrats defeated his proposal, experts said it would not have made the crucial difference in this massacre for a couple of reasons. Guidelines were already in the works The Texas church shooter was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct after he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson's skull. Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction, but he got past the background check system because the Air Force failed to enter the shooter’s felony into the background check database. So when he purchased two guns at the San Antonio gun shop Academy Sports + Outdoors, both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When we asked Cruz’s office for details, they softened what Cruz originally said, saying his legislation would have "increased the chances of preventing the Air Force error that led to the failure to submit the relevant information to NICS." The amendment pushed for clearer guidance on submissions of federal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (mandated by NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) and required that federal agencies submit plans for making the information available. "The only possible contribution may have been that the reporting requirement to the AG might have led the Defense Department and the Air Force to realize that the procedures they had in place needed enhancement," said Geoffrey Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But the language was a near replica of President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16, 2013 memorandum to the Justice Department, which officials were already trying to implement. Molly Moran, who served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General from 2014 to 2016, said she and her colleagues at the Justice Department worked from 2013 until the end of Obama’s second term in implementing the memo. It made no difference in the Texas church shooting. The Air Force needed to submit the shooter’s 2012 court-martial, and it failed to do so. Scaling back penalties for failure to share Cruz said on Fox that a lack of reporting of federal and state records to the background check system was a problem. But his legislation did not seem to make this easier. The amendment eliminated sanctions for states that failed to submit records and lowered the cap on grant money to help states submit them from $100 million to $20 million. The original bill from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., would have expanded background checks on purchases from only federally licensed gun dealers to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. But the Grassley-Cruz amendment chucked the expansion of background checks and even allowed for the interstate sale and transportation of firearms. "If anything, the only way this would have affected the Texas shooting would be to make it easier for the shooter to attack a church in a neighboring state instead," said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Prosecution of lying on background checks Cruz also summoned a familiar talking point against gun regulation that few background check lies (where felons say they are not felons) are prosecuted. His amendment created a task force to increase these prosecutions, but it did not mandate that the Justice Department prosecute all of them. Enhanced prosecution efforts still would not have put the shooter behind bars. Without the court-martial in the database, the shooter would still have passed the background check after marking that he was not a felon. "He could have been prosecuted had his lie been known by prosecutors, but they had no reason to investigate this until after the shooting," said Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. The filibuster aspect Reid set a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 to prevent a situation in which the amendment passed by a bare majority and then was filibustered — by the Republican minority. Cruz’s amendment failed 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). So did the bipartisan Toomey-Manchin background check amendment favored by Democrats, which got 54 votes. Experts said it was fair to call this a filibuster, though Reid attained the Senate's unanimous consent for the 60-vote threshold. "The notion that the Democrats are responsible for the failure of this proposal ignores the fact that the GOP was filibustering the underlying bill, which had all the same provisions except the state-to-state expansion of gun rights and a requirement to expand background checks," Koger said. Our ruling Cruz said, "The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison." The amendment Cruz cosponsored, which was defeated largely by Democrats after failing to reach a 60-vote threshold, strengthened efforts to prosecute people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. But the shooter in this case wouldn’t have showed up as having lied because of the Air Force’s failure to report his felony. The Cruz proposal also aimed to facilitate reporting to the instant background check system with guidelines and deadlines for federal agencies, including the armed services. While similar action by the Obama Justice Department around the same time didn’t help, Cruz’s clarifications becoming law may have. But it’s impossible to say with any certainty.

pomt-10737	"Our children's safety is potentially at risk because nearly half of the apple juice consumed by our children comes from apples grown in China."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/09/john-edwards/some-bad-apples-/	In an Oct. 29, 2007, speech at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., John Edwards said the government and business worlds are gripped by corruption and a lack of leadership. He focused in part on trade deals that he said help corporations at the expense of American workers and consumers. He said: "We have even gotten to the point where our children's safety is potentially at risk because nearly half of the apple juice consumed by our children comes from apples grown in China." To put the number at "nearly half" is a stretch. Actually, about 38 percent of the apple juice consumed in the United States comes from China, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. When it comes to apple juice, the United States is the world's biggest importer and China is, by far, the biggest producer. On average over the past three years, about 26 percent of the U.S. apple juice supply was produced domestically. The rest comes primarily from China, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Germany, in that order. China's 50 percent share of the U.S. imported supply is up tenfold from 1997. China has dramatically increased its apple production since the mid 1990s and today is the world's biggest exporter of apple juice thanks to low labor costs. Demand for apple juice has hit record levels in recent years -- and not just because it's a popular kid drink. The product also is used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Is Edwards right when he says children are "potentially at risk" from Chinese apple juice? He puts himself on reasonably safe ground, given recent problems with Chinese seafood, toothpaste, pet food and toys -- including the November 2007 revelation that a chemical coating used in the popular Aqua Dots toy turns into a "date rape" drug when ingested. A 20-month-old Arkansas boy who ate Aqua Dots beads vomited and went into a coma. A November 2006 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides even more support. The report states that China's food safety problems stem from the country's cumbersome infrastructure: 200-million farm households, each cultivating one to two acres of often non-contiguous land with no incentive under the Communist system to invest in improvements. Chinese farmers, the report says, are known for using high levels of chemical fertilizers to get the most out of their plots. Many use "highly toxic pesticides, including some that are banned in the United States." As for China's food distribution system, it is "dominated by millions of small traders handling small volumes of product, often operating on a cash basis, with no documentation," the report says. China is starting to overhaul its food safety system, the report says, but has a long way to go. We can't rule this as True because his numbers are off, but his point about lots of our apple juice coming from China is true. It's also true that their safety standards don't meet ours. So, that's how we end up with Mostly True.	None	John Edwards	None	None	None	2007-11-09T00:00:00	2007-10-29	['China']
pomt-12127	"Foxconn tax break could exceed $1 million per job."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/16/jennifer-shilling/wisconsin-paying-foxconn-1-million-job-possible-if/	When one Democratic lawmaker claimed Wisconsin is offering $3 billion to Foxconn for 3,000 jobs, or $1 million per job, the math didn’t work. We rated the statement, by state Rep. Melissa Sargent of Madison, False. The full $3 billion would be paid only if the plant Foxconn plans to put in Wisconsin creates 13,000 jobs. But is it possible that the Foxconn offer could end up costing Wisconsin taxpayers more than $1 million per job? Perhaps. A new $1 million-per-job claim was made by another Democratic lawmaker, state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, on Aug. 14, 2017. The same day, the $3 billion incentive package cleared its first legislative hurdle, winning approval from a Republican-controlled Assembly committee. Shilling made her claim in a news release about the $3 billion that carried this headline: "Foxconn tax break could exceed $1 million per job." Let’s crunch the numbers. The $3 billion Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has pledged to invest up to $10 billion on a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing facility that would employ at least 3,000 people, and up to 13,000. In turn, Wisconsin has offered the company up to $3 billion in incentives. We’ve already reported that based on the best available data, Wisconsin’s offer would be the largest incentive ever provided by a state to a foreign company. It’s helpful to think about the $3 billion in three parts -- a $2.85 billion in essentially cash payments and the rest in a sales tax exemption: Up to $1.35 billion in tax credits paid to Foxconn if the company invests at least $9 billion in the plant Up to $1.5 billion in payments if Foxconn creates 13,000 jobs $150 million in sales tax exemptions So, the more the company spends on capital and payroll, the more cash it gets from Wisconsin taxpayers. Shilling’s claim Shilling bases her claim on Foxconn making the full capital investment -- but employing only 1,000 people. Here is her math: The $9 billion capital investment would bring Foxconn a $1.35 billion payment 1,000 jobs -- with what the company says would be for an average salary of $53,876, and the jobs last for 15 years -- would bring another $137 million That totals $1.49 billion in tax credit payments. Divide that by 1,000 jobs and you get $1.49 million per job. Jon Peacock, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, and Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed to us that Shilling’s math is accurate. And Peacock, who has done an analysis on Wisconsin’s offer to Foxconn, told us that even if 1,500 jobs were created, the cost to taxpayers would still exceed $1 million per job. But Shilling is doing some cherry picking. She is taking Foxconn at its word that it will invest at least $9 billion, but rejecting the company’s pledge that it will create at least 3,000 jobs. And a large investment with relatively few jobs results in a higher per-job cost to taxpayers. Moreover, it’s not clear that Foxconn would invest $9 billion or more in a plant that would employ only 1,000 people. Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, insisted to us that "no company would invest anything close to $10 billion" to create only 1,000 or 1,500 jobs. "It just wouldn’t make economic sense. You wouldn’t be able to produce enough to recoup the investment." Scott Manley, a senior vice president at Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, echoed Still’s analysis. He said that based on Foxconn’s plans to spend $10 billion on a plant that eventually would employ 13,000 people, WMC estimates the company would spend only $769.2 million on the plant if the plant only employed 1,000 people. He said that comes out to $252,000 per job, based on the tax credits the company would collect for its investment and payroll. In short, it simply isn’t known yet how much Foxconn will spend on capital or on payroll -- leaving the amount of incentives to be paid up in the air. How many jobs? In a memorandum of understanding it signed with the state, Foxconn has pledged to invest up to $10 billion in its plant. And it has said it would initially employ 3,000 people, with the potential to employ 13,000. (We rated Half True a claim by Republican Gov. Scott Walker that Foxconn "is bringing" 13,000 jobs.) But the agreement has no minimums on capital investment or hiring. (The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. told us it is negotiating a contract with Foxconn "that will outline annual benchmarks that will need to be met in order for the company to access, and retain, these tax credits.") Finally, it’s worth noting the plant is expected to create thousands of construction jobs and spinoff jobs. But the state’s $3 billion incentives offer applies only to the factory itself. Our rating Shilling said about a $3 billion incentive package being offered by the State of Wisconsin: "Foxconn tax break could exceed $1 million per job." We found in a previous fact check that the state would not be paying Foxconn $3 billion for 3,000 jobs -- or $1 million per job -- because the full $3 billion would be paid only if 13,000 jobs are created. In Shilling’s favor, if Foxconn invests at least $9 billion in its plant as it has said it will -- but hires only 1,500 workers -- the incentives paid would exceed $1 million per job. That being said, while there is not yet a commitment that Foxconn will create a minimum number of jobs, there is also no evidence that the total would be only 1,500 jobs if it invests $9 billion in its plant. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-05507	The 30 percent tax rate called for under President Barack Obama’s proposed Buffett Rule "is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/13/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-people-earning-200000-already-pay-3/	The White House has recently mounted several public events to rally support for a proposal it calls the "Buffett Rule" -- a provision that would ensure that the richest Americans wouldn’t pay federal income tax rates lower than that of middle-income Americans. During an April 12, 2012, visit to Exeter, N.H., Vice President Joe Biden focused his speech on the proposal. Here’s a portion of what Biden said: "No one who makes a million dollars or more in any single given year will pay at an effective tax rate that's less than 30 percent." Later, he added, "Anybody making a million dollars can't pay 30 percent in taxes? That's lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000." We wondered if Biden got his math right. The first thing we noticed about Biden’s speech is its definition of the Buffett Rule, which stems from billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s observation that his secretary paid a higher tax rate than he did. It differed from what appeared in a White House web page on the topic. The White House website defines the Buffett Rule without citing a specific tax rate: "No household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle class family pays," the Web page says. It turns out that the White House has filled in some of the operational details elsewhere, and the 30 percent rate is indeed what the rule would require. The president’s fiscal year 2013 budget proposal said that "those making over $1 million should pay no less than 30 percent of their income in taxes. The administration will work to ensure that this rule is implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions. And he is proposing that the Buffett rule should replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, which now burdens middle-class Americans rather than stopping the richest Americans from paying too little as was originally intended." So is it true, as Biden said, that the 30 percent tax rate "is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000." That’s a complicated question to answer. A big part of the confusion comes from Biden’s blurring how tax rates work in his speech. Currently, the federal income tax has six "brackets" -- ranges of taxable income for which there is a specified tax rate, known as the marginal rate. They are 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent. For instance, every taxpayer filing as an individual -- no matter how rich or poor -- pays a 10 percent tax rate on the first $8,700 of income. For the next $26,650, taxpayers pay 15 percent, and so on, all the way up to 35 percent for all income above $388,350. The income cutoffs are different for married couples filing jointly and for heads of households. To make this real, let’s take a look at sample taxpayers at the two income levels Biden cited -- $200,000 and $1 million -- using this Web-based tax calculator. • Individual earning $200,000. This taxpayer would be in the 33 percent tax bracket -- every dollar over $178,650 would be taxed at 33 percent. However, taking into account the lower tax rates for the dollars earned below $178,650, the effective tax rate for this filer would be just over 25 percent. • Married couple earning $200,000 filing jointly. This couple would be in the 28 percent tax bracket -- every dollar over $142,700 would be taxed at 28 percent. However, taking into account the lower tax rates for the dollars earned below $142,700, the effective tax rate for this couple would be a little under 22 percent. • Individual earning $1 million. This person would be in the 35 percent tax bracket, with an effective tax rate of 32.7 percent. • Married couple earning $1 million filing jointly. This couple would be in the 35 percent tax bracket, and their effective tax rate would be a little under 32 percent. Two issues. First, looking only at the highest marginal rates paid, Biden is correct for three of these categories and incorrect on one. Married couples earning $200,000 face a marginal tax rate of 28 percent, not 30 percent. Second, taking into account the total tax paid as a percentage of income, Biden is correct that individuals and couples making $1 million a year already face effective rates in excess of 30 percent, but individuals and couples earning $200,000 face effective rates significantly lower than 30 percent -- about 22 percent for couples and 25 percent for individuals. A married couple would have to earn $617,000 to face an effective tax rate of 30 percent, and an individual would need to earn $465,000. We should point out that these calculations assume that the taxable income in question is subject to the tax rates levied on ordinary income. In reality, many richer Americans earn a portion of income from capital gains, which are taxed less heavily than most of the ordinary income brackets -- 15 percent. So the effective tax rate for these taxpayers will be lower than the rates cited above. This is what prompted Warren Buffett to write the column that led to the Buffett Rule in the first place. But since it’s not possible for us to construct a model to gauge this factor, we won’t be including it in our discussion. Our ruling In the speech, Biden mixed and matched two different types of tax rates -- marginal tax rates, which refer to the rate paid on the last dollar of income, and effective tax rates, which refer to the percentage of income someone ultimately paid in taxes. When Biden says the rate required by the Buffett Rule "is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already," he’s comparing the percentage of income paid as taxes (the Buffett Rule) to a marginal tax rate ("the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already"). Making this comparison is mixing apples and oranges. In the meantime, if you look at the effective tax rates paid by the two groups he’s talking about, he’s right that millionaires already have an effective tax rate of at least 30 percent, assuming their income doesn’t include capital gains -- but he’s wrong when he says that taxpayers earning $200,000 do. In fact, taxpayers would have to have much higher taxable incomes before facing that rate -- $617,000 for married couples and $465,000 for individuals. Overall, Biden’s claim is a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information. We rate it Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-04-13T16:55:43	2012-04-12	['None']

pomt-13479	Says Hillary Clinton has "not answered a single question" about her immigration plan.	pants on fire!	/arizona/statements/2016/sep/09/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-hillary-clinton-has/	Donald Trump unveiled a 10-step plan in Phoenix to fix what he called a "broken" immigration system. Besides calling for an "ideological certification" of undocumented immigrants seeking citizenship, he used the platform on Aug. 31 to attack Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on immigration. "Now that you’ve heard about Hillary Clinton’s plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan," Trump said. This is not the first time Trump has taken a jab at Clinton’s responsiveness. He said in an Aug. 30 e-mail that Clinton has not had a press conference in 269 days. The former secretary of state did speak at a minority journalists convention in August, but that does not account for her dedicated press corps, so we rated Trump’s claim Mostly True. (After our fact-check appeared, Hillary Clinton did hold one, and arguably several, events that would qualify as press conferences.) But we were curious -- has Clinton failed to address immigration when asked about it? Multiple instances We did not hear back from Trump’s press office, but we found several instances in which Clinton answered questions about how she would handle immigration as commander in chief. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin provided us with multiple examples, the most recent being a Q&A during the minority journalists convention. Clinton’s first question at the event, according to Time Magazine’s transcript, was about immigration. Lori Montenegro, National Correspondent for Telemundo, asked Clinton to "walk us through" the steps of how she planned to achieve her well-known promise of proposing an immigration bill in her first 100 days as president. "How will you get immigration reform, something that President Obama was not able to do," Montenegro asked, "so that Latinos can believe that something is going to happen, that their vote, again, is not being taken for granted considering that the House, at least the House, will remain under Republican control?" Clinton’s answer was, essentially, that she hoped the Democrats retake the Senate and force the House to vote on a bipartisan bill. "I want this to be a clear, high priority for my administration. We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so," Clinton said. "I am hoping that the outcome of the election, which I am working hard to ensure a victory, will send a clear message to our Republican friends that it’s time for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform." That example alone is enough to disprove Trump’s claim. But we found more examples of Clinton explaining her immigration position in interviews and debates. During a March Democratic primary debate in Miami with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Univision’s Jorge Ramos repeatedly asked Clinton whether she would deport certain types of undocumented immigrants. From the transcript: Ramos: "So you will stop those deportations." Clinton: "I would stop…" Ramos: "The deportations for children…" Clinton: "Yes." Ramos: "... and those who don't have a criminal record." Clinton: "Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do." Clinton also sat down with Vox editor Ezra Klein in June. He asked her several questions on immigration, including whether more documented immigrants would help America’s economy. "I think we have to look at all of these issues -- comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here: how we would regularize them, what kind of steps they’d have to go through," Clinton said. "Because I believe they do have to meet certain standards if they’re going to be on a path to citizenship." Clinton also took some media questions when she visited the Jackson Diner, an Indian buffet in the immigrant-heavy Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, N.Y., on April 4, 2016. A transcript can be found here. And, there are several examples dating back to last year, including a October 2015 interview with Telemundo in which Clinton told María Celeste Arrarás about a 100-day timeline to review immigration. "I want to see comprehensive immigration reform. And I'm going to do everything I can as soon as I get into office to push on that," Clinton said. We have written about Clinton’s immigration plan previously. It calls for encouraging immigrants to become citizens, changing detention policies and using legislation to create a path to citizenship for the undocumented population. Our ruling Trump said Clinton has "not answered a single question" about her immigration plan. We quickly found several instances of Clinton answering multiple questions about her immigration plan. Trump’s claim is ridiculous and unfounded.

pomt-08709	Says the federal agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid will disburse $803 billion in benefits this year, making "it larger than all but 15 of the world's economies."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/04/michael-mccaul/rep-michael-mccaul-says-cms-will-disburse-803-bill/	Republicans balked at President Barack Obama's July decision to appoint the top federal administrator for Medicaid and Medicare without a congressional hearing, saying Congress deserved the chance to quiz the appointee, Donald Berwick, on how he intends to manage the federal behemoth called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Later that month, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, chimed in with a financial reason he wishes Berwick had undergone a public grilling: "The CMS will disburse $803 billion in benefits this fiscal year, which makes it larger than all but 15 of the world’s economies." The U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, which publishes policy papers for GOP senators to consider, had said as much weeks earlier. McCaul serves on a similar panel advising House Republicans. We wondered whether McCaul's international comparison was on point. In its cost estimates for fiscal 2010, CMS notes that it distributes "more benefits than any other federal agency" — $803.1 billion in this fiscal year that runs through September. A CMS spokeswoman told us that figure still holds. Mike Rosen, a McCaul spokesman, pointed us to the International Monetary Fund, which publishes a report twice a year — most recently in April — analyzing global economic developments, including data on inflation, unemployment and countries' gross domestic product. The IMF estimated that this year, the United States has the largest GDP among 182 other countries, $14.79 trillion, followed by China ($5.36 trillion), Japan ($5.27 trillion) and Germany ($3.32 trillion). By that yardstick, Rosen said, CMS's annual spending would rank 16th among those countries, behind Korea's gross domestic product ($991 billion) and ahead of the Netherlands ($797 billion). Paul Van de Water, an analyst at Washington's liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed the CMS would rank 16th — the new health care law has little effect on Medicare and Medicaid spending this year — but said the billions in benefits merit some perspective. "The United States is a big country, and health care is much more expensive in the U.S. than anywhere else, so it's not surprising that health care for the elderly, disabled and poor costs a lot of money," Van de Water said. The United States has the world's third-largest population, according to the CIA World Factbook, behind China and India. "U.S. government spending on national defense and homeland security will total about $750 billion this year; that number exceeds a lot of foreign GDPs, too, but the comparison provides no information about appropriate defense policy." Van de Water said a more reasonable benchmark is the size of the U.S. economy. CMS "estimates that total health care spending in the U.S., for all people and programs, in calendar year 2010 will equal 17.3 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product," he said. "Of that amount, federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to equal 5.3 percent of GDP." Defense spending: also about 5 percent. Thomas Saving, an economist and director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University, agreed the GDP comparison would be more valuable. He noted that total health care expenditures in Japan, which has the world's the third-largest GDP, are about 9 percent of its GDP — or about half the U.S. ratio. Saving said McCaul's "comparison has no useful information," pointing out that the population of the smaller economies are tiny when compared to the populations in countries with the largest GDPs — or states, for that matter. "Another not useful fact is that (national) CMS benefits are smaller than the Texas state GDP," he added. "Social Security benefits are 4.8 percent of the U.S. GDP — also larger than most of the world's economies," Saving said. "We are a big country in population and a rich country in per-capita GDP. Offering a less critical take, Brian Blase, a health policy analyst from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, said McCaul's comparison illustrates a bigger point: "The U.S. spends an awful lot on health care, primarily on Medicaid and Medicare. We spend more (total) on health care for seniors and poor people than most of the other countries could spend if they spent all their income." However, Blase agreed McCaul's claim is "somewhat misleading" and said "if you really want to do a comparison, you want to put it in per capita terms." How come? Gross numbers can be misleading without context. For instance, China recently passed Japan as the country with the second highest GDP, but it's "nowhere close to as wealthy as Japan right now because Japan's population is a fraction of the population of China," he said. Rosen of McCaul's office stood by the congressman's statement in an e-mail: "We were not comparing our health care expenditures to that of other countries... The numbers are the numbers. 16th is 16th." Our take? True, the CMS is poised to spend some $800 billion this year, more money than the size of all but 15 nations' economies. But this dramatic point isn't a meaningful comparison, because it lacks any context — such as spending per person — that puts the numbers in perspective. We rate McCaul's statement Half True.

pomt-13839	"(Big banks) have invested over $300,000 in (Joe Heck), and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/jul/12/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-releases-misleading-tv-ad-agai/	A pro-Democratic Super PAC with close ties to Nevada Sen. Harry Reid is spending roughly $850,000 on a new ad attempting to paint Republican Rep. Joe Heck as a creature of Wall Street. Senate Majority PAC’s new ad suggests that banks "invested" in the Republican Senate hopeful through campaign donations, and that their investment paid off. "They’ve invested over $300,000 in him, and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks," the ad states. This ad marks one of the largest chunks of outside spending in the highly competitive Nevada Senate race. But claiming banks invested in Heck and then received tax breaks takes an acrobatic chronology of what actually happened. Donations Over his entire congressional career, Heck has actually raised more than the $300,000 amount from the banking industry referenced in the ad. The most recent figure from the "secruities and investment" category on the nonpartisan opensecrets.org is $473,819. However, this is a career-wide total, and it includes the $381,700 raised for his ongoing Senate run. Heck raised $92,119, a much more modest figure, for his other three congressional runs combined. That’s a lot of money, but it’s worth taking the typically massive size of congressional fundraising hauls into consideration. For example, Heck’s $35,472 in donations from the "securities and investment" industry during his successful 2014 re-election bid is a drop in the bucket compared to the total $2.4 million raised throughout that campaign. And as for references to "investing," the tax breaks mentioned in the ad actually refer to a bill Heck championed as a state senator — years before the $300,000 in donations referenced in the ad. Heck did take campaign funds from banks and their associated PACs during this time. A PolitiFact tally found that Heck received around $21,800 from the banking industry through his four years in the state Senate. Again, that isn’t a small figure, but it’s a much smaller amount than what Heck raked in from the state’s casino giants and the medical industry over the same time period. Tax breaks Regardless of the donations, Heck did sponsor an ultimately failed piece of legislation in the state Senate that sought to reduce the payroll tax burden on Nevada financial institutions — what the ad calls "$44 million in tax breaks for banks." Though the ad prominently features a looming image of the U.S. Capitol Dome, the bill would have only applied to Nevada banks. We’ve previously explored the somewhat confusing history of Nevada’s payroll tax (also called the Modified Business Tax, or MBT), created as a compromise to fund new K-12 education programs during a fierce 2003 battle over new taxes. State lawmakers historically fiddle with the exact rates and exemptions levels for the payroll tax, but there has been one constant — banks and other financial institutions are charged at a higher rate than any other business (2 percent), and also pay so-called "franchise taxes" for each branch office past the first one in each county ($7,000 a year). Nevada bankers have long grumbled about the higher tax rates, and have attempted to reduce them back down to the level paid by other state businesses, most recently in 2015. That’s what Heck was doing in 2007 when he introduced SB 233, which proposed rolling back the payroll tax rate on banks to the level applied to other state businesses and repealing the "franchise tax" for multiple branch offices. Saying the bill was about "equity and fairness," Heck argued that the higher rate applied to banks created more tax revenue than projected and stifled the industry’s economic growth. "This could be a bill about basket weavers," he said at a committee hearing. "This bill is about an inequitable system that singles out an industry for a tax the rest of business and industry does not pay." Democrats on the committee said banks were uniquely prepared to handle a higher tax burden, and that they weren’t suffering at the time despite the higher taxes. "I have not seen a bank go out of business in this state; the banks I am aware of are setting record profits," Democratic state Sen. Mike Schneider said during a hearing on the bill. As for the tax-cut figure, both the state’s Taxation Department and Heck himself estimated the legislation would cost the state around $44.2 million in revenue — a little more than $38 million in payroll taxes and another $5.9 million by axing the branch franchise tax. Heck pointed out that those cuts would make up less than 1 percent of the state’s $6.9 billion two-year budget. The bill itself would have affected around 2,450 Nevada businesses at the time, and the amended version would have lowered the tax for the 55,000 businesses paying the payroll levy. Heck wasn’t the only Republican leading the charge on reducing the tax burden for banks, as former Gov. Jim Gibbons made repealing the bank franchise tax a priority in his 2007 State of the State address. Ultimately, the bill went nowhere. After being amended and passed out of committee, Senate leaders placed it in legislative limbo and let it expire without any more votes. Although lawmakers approved major changes to the state’s payroll tax in 2015, the higher rate on financial institutions hasn’t changed since 2003. Senate Majority PAC spokesman Shripal Shah said the measure indicated to the banking industry that Heck would be in their corner if elected to Senate. "Banks have invested in Joe Heck's campaigns because they know he has a history of working for their interests and would continue doing their bidding in the Senate if he has the opportunity," he said in an email. Regardless, this isn’t the first time Heck’s opponents have tried to ding him over the proposal. Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus criticized him over it during a 2010 debate between the two House candidates. Heck responded with largely the same language he used in testifying for the bill in 2007, saying the point was to make the state’s tax system more equitable. Our ruling A new ad from Senate Majority PAC claims banks "have invested over $300,000 in him, and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks." The implication that funds raised from the banking industry were an "investment" in Heck is highly misleading. The majority of bank donations came during Heck’s current run for U.S. Senate, nine years after sponsoring a bill that would have lowered the payroll tax rate for banks. Because it’s so misleading, we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2016-07-12T17:25:16	2016-07-01	['Joe_Heck']

pomt-00713	Said President Barack Obama "said he was going to stop (signature strikes)."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/28/richard-clarke/did-obama-pledge-stop-using-signature-strikes/	The White House recently disclosed that the two hostages -- one American and one Italian -- were killed in January by an American "signature strike" aimed at al-Qaida terrorists. A signature strike is a type of drone strike, in which the United States targets people they believe to be militants, though they don’t know the exact identity of the target. Some have criticized the government’s use of such strikes because they run a higher risk of hitting innocent parties. Government officials told the Wall Street Journal that signature strikes have been effective for killing high-value targets, especially in regions where it’s hard to locate al-Qaida leaders. But the continued use of signature strikes goes against what President Barack Obama said he was going to do, said ABC News security consultant Richard Clarke, who spent 30 years working in government, including 10 years in the White House, before leaving in 2003. "When you do these signature strikes, meaning by definition, you don't know who you are killing, you just know the facility looks like an al-Qaida facility," Clarke said on ABC This Week April 27. "When you do signature strikes, that's very risky. And President Obama said he was going to stop them, and clearly he didn't." Obama has relied heavily on drones -- nearly 2,500 people have been killed in covert drone strikes since Obama took office, according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism, which tracks strikes. We wondered if Obama had gone back on what he said. Did he say he was going to stop signature strikes? Vague guidelines Clarke didn’t respond to several requests for comment. But we dug through Obama’s statements over the years, as well as campaign materials. We couldn’t find any instance in which Obama literally said he was going to stop using signature strikes. Clarke’s claim might stem from a May 2013 speech Obama delivered at the National Defense University, where he discussed vague drone policies. In the speech, Obama announced that he had signed a "presidential policy guidance" document where he codified a "framework that governs our use of force against terrorists." Although the event and document were widely seen as a shift to more restrictions on drone strikes, concrete details about the shift were almost nonexistent. The presidential policy guidance document itself is not publicly available, and the related fact sheet does not address drone strikes, much less signature strikes. A heckler in the audience asked specifically what Obama was planning to do about signature strikes, but he did not respond. An unnamed member of the Obama administration debriefed reporters on the shift, and one reporter asked, "Will signature strikes explicitly be prohibited now?" "I don’t want to get into the details of any specific strike," the official responded, though he went on to say "the type of strikes we’ve taken generally" would eventually be phased out. "Given the two principal changing circumstances in our effort against terrorism -- the winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the demise of al-Qaida core -- the need for the types of strikes that we’ve taken generally over the course of the last several years will be reduced over time," the official said. (Obama has since extended the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.) Following the briefing, the New York Times reported that the codified standards "could signal" an end to signature strikes -- not that they would unequivocally. They also reported that officials said signature trikes would certainly continue in Pakistan, where the two men were killed. In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the CIA drone program in Pakistan is generally exempt from the 2013 policy guidelines, at least while the United States continues some level of operations in Afghanistan. At the time, Benjamin Wittes, a national security expert and editor of the Lawfare blog, wrote that it was unclear from Obama’s remarks and the coverage whether or not Obama actually narrowed the criteria for targeting people in drone strikes -- because the language was so opaque. Now -- two years later -- Wittes told PolitiFact, "I don't think it's fair to say that Obama promised to end signature strikes." Our ruling Clarke said, "President Obama said he was going to stop (signature strikes)." As far as we can tell, Obama has never said himself that he would stop signature drone strikes, which killed two western civilian hostages. An unnamed administration official implied that signature strikes would eventually be phased out, though without any details. In any case, the drone program in Pakistan, which killed the hostages, was generally exempt from these rules. Clarke’s claim suggests that Obama did something he said he wouldn’t do anymore, but that isn’t the case. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02477	On oil drilling off Florida’s coast	no flip	/florida/statements/2014/feb/20/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-mostly-opposed-oil-drilling-except-2/	In April 2010, Deepwater Horizon exploded, resulting in a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The spill raised questions about policy positions on oil drilling for several politicians, including then Gov. Charlie Crist. At the time of the spill, Crist was struggling in a Republican U.S. Senate primary against soon-to-be Sen. Marco Rubio; he ended up switching to "no party affiliation." In 2013, Crist announced that he was running for governor again -- this time as a Democrat. We decided to look back at Crist’s statements on oil drilling through his tenure and place them on our Flip-O-Meter, which evaluates whether a politician actually changed position. We leave it to voters to decide the significance of our findings. 1998-2008 Overall, Crist expressed opposition to drilling throughout much of his career, from state senator to education commissioner to U.S. Senate candidate to attorney general. A sampling: June 20, 1998, in a Florida Times-Union interview during his first U.S. Senate campaign against Bob Graham: "Having grown up here, it's hard not to feel strongly about the beauty that is Florida. I would and already have fought offshore drilling in Florida, and would continue that fight in Florida." An Oct. 10, 2006, interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board: "Offshore oil drilling, I'm adamantly opposed to it. I think a lot of that has to do with growing up here. I'm a Gulf Coast guy. ... I remember when I was in elementary school, we had an oil spill in Tampa Bay. You may recall that. I literally remember cleaning birds off when that happened." Oct. 20, 2006, at a press conference, on the qualities Floridians want in a president: "Making sure that we don’t drill for oil off our beautiful shore, and, of course, the other traditional things that go along with it." In his inaugural address as governor in January 2007, Crist called for "clean rivers, beautiful beaches and coastlines free of oil drilling. This is a vision we can make a reality." Crist as vice presidential contender in 2008 In 2008, with gasoline prices hovering near $4 a gallon and Crist being mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate (on a ticket that would popularize the phrase "drill, baby, drill!"), Crist backed off his previous unflinching opposition. After Republican presidential contender John McCain gave a June 17 speech in Houston calling for opening up more waters to drilling, Crist said: "We have to be sympathetic to the pocketbooks of Floridians and what they're paying at the pump for gas and balance that with any way that our state might be able to contribute in terms of resources to have a greater supply and therefore lower prices," Crist said. "I think an open-minded person understands that we ought to at least study (offshore drilling)." Crist offered some caveats at the time: "It would all depend on the parameters," he said. "How far off the coast, how safe it would be, how much it would protect our beaches." To environmentalists and Democratic leaders, Crist’s statement was a major reversal. "It seemed that he would be the last person to change course on this," said Eric Draper, policy director for Audubon of Florida, at the time. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, called Crist's position "a 180-degree flip-flop." "I don’t understand Gov. Crist’s Flip-Flop on this," she said. "The risk to our environment and to our economy -- I mean the governor, of all people, should know better." The next week Crist delivered a speech at a global climate change summit in Miami. "We must have an open discussion – without compromising Florida’s sensitive ecosystems and natural beauty," Crist said of offshore drilling. "As I stated last week, only when we are able to do so far enough from Florida’s coast, safe enough for our people and clean enough for our beaches, should we consider increasing our oil supply by drilling off Florida’s shores. Let me repeat that – far enough, safe enough and clean enough." Crist witnesses 2010 spill But in 2010, after flying over the gulf and seeing the Deepwater Horizon spill firsthand, Crist withdrew his support for any form of drilling off Florida's coasts. "It could be devastating to Florida if something like that were to occur," Crist said. "It's the last thing in the world I would want to see happen in our beautiful state." Crist also repeated the criteria laid out in his 2008 climate change address, saying the gulf spill proved drilling isn't yet far enough away, clean enough, or safe enough. "Clearly that one isn't far enough, and that's about 50 to 60 miles out, it's clearly not clean enough after we saw what we saw today - that's horrific - and it certainly isn't safe enough. It's the opposite of safe," Crist said. Crist summoned legislators to a special session in July with hopes that they would put an oil drilling ban on the November 2010 ballot. But the Republican-dominated Legislature delivered him a defeat within hours of convening. Post 2010 Crist lost his U.S. Senate race in 2010 and Republican Rick Scott became the governor. In February 2011, Crist returned to Tallahassee to stand with Democrat Alex Sink and environmentalists to announce his support for a state constitutional amendment to ban oil drilling. "This puts it in the hands of the people and that’s exactly where it should be," Crist said. At an October 2012 gathering with several former governors, Crist said Florida shouldn’t consider oil drilling. He declared the BP oil spill to be "the greatest wake-up call of all time." "There are just too many other ways to produce energy — solar, wind, things that the Sunshine State of all places should be leading in," he said, according to the Gainesville Sun. Crist announced in November 2013 that he would run for governor again. In an interview with Watermark, a central Florida publication that covers the gay community, a reporter asked Crist if elected if he would continue to support the ban on offshore drilling. "Yes," Crist replied in the interview published in December. "How could you be governor during the BP oil spill and not get that right. That was a wake-up call." We sent a summary of our findings to Crist’s campaign and received a response from former sen. Steve Geller, a Democrat advising Crist. Geller said the BP oil spill convinced Crist that nothing near Florida would be "safe enough, far enough, and clean enough." Did Crist flip? For most of his career Crist has opposed offshore oil drilling in Florida. He spoke against drilling repeatedly between 1998 and 2006. But in 2008, he was a potential Republican vice presidential contender amid high gas prices. At that time, Crist said Florida should study drilling and have an "open discussion" about it -- though in a speech he offered caveats that it would have to be "far enough, safe enough and clean enough." Even that suggestion was enough to anger environmentalists, but in the end that’s all it amounted to -- a suggestion to study it. The 2010 explosion put the lid on that discussion for Crist, and he again returned to his adamant stance against drilling -- a position he has reiterated as recently as late 2013. Crist did wobble in 2008, but ultimately he went back to his original position so we rate him No Flip.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-02-20T11:54:13	2014-02-12	['None']
pomt-05192	Most tips left at Dunkin’ Donuts don’t go to employees.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/13/christopher-blazejewski/rep-christopher-blazejewski-says-most-dunkin-donut/	On June 5, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill, H7566, intended to prevent employers from taking a cut of the tips that customers give to food service and other employees. When one state representative asked during a hearing on the bill what effect it would have on the tips she gave at her local Dunkin' Donuts or Honey Dew Donuts, the chief sponsor, Rep. Christopher Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat, said that wasn't an issue because most such stores prohibit tips for workers. "You wouldn't know this, but they don't get that money," Blazejewski said. "That money actually, as a policy at Dunkin’ Donuts, generally speaking most of the stores prohibit tipping. And those that prohibit tipping and (if) the person receives the money . . . it is given to charity. So you'll notice that little box out front when you pay for your coffee, it will be some sort of 503(c) charity. Any money given in excess of your purchase price will be donated to that charity." The bill, which had been amended at the last minute to exempt "quick service restaurants" such as Dunkin' Donuts, then passed overwhelmingly. It is now before the Senate Labor Committee. Blazejewski's statement caught us by surprise, especially when, a few days later, we stopped by a Warwick store and noticed that the big tip jar on the counter clearly stated that the money was for employees. It made us wonder about our visits to Dunkin' Donuts: Is it worth the tip? Was Rep. Blazejewski correct and did the company really prohibit tipping? We called the headquarters. The company sent us a statement from Jessica Gioglio, public relations and social media manager, saying that there is no overarching policy. "Dunkin' Donuts restaurants are independently owned and operated by franchisees who are responsible for making the business decisions, including hours of operation, employee wages and tipping policy," the statement said. "Many franchisees allow their employees to accept tips. Other franchisees prefer to offer customers the opportunity to donate their change to charitable causes." Spokeswoman Kate Barba added, "We don't have a way to determine the number of stores that allow tipping." When we called Blazejewski, he said he got his information from Chris Hunter of the lobbying/public relations firm Advocacy Solutions, located in Providence. Hunter, in turn, told us Blazejewski "might have misspoken in saying they don't accept tips." He sent us a statement from Chris Prazeres, chairman of the Dunkin' Donuts Independent Franchise Owners of Rhode Island Roundtable, saying roughly 70 percent of the approximately 160 stores in Rhode Island accept tips. Some Dunkin' Donuts owners had been concerned about the legislation, said Hunter, because they didn't want it to interfere with their ability to collect money for charity. Blazejewski subsequently sent a letter on June 12, 2012, to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor, which received his bill after it passed the House, asking him to remove the amendment that exempted Dunkin' Donuts and similar stores. That was the last day of the 2012 session and the bill never made it out of committee. "We were provided with inaccurate and misleading information by Dunkin' Donuts' affiliates and are deeply troubled by it," he said in a statement to PolitiFact. "I have asked the Senate to remove the floor amendment language and pass the prior version of the bill, which was always intended to prevent consumer fraud as well as protect wait staff and service employees who rely on tips to survive in an extremely difficult economy." Time to make our ruling Rep. Christopher Blazejewski told the House that most Dunkin' Donuts workers don't receive tips because the company, as a policy, generally prohibits tipping. Dunkin' Donuts told us the company has no such policy, and the decision about whether to let workers keep their tips, or give that money to charity, is up to each store owner. A spokesman for Rhode Island franchise owners said Blazejewski misspoke and that about 70 percent of the stores allow workers to get tips. Blazejewski said "inaccurate and misleading information" from Rhode Island store owners led him to support the amendment that exempted such stores. Blazejewski may have gotten inaccurate information, but we base our ruling on the accuracy of the statement, not its source. We rate his statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-10555	"On issue after issue that really were hard to explain or understand, you voted present . . . And anytime anyone raises that, there's always some kind of explanation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/13/hillary-clinton/yes-but-its-complicated/	Trying to depict her chief rival as calculating and wishy-washy, Sen. Hillary Clinton says Sen. Barack Obama ducked tough votes over eight years as an Illinois state senator by voting "present" instead of "yea" or "nay" 129 times on bills dealing with issues including abortion rights, gun control and the privacy of sex-abuse victims. She questions whether Obama would be capable of making tough choices in the Oval Office. "On issue after issue that really were hard to explain or understand, you voted present . . . And anytime anyone raises that, there's always some kind of explanation," Clinton said in her most direct attack, during a Jan. 21 Democratic debate in South Carolina. Indeed, Obama regularly exercised this option during his time in the Springfield state house, though he did so in a chamber where voting "present" is a common strategic maneuver. Moreover, Obama clearly articulated his position on issues such as abortion before and after the votes. "Everyone I've spoken to who's familiar with this, including lobbyists and people who are engaged in opposition research, say the number of times he voted present on a proportional basis was probably a little less than average," said Christopher Mooney, a political scientist at the University of Illinois at Springfield. Obama had no such worries coming from a solidly Democratic district on Chicago's south side. But his aides and political allies say he provided strategic cover for other Democrats by voting present on Republican proposals. It worked like this: Republicans controlled the state Senate for much of Obama's tenure and GOP leaders often forced votes on social issues such as abortion restrictions that put some Democrats in swing districts in a difficult position. By voting "present," Obama, a known abortion rights proponent who represented a safe Democratic district, made it more acceptable for Democrats in swing districts to vote present as well, sparing them the pain of a straight "no" vote that would open them up to election-year attacks. And a "present" vote could sometimes work as well as a "no" in stalling legislation. The down side to all this maneuvering is that Obama is seen as having shown up but not taken a position on measures such as a proposal to allow juveniles as young as 15 to be tried as adults if they committed a crime with a firearm near or on school grounds. He similarly voted present on a bill to prevent sex-related shops from opening near schools or houses of worship, which ultimately did not become law, and on a measure to ban a procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion that passed the Senate. He was the lone present vote on bills to protect the privacy of sex-assault victims and to impose tougher requirements on individuals seeking to adopt children. Pam Sutherland, president and chief executive officer of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said she asked Obama to vote "present" on several bills that proposed narrowing abortion rights – including a package of bills to expand legal protections to infants born alive at any stage of development, including if the birth occurred in the process of an abortion – in order to persuade centrist Democrats and even some moderate Republicans to do the same. "He said, 'You know, I am a no vote on these bills,' and I said, 'You know they respect you and if you vote present, it will be easier for them to vote present,'" Sutherland said. "Because people were consistently voting present, the Senate president stopped putting (attack) mailers out to those districts." The record is clear that Obama did vote "present" more than 100 times (we couldn't confirm the 129 figure because records for one session of the state senate during his tenure aren't available electronically). That's out of more than 4,000 votes cast. On many of those votes, Obama was joined by many in his party, making it clear that he was, as he claims, casting votes as part of a broader legislative strategy. But there are several other instances in which he is one of only a few senators to vote "present," and at least eight where he was the only senator to vote "present." In those cases, it's hard to see the party's fingerprints on his position, and it's easier to see political expedience. Ultimately, the record is mixed, leaving us little room for more than Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-13T00:00:00	2008-01-21	['None']
pomt-13745	"We are the only industrialized nation that doesn't guarantee workers paid family leave."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/	New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand put Hillary Clinton’s stance on women’s issues front and center at the first night of the Democratic National Convention. Gillibrand offered Clinton as a person who would bring America into the 21st century, and played off a popular television series about advertising executives in the 1960s where women were relegated to making coffee. "Our policies are stuck in the Mad Men era," she said. "We are the only industrialized nation that does not guarantee workers paid family leave. Many women can't even get a paid day off to give birth." Gillibrand’s comparison of America to the rest of the industrialized nations is a familiar Democratic talking point. Bernie Sanders has said it. So has President Barack Obama. Twice. The claim rates Mostly True, and here’s why. What America has Under the Family Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. There are a couple of exceptions. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes. Some employers choose to provide paid maternity leave, but that touches only about 13 percent of workers according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What other countries have The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development studied paid maternity leave for about 34 OECD countries -- advanced nations -- and seven additional European Union countries. On average across OECD countries, mothers are entitled to 17 weeks of paid maternity leave. The United States is the only country with no national law to provide that benefit. According to the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, the United States and New Guinea are the two countries out of 170 that provide no cash benefits of any kind to women during maternity leave. Of the 41 other developed countries highlighted by the report, the United States also mandates the shortest period of time off — 12 weeks. Parents do particularly well in Australia and the United Kingdom, where they are eligible for a full year, although not all of that is paid leave. The main caveat when looking at other nations is that some of them limit who is eligible. In Canada, temporary workers can’t get cash benefits. Canada also excludes migrant workers and people who own more than 40 percent of their business. Norway and Switzerland exclude home workers, and some civil servants don’t get any benefits in Japan. The International Labor Organization sets a standard for what countries should provide in a benefits package: 1) Women should receive at least 14 weeks off; 2) They should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings; and 3) The benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or Social Security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks (and one of just 14 studied worldwide that didn’t check off any of the three). But six other countries fall short of at least one goal. Our ruling Gillibrand said that America is the only industrialized that doesn't guarantee workers paid family leave. If you don’t live in one of two states that require paid family leave, or work for an employer that voluntarily offers it, you can take time off when a little one arrives, but you won’t get paid. All other developed countries surveyed by the International Labor Organization mandate at least some paid maternity leave. Another international study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found the same thing. There are some exclusions and limits in some countries, so the benefit is not universal. On balance, the statement holds up and we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1644f61-7467-4b83-bced-b2c7ac9f3126	None	Kirsten Gillibrand	None	None	None	2016-07-25T22:19:00	2016-07-25	['None']

pomt-05508	Says the Pentagon has never passed a financial audit. In fact, the Pentagon is exempt from a federal law that requires all federal agencies to complete annual audits.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/13/peter-defazio/defazio-says-pentagon-cant-track-its-budget-we-aud/	At $530 billion this fiscal year, the budget for the Department of Defense is the federal government’s largest agency and third biggest spending item, trailing only the amount spent on Social Security and the two big health programs Medicare and Medicaid. Even so, the Pentagon and its friends in the White House and in Congress keep asking for more. (The fiscal 2013 budget released by the White House reduces defense spending to $525 billion in 2013 before boosting it to $534 billion in 2014 and $546 billion in 2015. The budget proposal written by House Republicans calls for $554 billion for defense next year.) Having a budget for the Pentagon is a curious thing, according to Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. The reason? The Pentagon, he says, has no idea how much money it actually has or how much it actually spends or wastes. The reason, DeFazio says, is both obvious and outrageous. "Despite the fact that the Pentagon is the largest and most expensive department in the federal government, it has never passed a financial audit," he says on his House website. "In fact, under current law, the Pentagon is exempt from a federal law that requires all federal agencies to complete annual audits." What? Really? At a time when politicians and voters alike are obsessed with deficits and government spending, the agency with the biggest annual budget - by far - has never been able to fully audit its spending and isn’t required to do so? Let’s take a look. The best place to start is 1990, when Congress passed legislation requiring all federal agencies to present "auditable financial statements." It was a reasonable standard for most agencies to satisfy and every federal department did, except one: the Pentagon. The Pentagon has promised to create a system to make its books "auditable" by 2017. Congress accepted the pledge, which was an estimate rather than a hard "mandate." It’s important to note that auditing your books is a two-step process. First, as any business person knows, you have to have a system in place to track income and expenses and other parts of your budget. Meeting that goal makes you "auditable." Once there, you can have an audit that provides a detailed thumbnail of your financial well-being. The Pentagon hasn’t accomplished either one. DeFazio sponsored an amendment to the defense bill last year that requires the Pentagon to organize its books so they can be audited. That step has yet to be satisfied and DeFazio’s measure was stripped during negotiations between the House and Senate. Independent reports of the Pentagon’s problems monitoring its budgets continue to pile up. As far back as 1995, the General Accountability Office, the independent investigative arm of Congress, deemed the Pentagon’s financial management to be "high risk." In 2000, the GAO found that nearly one third of the accounting entries in the Pentagon's budget were untraceable. In 2009, the GAO said its auditors "have continued to report significant weaknesses in the department’s ability to provide timely, reliable, consistent, and accurate information for management analysis, decision-making, and reporting." The next year, the GAO found that half of the Pentagon's $366 billion in contract awards were never even completed. And in yet another 2010 report, the GAO found that the Pentagon’s effort to install a system to make itself "auditable" were taking on the personality of a new weapons system - over budget and behind schedule. In this case, the GAO said that two-thirds of the systems the Department of Defense is putting in place to make its budget auditable have slipped years in implementation and doubled in cost -- to more than $13 billion. The GAO also showed why the ability of the Pentagon to audit itself is important. Among the problems: The Army can’t be sure that it doesn’t overdraw its personnel expenditures account, which funds soldier pay, enlistment bonuses and other benefits; The Defense Department still can’t "reliably identify, aggregate and report the full cost of its investment" in weapons systems — currently estimated at more than $1 trillion — and doesn’t have enough information to manage and reduce the billions it spends each year on weapons operations and support costs; Databases tracking hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Army property are improperly managed. The Pentagon does not dispute DeFazio’s claim. In an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee in March, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta declared that the department would be fully auditable by 2014 instead of waiting until 2017. He acknowledged it’s "crazy" that the department is still unable to audit its finances. "That's, frankly, something we owe the taxpayer," he said. Therefore, with the audit of DeFazio’s statement complete, we rate his claim: True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-08109	State employees in Wisconsin earn "about 8 percent less" than if they worked in the private sector.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/12/bryan-kennedy/union-leader-says-wisconsin-state-employees-earn-a/	Targeted by Governor-elect Scott Walker, state employee unions in Wisconsin dominated the headlines in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel during the first days of December 2010. Dec. 3: Walker targets early strike at state worker benefits Dec. 7: Walker looks at showdown with state employee unions Dec. 8: GOP leader floats right-to-work law The common theme: Walker and other Republicans, confronted with a state budget deficit of about $3 billion, want to cut state employee benefits. Feeling the fire, union leader Bryan Kennedy stood up for state workers in a recent interview on WISN-TV in Milwaukee. On the "Upfront with Mike Gousha" public affairs program, Gousha asked Kennedy if state employee unions "have a perception problem with the general public." "Well, I think that there's been talking points used by those who don't like government to continually bash us and make us look as if we're the haves and we're really not," Kennedy replied during the Dec. 5, 2010 show. "If you look across the board, we're averaging about 8 percent less than if we all worked in the private sector. Some of our people make half or a third as much as they could make if they worked in the private sector." Kennedy is president of the Wisconsin chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, known as AFT-Wisconsin. Despite its name, the union represents only a fraction of Wisconsin’s school teachers. Its 17,000 members include university and technical college faculty as well as a variety of other white-collar workers, including professionals such as nurses and lawyers, in state and local government. Kennedy’s 8 percent number is awful specific. So we decided to take a look. When we asked the basis for his statement, he provided two reports released in 2010 by two Washington, D.C., organizations. Both studies compared state and private-sector employees taking into account differences in education, years of experience and other factors. That’s important because, on the whole, the average government worker has more education and earns a higher salary than a private-sector worker. The first report, by the Economic Policy Institute, found that state workers across the country are paid 11 percent less than private-sector workers. The difference is 7.6 percent less, the report said, if pay plus benefits are considered. Kennedy described the 7.6 percent figure to PolitiFact Wisconsin as a "pay differential." He said he simply rounded it up to 8 percent in the Gousha interview. Two problems here: Kennedy’s statement referred to pay, but he cited a number that covers pay and benefits. Kennedy actually would have been better off citing the 11 percent figure, which referred to pay only -- except that figure is a national one and the study did not provide any statistics for Wisconsin. The second report -- done by two University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors for the National Institute of Retirement Security, whose board is largely composed of representatives of public employee pensions -- also was national in scope. But it did provide one Wisconsin statistic: From 2000 to 2008, the wages of state employees was 6.2 percent less than for private-sector employees. Two more problems there: The 6.2 percent differential is less than the 8 percent cited by Kennedy -- off by nearly one-fourth. And the figure is an average for 2000-2008, while Kennedy’s statement referred to current compensation. Beyond that, in his statement, Kennedy cited state employee pay. But when comparing state and private-sector workers, it is crucial to assess not only pay but benefits. Historically, said UWM economics professor John Heywood, co-author of the second study cited by Kennedy, public employee unions have accepted lower pay in exchange for more generous benefits. National studies, he said, have confirmed that state workers earn less but get higher benefits than private-sector employees -- although the overall difference is hard to calculate partly because benefits are complicated. Indeed, many union leaders -- when defending higher benefits for public employees -- often point to the trade-off Heywood references: Higher benefits, but lower pay. So, it’s ironic to now have the argument that low pay is the problem, without an acknowledgment of the higher benefits. When it comes to benefits, pensions are often cited as more generous for government employees. In Wisconsin, that disparity was highlighted in a February 2010 study by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank. The study, done by an actuarial firm, calculated that a state employee in Wisconsin who earns $48,000 a year would retire with an estimated monthly pension benefit of $1,712. That is $411 more than a private-sector employee who earned $70,000 a year. There are other sorts of benefits, of course, including health care and vacation time. So what to make of Kennedy’s statement? He said Wisconsin state employees are "averaging about 8 percent less" in pay than if they worked in the private sector. But the figure he relied on was from a national study that combined pay and benefits. A second study focused on state workers and pay, but it didn’t come out to 8 percent. What’s more, Kennedy’s statement skips a key point -- one union leaders have made over the years -- that pay is lower because benefits are higher. In sum, Kennedy did not provide evidence that supports his claim, which itself provides only a partial look at the debate. If any more evidence emerges, we’ll review it. In the meantime, we rate Kennedy’s claim False.	None	Bryan Kennedy	None	None	None	2010-12-12T09:00:00	2010-12-05	['Wisconsin']

A May 16, 2016, story posted on ThatViralFeed.net announces "Pro-Lifers Declare ‘Ejaculation Is Murder: Every Sperm Cell Is A Life’," allegedly presenting photos and quotes of people opposed to abortion. "God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just ‘waste’ that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to," a quote attributed to Rachel Stratt, who is described as a pro-life activist. "Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!" The quote is fake. The story goes on to describe a Change.org petition to stop such "waste" garnering 85,000 signatures, and a fictional bill to do the same getting the support of "38 White House conservatives," all of whom are women. The petition is also fake, although the story is popular on Facebook. Users flagged the suspicious post as part of Facebook’s attempt to stop the spread of fake news.

pomt-10103	"Barack Obama's plan gives a driver's license to any illegal who wants one."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/23/national-republican-trust-pac/not-much-of-a-plan-here/	With a new television ad, a conservative group is trying to revive the debate over drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants, which flared up in the Democratic nomination race but has not been a major issue in the general election. The ad debuted on Oct. 21, 2008, and is set to run in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states, according to scriptwriter and producer Rick Wilson. "Millions of illegal aliens in the U.S.," begins the spot, paid for by an independent political action committee called the National Republican Trust. "Barack Obama's plan gives a driver's license to any illegal who wants one." For good measure, the spot includes an image of 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta on a driver's license. Since the ad made an allegation about "Obama's plan," we checked his Web site for any plan that mentioned drivers' licenses for undocumented immigrants. We couldn't find one. Obama's immigration plan doesn't have anything to say on the subject. In phone interviews, Wilson and the PAC's executive director, Scott Wheeler, pointed to comments made by Obama in three debates during the Democratic primary as evidence for the claim. In the first debate, on Oct. 30, 2007, NBC's Brian Williams asked Obama whether he was for or against a plan by then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York to grant licenses to illegal immigrants. "I think that it is a — the right idea," Obama said. "Because there is a public safety concern. We can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows, that they can be tracked, that they are properly trained, and that will make our roads safer." In another debate, on Nov. 15, 2007, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Obama, "Do you support or oppose drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants?" "I am not proposing that that's what we do," Obama said. "I have already said I support the notion that we have to deal with public safety and that drivers' licenses at the state level can make that happen. ... But what I also know, Wolf, is that if we keep on getting distracted by this problem, then we are not solving it." Blizter went on to press for a yes or no answer. "Yes," Obama said. In a third debate, on Jan. 31, 2008, Obama said: "On the drivers' license issue, I don't actually want — I don't believe that we're going to have to deal with this if we have comprehensive immigration reform because, as I said before, people don't come here to drive, they come here to work." He continued, "I agree with Bill Richardson (who supported granting drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants) that there is a public safety concern here and that we're better off — because I don't want a bunch of hit-and-run drivers because they're worried about being deported and so they don't report an accident." So yes, Obama did indeed endorse the idea of granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants. But does that amount to a "plan" to do so? In the context of the presidential campaign, we think of a "plan" as a specific course of intended action a candidate has laid out, usually in writing. Voicing support at a debate for an idea — especially couched in qualifiers such as "I don't believe that we're going to have to deal with this," and "I am not proposing that that's what we do" — is a far cry from having a plan to do so. "When we say 'Obama's plan' we're saying it's part of his plans, not necessarily that he's created a plan," Wheeler said. But it's not part of his immigration plans. We also note that drivers' licenses are handled on the state level, and Obama is running for federal office. The federal government can impose standards on states for drivers' licenses that would be federally recognized — and in fact Congress did so in 2005 when it passed elements of what had been known as the Real ID Act. It said states have to require "valid documentary evidence that the person (applying for a license) is a citizen or national of the United States" or has applied for any of several types of legal status. Obama voted for that bill, which passed 99-0. We could not find any evidence that he had a plan to change those requirements, other than his debate comments, which don't amount to much of a plan. Finally, Obama saying he favored the idea of giving drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants is different from saying he would give them to "any illegal who wants one," as the ad claimed. If Obama were to offer a specific plan on the subject, who knows what restrictions it would include? Certainly not the National Republican Trust. So this group is guilty of some serious hyperbole. It took words of support from Obama for the concept of granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants and portrayed them not just as a specific plan, but as one that would hand licenses out like candy. We find it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09584	"Right now the Tea Party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/25/dick-armey/armey-says-tea-party-more-popular-democrats-republ/	The Tea Party is getting popular -- really popular, if you ask Dick Armey, a former House Republican leader whose organization FreedomWorks helped organize the fledgling group, which has used tea bags to symbolize its opposition to new taxes. "This is the broad center of American politics," he said in an interview with MSNBC. "Look at the polling data. Right now the Tea Party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats." The Democrats and Republicans have been around awhile, so we were a little skeptical that the new party had gained such ground. We contacted FreedomWorks to find out which poll Armey was referring to and were told to check out a December 2009 NBC-Wall Street Journal poll. The poll asked the following question: "As you may know, this year saw the start of something known as the Tea Party movement. In this movement, citizens, most of whom are conservatives, participated in demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and other cities, protesting government spending, the economic stimulus package, and any type of tax increases. From what you know about this movement, is your opinion of it very positive, somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative, or very negative? If you do not know enough to have an opinion, please say so." The poll found that 41 percent of respondents had a positive view of the Tea Party movement (either somewhat or very positive), while only 23 percent saw it negatively and 21 percent were neutral and 15 percent did not have an opinion. By contrast, 28 percent viewed the Republican Party positively, 43 percent saw it negatively and 27 percent were neutral. The Democratic Party was seen positively by 35 percent, negatively by 45 percent and neutral by 19. But some political analysts have questioned whether the poll exaggerated the Tea Party's favorable ratings because the group is not well known and because of the heavy coverage it gets from Fox News, a conservative news outlet. About 76 percent of those who see the Tea Party movement favorably also said they get their news from Fox, according to an analysis on MSNBC's First Read. On Meet the Press in response to Armey's comments, NBC political editor Chuck Todd questioned whether the Tea Party was "in the center. I mean, when we did our own polling on this, it's clear that the Tea Party gets a big benefit because there's one news organization that gives them a huge bump all the time. I mean, their favorable rating among Fox viewers is through the roof, and the rest of the country sort of doesn't know a lot about these folks." PolitiFact interviewed Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and she made the same point. "We know from other polls that a lot of Americans don't know what the Tea Party is," she said. Indeed, the same NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showed that only 7 percent of respondents know a great deal about the Tea Party and 22 percent know a fair amount. Bowman also questioned the validity of comparing the parties because of the way the poll was worded. The Tea Party question included information about the group's activities such as "protesting government spending," while there were no such labels for Republicans or Democrats. "I think people were responding to deep concerns about government," she said, not necessarily the Tea Party movement. While it's clear that Republicans and Democrats are not polling well -- and that the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll provides some useful information about the mood of the country -- it doesn't show definitively that the Tea Party is the most popular party in the country, Bowman said. We also spoke with Jay Campbell, vice president for Hart McInturff, the firm that conducted the poll. For the same reasons outlined by Bowman, he told us Armey's comments were not an accurate representation of the poll's findings. "The main problem with it is that they're making a comparison that is not an apples-to-apples comparison at all," Campbell said. "If we had said that the Democratic Party was the party of the working class, they might have polled more favorably." His firm included the descriptions for the Tea Party because pollsters were concerned that respondents otherwise would not know what it is. A December 2009 Rasmussen poll also contradicts Armey's statement. It found that in a three-way generic ballot, Democrats attracted 36% of the vote. The Tea Party candidate picked up 23%, and Republicans finished third with 18% of the vote. Another 22% are undecided. And a Fox News poll released Jan. 21, 2010, demonstrated that President Barack Obama would beat a potential Tea Party candidate in a White House run. So Armey is drastically overstating the group's standing. Yes, the Tea Party is viewed favorably by people who know about the group (particularly those who get their news from Fox), but the pollsters who conducted the survey say it's not accurate to say that the party is more popular than Democrats or Republicans. Also, other polls contradict Armey's statement and indicate that Democrats are more popular than Tea Party candidates. So we find Armey's claim to be False.

pomt-01910	"Nearly 60 percent of women who use birth control do so for more than just family planning."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/30/debbie-wasserman-schultz/after-supreme-court-hobby-lobby-decision-wasserman/	On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain companies with religious objections can opt out of a mandate under the Affordable Care Act to provide free contraception to their employees. The 5-4 ruling involved a case brought by two companies owned by Christian families: Hobby Lobby, a chain of hobby stores, and Conestoga Wood Specialties, which makes wood cabinets. The companies opposed providing certain types of contraception that they believe is equivalent to inducing abortion, including morning-after pills and IUDs. (They didn’t oppose other methods of birth control.) They based their case on the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed by President Bill Clinton. The issue arose because birth control is included among the free preventative services mandated by President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 health care law. Houses of worship and religious institutions were already exempt from this aspect of the law. The court’s ruling applies to "closed corporations" which are in control by a few people, rather than public companies with many shareholders. Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, stating that women who work for these corporations can still access these types of birth control either by the federal government paying for it or through a third-party administrator. Though the ruling was narrower in scope than it could have been, supporters of broad access to contraception expressed disappointment. One of these supporters was U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair from South Florida. In a statement attacking the decision, Wasserman Schultz said that contraception for women isn’t just about avoiding pregnancy. "Nearly 60 percent of women who use birth control do so for more than just family planning," she said. We wondered whether that was correct. Guttmacher Institute study A DNC spokeswoman said Wasserman Schultz was referring to a November 2011 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies reproductive rights. The report focused specifically on the oral birth control pill, not all contraception. (We should note that the Guttmacher institute filed a brief on the side of the federal government in the Supreme Court case. We will also note that the oral birth control pill is different from the morning-after pill the plaintiffs objected to funding.) The Guttmacher report stated that while birth control pills are primarily intended to prevent pregnancy, they also provide other health-related benefits including easing menstrual-related problems. The report used national data from the 2006–2008 National Survey of Family Growth, which is administered by the government’s National Center for Health Statistics. Here are some of the key findings: • Out of about 7,350 women surveyed, 58 percent of pill users relied on the method at least in part for one non-contraceptive reason, such as managing menstrual pain, regulating periods and controlling acne. That’s the source for Wasserman Schultz’s claim about "nearly 60 percent." • Birth control is the most common reason women use the pill, reported by 86 percent of pill users at the time. That left 14 percent of pill users who said they only took the pill for non-contraceptive reasons. • Reliance on the pills for non-contraceptive reasons is highest for teenagers. A spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute told PolitiFact that they had not updated their 2011 report. Previously, we fact-checked a similar claim based on the same report. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said on MSNBC in March that "it’s important to note that women take birth control, more than half of them, as a medication for other conditions, so it is an attack on women." We rated that claim Half True because it required additional clarification about the type of birth control and the survey results. Wasserman Schultz's statement was somewhat more carefully worded. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that "nearly 60 percent of women who use birth control do so for more than just family planning." This claim gets support from a Guttmacher Institute report that found 58 percent of pill users citing at least one non-contraceptive reason. However, Wasserman Schultz’s comment glosses over two important caveats. First, she said "women who use birth control," even though the study looked at women who use the birth control pill specifically -- a type of birth control that wasn’t even one of the ones directly at issue in the Supreme Court case. Second, the Guttmacher study found that birth control is indeed the most common reason that women use the pill, with 86 percent saying it was one of the reasons they chose that option. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2014-06-30T17:12:03	2014-06-30	['None']

pomt-00999	The children coming across the southern U.S. border "were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/05/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-blames-measles-outbreak-immigrant-childre/	Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh says the focus on vaccinations in the wake of the measles outbreak is a "leftist Democratic trick" to divert attention from the president’s "DOA" budget plan. And to the extent that the measles outbreak is real, Limbaugh said Feb. 3, 2015, it was all the fault of the White House anyway. "We have a vaccination problem for one reason: Barack Hussein Obama and his open borders immigration policy, which opened the southern borders to children sick, healthy, you name it, poor, ill-educated, just tens of thousands of kids flooded the southern border all of last year. "They were never examined before they got here. They were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles." Other conservative voices have linked measles to illegal immigrants. The conservative website The Blaze wrote about Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who said the disease was brought into the country by "illegal aliens." The common thread in these statements is the idea that these children were never examined, that they had measles, and Washington took no precautions before allowing them to stay. None of that holds up, however. In fiscal year 2014, over 68,000 unaccompanied minors presented themselves at the border. The crisis spurred a flurry of activity, largely by two government agencies, the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Homeland Security set up new processing centers and HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement looked after the children until their fates were resolved. Contrary to Limbaugh’s assertion, the federal government did examine these kids. The protocol, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, was to provide "vaccinations to all children who do not have documentation of previous valid doses of vaccine." Limbaugh also claimed that these children were never quarantined if they had a disease. The reverse is true. "Children receive additional, more thorough medical screening and vaccinations at ORR shelter facilities," according to the refugee resettlement Web page. "If children are found to have certain communicable diseases, they are separated from other children and treated as needed." Latin America outdoes the United States Further undermining Limbaugh’s case (we reached out to his show and did not hear back) are the vaccination rates for the key countries involved in the influx of unaccompanied minors -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. The latest data from the World Health Organization runs through 2013. As this table shows, over the past four years, the vaccination rates among those countries are on par or exceed the rate in the United States. Country Measles, mumps, rubella vaccination rate: 4-year average El Salvador 92 percent Guatemala 90 percent Honduras 94 percent Mexico 95 percent United States 92 percent With vaccination rates this high, epidemiologists say there is no particular reason to point to children from these countries as the source of a measles outbreak. What we know about the outbreak As a final point, the information on the measles cases this year reported to health departments fails to suggest a link to immigrant children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that most of the 102 cases stem from exposures at Disneyland in California. California health officials report that 59 cases emerged directly or indirectly from the amusement park. The core group was made up of 40 people who worked at or visited the park. Neither the CDC nor the California Department of Health have traced the outbreak to one of the young people who entered the country last year. In fact, assistant surgeon general Anne Schuchat said in a news conference that "we assume that someone got infected overseas, visited the parks and spread the disease to others." Past measles outbreaks have not been linked to Central America. Last year, Ohio saw 382 measles cases. According to state health officials, that began when unvaccinated travelers came back from the Philippines and spread the disease within the local Amish community. The CDC said nearly 80 percent of the cases that year were among people who chose not to be vaccinated due to their religious beliefs. Our ruling Limbaugh pinned the current measles outbreak on the Central American children who flooded the southern border in 2014. Limbaugh said they were never examined and that many had measles. Limbaugh provided no evidence that this is true. Probably, because no evidence exists. The children who came in from Central America were examined and vaccinated as part of a standard routine. There is no data that links this or any other outbreak of measles to those immigrants, who are vaccinated at about the same rate as Americans. This claim lacks any basis in fact.

A Facebook post featuring an image of three naked women photographed from behind suggests the latter. The women are wearing sun hats and shoes, and two have megaphones slung over their shoulders. But they’re not blockwalking—they’re facing what appear to be police and riot officers, who are standing on the other side of some makeshift fencing. "Democrats campaigning!" the Nov. 3 posts says. The next line is followed by an emoji vomiting: "Showing a brilliant statement to gain your vote." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A reverse Google image search quickly shows that the photo is more than a decade old. Photographer Juan Barreto took it for Agence France-Presse on May 16, 2005. The naked women were part of a protest over land rights, and Barreto captured them at the entrance of the presidential residence in Mexico City. In Vermont, a group of women did recently take their clothes off in hopes of boosting voter participation there and elsewhere in the country. Ten women "stripped, held ballots in strategic positions, and let a photographer snap their images in an attempt to convince people to vote on Tuesday," Minnesota Public Radio reported. On Oct. 30, the group posted a mission statement to a Facebook page called Grab Them By The Ballot, named for the get-out-the-vote campaign. It touches on progressive causes and concerns, but doesn’t mention Democrats. "With the #MeToo and #Wetoo movements and recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh there is much at stake in the upcoming elections," the mission statement says. "This group of courageous Vermont women came together in a vulnerable artistic expression to protect al women’s right to choose regarding their body, health, reproductive rights and sexual expression. We joined hands as an outcry against the collective sexual and emotional abuse and trauma endemic in our society. And to champion the rights of marginalized women including transgender people, women of color and physically ‘disabled’ women." Publications including Fox News, the Daily Mail, and The Sun reported that the group was seeking votes for Democrats. Our ruling While there is a campaign featuring nude women supporting historically liberal causes, the Facebook claimed that the three women in the photograph were Democrats campaigning. They were activists protesting in Mexico City, and it wasn’t a get-out-the-vote campaign. We rate this claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-11-06T12:44:14	2018-11-03	['None']
pomt-13700	"Our economy is so much stronger than when (Barack Obama and Joe Biden) took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-half-true-claim-about-job-recovery/	During her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton praised President Barack Obama’s efforts to steer the nation’s recovery from the Great Recession. "Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes," she told the crowd in Philadelphia. "Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. Now, that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot." Here we’ll look at the employment claim -- "nearly 15 million new jobs." Is that correct? Actually, to get that number, Clinton fuzzes the time frame. To do it, she picked the low point of the job market under Obama. From that point, the United States has gained nearly 15 million private-sector jobs. Specifically, the number of employed Americans bottomed out in February 2010 with 107.3 million jobs and rebounded, as of June 2016, to just over 122 million jobs. That’s an increase of about 14.8 million jobs -- a reasonable approximation for Clinton’s phrasing of "nearly 15 million." But note the time frame for that calculation. It doesn’t start at the point "when they" -- Obama and Biden -- "took office." February 2010 was just over a year after Obama and Biden were sworn in. Essentially, Obama and Biden took office as the recession was spiraling to its low point, but it took a while to hit bottom. So after they were sworn in, the number of jobs continued to fall for a year as they worked to stop the economic freefall. We should note that starting the count in February 2010 is something economists have told us is actually a reasonable decision, since the recession began under George W. Bush and Obama can’t reasonably be blamed for job losses in the earliest part of his tenure, when the die was already cast. However, Clinton glossed over the difference in the time frame by starting the count at their inauguration. And how big a difference does this make? It’s not trivial. Using this measurement, the number of jobs rose from about 111.5 million in January 2009 to 122.1 million in June 2016. That’s an increase of 10.6 million jobs, or only about two-thirds of the nearly 15 million total Clinton touted in her speech. We should also note that Clinton chose to use private-sector jobs as the benchmark. That boosts the numbers a bit compared to total jobs because widespread budget-cutting in states and localities has led to a smaller government workforce. If she had cited total employment gains rather than private-sector gains, the increases would have been a little lower -- an increase of 10.1 million jobs (from the start of Obama’s term) or 14.4 million jobs (from the low point in February 2010). Finally, we’ll note, as we regularly do, that no elected official deserves full credit (or blame) for economic results on their watch. Policies pursued by a president can help the economy, but other factors beyond the reach of a president -- from technological change to improvements in the global economy -- also play a role. Our ruling Clinton said, "Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs." Clinton specified "when they took office" in her speech, and the actual number of jobs starting with their inauguration is only about two-thirds as big -- 10.6 million jobs.

pomt-14083	"Closing our state’s wage gap would make a $9 billion difference to Missouri women."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2016/may/18/chris-koster/koster-might-oversimplify-size-gender-wage-gap-rea/	As the Missouri legislative session winds down, Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster isn’t shying away from criticizing the Republican-controlled legislature. Koster tweeted, "The #WageGap isn’t about isn’t about a few cents — it can mean EVERYTHING to a working woman trying to provide for her family." His tweet contained a photo with a captain that stated, "Closing our state’s wage gap would make a $9 billion difference to Missouri women." We decided to look into the claim. Koster’s tweet cited the National Partnership for Women and Families as a source. His campaign also referred us to a St. Louis Business Journal article and a National Women’s Law Center report. National Partnership for Women and Families report The National Partnership for Women and Families said in a September 2015 report that Missouri women who work full time make on average $10,300 less than Missouri men. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 926,000 women working full time and year-round in Missouri. Multiply that by $10,300 and you get more than $9.5 billion. The challenge of comparing incomes Some researchers believe that simply comparing median earnings of male and female workers doesn’t provide a complete picture. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows some of the wage gap comes down to women and men doing different work and having different career paths. Nevertheless, even after considering these factors, a gap still exists. "Economic research shows that, even after controlling for work experience, family division of labor and compensating wage differentials for dangerous jobs, there is still an unexplained gender wage gap," said George-Levi Gayle, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. A study from the Institute for the Study of Labor, an economic research institute based in Bonn, Germany, shows the unexplained wage gap in the United States falls somewhere between 8 percent and 18 percent of the total earnings difference, if the figures are adjusted for additional factors. Using the high-end estimate, the $9.5 billion figure falls to about $1.7 billion. Gayle said gender stereotypes and bias can explain the remaining disparities. According to Gayle, this inequality may exist even when people are rational and non-prejudiced. Our Ruling Koster said closing Missouri’s wage gap could make a $9 billion difference to Missouri women. There is a wage gap. The latest government numbers show that for men and women working full time year-round in Missouri, the gap is more than $9.5 billion. Some, but far from all, of the gap is due to bias and discrimination. Economic studies show the wage gap shrinks when you control for factors such as differences in the jobs men and women do and length of time in the workforce. The bias related portion of the gap could be as much as $1.7 billion. That’s a lot of money, but it isn’t the $9 billion Koster claimed. When we’ve rated such claims before, statements that speak broadly about a wage gap, regardless of the underlying factors, get some benefit of the doubt. Koster’s claim greatly oversimplifies a very complex situation, but the size of the gap is real.

pomt-08703	Georgia's U.S. senators voted for legislation that would "gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/07/stephen-kretzmann/senators-side-big-oil-critic-says/	Are Georgia's two U.S. senators too beholden to "Big Oil" companies? That's the claim on a website created by Oil Change International, critical about the positions of some U.S. senators on some oil and energy issues. The site, www.bobbinginpetroleum.org, has images of 46 senators, including Georgia's Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. Make no mistake, Oil Change International has an agenda. It identifies itself on its website as "a research and advocacy organization that exists to force progress in the energy industry towards an environmentally and socially sustainable energy future." The website also proclaims that the tax-exempt organization "campaigns to expose the true costs of oil and facilitate the coming transition towards clean energy. We are dedicated to identifying and overcoming political barriers to that transition." The website says Chambliss and Isakson have accepted a combined $331,000 in what it dubbed "dirty energy contributions." The largest contributor, about $128,000, was Atlanta-based Southern Co. For visual effect, the heads and torsos of the two senators are floating in rubber duckies in oil-stained water. An oil barrel is in the background. AJC PolitiFact Georgia certainly could not ignore an opportunity to dive deeper into this website. We also wanted to know if Chambliss and Isakson voted for legislation that "gut clear air protections and increase oil dependence." We reached out to the offices of both senators to see if they disputed the claims against their bosses. Both defended their votes in favor of legislation the website criticized. Isakson's Senate seat is up for re-election on Nov. 2. We decided to dig deeper into the claim about the resolution, since the staff of both senators seemed to have a larger beef with that. The legislation in question was written by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. It aimed to prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from formulating regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The first of the new regulations could take effect in 2011. Murkowski argued Congress needs more input in the process, but her bill failed by a 53 to 47 vote. If Murkowski's resolution had been approved, some activists argued it would have a negative impact on clean air regulations. Bobbing in Petroleum called the legislation the "Big Oil Bailout." Chambliss and Isakson argued in support of the legislation largely on economic grounds. The legislation was a skirmish in the ongoing battle in Washington over efforts to pass sweeping energy legislation. The House passed a bill last year to establish a cap on carbon emissions, but the legislation has run into firm opposition in the Senate. Many Republican leaders say the so-called "cap and trade" legislation would become a job-killing tax. Pass the legislation, they argue, and you put Americans out of work. "This backdoor attempt to regulate greenhouse gases will have dramatic negative effects on our manufacturing sector while also causing significant increases in the cost of power generation," Isakson said in a statement after the June 10 vote. Chambliss said in a speech on the Senate floor that day that the EPA's actions would require more cash-strapped farmers to get federal Clean Air Act permits, hurting many of them financially. So would the Murkowski bill "gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence"? First, we must go back to 2007. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that the EPA must consider putting controls on carbon dioxide and other gases in automobile exhaust. The majority rejected arguments by the administration of then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, that the Clean Air Act does not treat carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases as "pollutants," and thus does not give the EPA the authority to regulate them. In September 2009, the EPA, under the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, announced plans to require better gas mileage for cars and trucks and the first-ever rules on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson wants to establish a greenhouse gas emission for cars and light trucks in model years 2012 to 2016. Murkowski introduced her legislation in January to stop the EPA effort. Stephen Kretzmann, who created the Bobbing in Petroleum site, said the EPA regulations would reduce automotive oil consumption by more than 1.8 billion barrels, citing comments Jackson made in a statement to a House of Representatives energy subcommittee. "Eliminating the EPA standard would forfeit ... one-third of its greenhouse gas emissions reductions," Jackson said. Kretzmann also noted a letter by former EPA Administrator Russell Train urging the Senate to vote down the Murkowski bill. Train said the legislation would roll back Clean Air Act protections. "If Congress had removed EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases, industry would have been on more solid ground to challenge them in the future. And I have no doubt that they will, if given the chance," said Kretzmann, who said he's worked on energy and oil issues for nearly two decades. Jonas Monast, who has expertise in federal climate protection policies, agreed Murkowski's legislation would adversely impact the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. However, he said it would not impact U.S. Department of Transportation's ability to increase vehicle efficiency, a point that's been made by other nonpartisan observers. Cars, buses and trucks account for about half of all cancers attributed to outdoor sources of air toxins, federal officials say. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are working on a new rating system that rates the overall fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of different vehicles to help consumers before buying a new car, SUV, truck or van. Would the bill increase oil dependence? "I don't think it's possible to predict at this point," said Monast, senior policy counsel at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Studies at Duke University. Obama announced in May a plan to impose mileage and pollution limits on vehicles, particularly SUVs and trucks. Obama used the BP oil spill to highlight the need to rely less on fossil fuels. The EPA argued Murkowski's resolution would hurt the president's plan and continue America's dependence on foreign oil. Murkowski argued her resolution would not impact the federal Department of Transportation's ability to regulate fuel efficiency. Every expert we talked to said the Murkowski legislation would hurt the EPA's efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. But the experts also said it would not impact federal transportation officials from moving forward with efforts to increase vehicle efficiency. Whether or not the bill would increase oil dependence is still debatable. We rate the statement on the website as Half True.

pomt-11818	"There are ‘sore loser’ laws that would bar Luther Strange from pursuing a seat" because he already lost the Alabama Republican Senate runoff to Roy Moore.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/14/amanda-carpenter/given-roy-moores-troubles-could-luther-strange-run/	With Republican Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore reeling from allegations of sexual improprieties with teenaged girls in the late 1970s, political observers are chasing down all the angles for what could happen in the Dec. 12 special election. One key question is this: Could Luther Strange, the appointed senator who lost to Moore in the Republican runoff earlier this year, still seek the Senate seat? "I think Luther Strange would be a strong candidate for a write-in," Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on Meet the Press. "But a write-in is very difficult, let's face it." This possibility also came up during a segment of CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper. There, conservative pundit Amanda Carpenter said the task may be more than just difficult. "There are ‘sore loser’ laws that would bar Luther Strange from pursuing a seat, having already lost the primary," said Carpenter, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In a tweet sent after her appearance on CNN, Carpenter said the state does have a sore loser law but asked her followers, "Can someone definitively say whether that allows a primary loser to run a write-in campaign?" She later tweeted, "I understand Strange could not appear as a printed choice on ballot but a deliberate write-in campaign seems subject to challenge." (Carpenter did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com With a sitting U.S. senator pushing the idea of a Strange write-in campaign, we at least wanted to see if it is possible, or if Strange is barred from pursuing the seat in any way. The answer is there is an opening for Strange, legally. We’ll walk you through how, and the other electoral machinations that are possible. Could Strange (or anyone else) simply replace Moore on the ballot, or get a different ballot line? No. According to Alabama Code 17-6-21(c) any withdrawal must occur at least 76 days before Election Day. By now, it’s too late to print new ballots, and several hundred ballots listing Moore have already been cast, officials say. Would Strange be barred from running due to a "sore loser" law? No. He would be fine as long as he runs as a write-in candidate. Alabama does have a "sore loser" law that prevents primary losers from making a second run in the same election as an independent. However, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill has told several news outlets that the law applies only to names printed on the ballot -- a scenario that is now moot because the ballot text is already set. Merrill made clear in those interviews -- and experts agree -- that the sore-loser law would not prevent Strange from running as a write-in candidate. "There are no existing stipulations that prohibit a candidate from being elected despite having unsuccessfully run for a party’s nomination, which would normally apply due to Alabama’s sore loser law," the Alabama secretary of state said in a statement. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What happens if Moore voluntarily quits the race? Moore’s name would remain on the ballot, but votes cast for him would not count. (This would also be the case if the state Republican Party officially disowned Moore’s candidacy, something they have not done as of this writing.) If Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or any write-in candidate were to receive the most votes of any candidate -- including Moore -- they would be the winner. If Moore gets the most votes, however, the situation gets murkier. Merrill told Fox News that under that scenario, the election would be declared "null and void," and the governor, Republican Kay Ivey, would schedule a new special election, starting the whole process again. However, "I am not sure that's accurate under state law," said Derek T. Muller, a Pepperdine University law professor who has written about the Alabama scenario. Muller has written that there are two approaches that have generally been taken in situations like this. One is known as the "American rule." Under that system, the votes for any deceased, withdrawn, or ineligible candidate would not be counted, and the election would be declared null and void. The other is known as the "English rule." Under this system, the ineligible candidate would also not have their votes counted, but in this case, the second-place finisher would win. Muller’s research found that Alabama has previously used the American rule, but in 2014, the legislature unanimously passed HB 62, which added language about withdrawn candidates, saying that the canvassing board "may not certify any votes for the candidate." To Muller, "that means that candidate cannot receive the most votes. And that means the ‘American rule’ is not at play." In other words, if Muller’s interpretation is correct, Jones would win even if Moore secured the most votes after withdrawing or being disowned by the party. That conflicts with what Merrill had said on Fox News. We did not hear back from the secretary of state’s office to clarify this point. For the record, Strange said on Nov. 13 that it was "highly unlikely" that he would run for the seat in the wake of the revelations about Moore. And on Nov. 14, Moore sent a tweet that didn’t sound like a candidate looking to leave the race. "Alabamians will not be fooled by this #InsideHitJob. Mitch McConnell's days as Majority Leader are coming to an end very soon. The fight has just begun," he tweeted. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Carpenter said, "There are ‘sore loser’ laws that would bar Luther Strange from pursuing a seat," because he lost the primary to Moore. Alabama does have a "sore loser" law that prevents primary losers from making a second run in the same election as an independent or with another party. But the consensus is that this law applies only to names printed on the ballot -- a scenario that is now moot because the ballot text is already set. Carpenter said as much in a subsequent tweet but added that a write-in candidacy could face legal challenges. Winning a write-in campaign faces long odds, but the bottom line is that Strange could make the attempt if he wishes. We rate Carpenter's statement False.

pomt-13672	"It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Humayun Khan’s) life."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/03/katrina-pierson/trump-spoxs-absurd-claim-clinton-obama-are-respons/	As Donald Trump attacked the family of a Muslim soldier killed in the Iraq war, his spokeswoman blamed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for Capt. Humayun Khan’s 2004 death. It all began when Khizr Khan, Humayun’s father, seared Trump in an emotional speech at the Democratic National Convention. Trump responded by criticizing Khizr’s wife, Ghazala (who responded in the Washington Post) and crying foul over Khizr’s "vicious attacks." This earned him the censure of just about everyone. But all this criticism is misdirected, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said Aug. 2 on CNN: "It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Khan’s) life." Given that Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton secretary of state, we were perplexed by this statement, so we reached out to Pierson. Pierson told us her point was Clinton voted for the war in Iraq in 2002 and "decided not to provide support" and that Obama continued George W. Bush’s rules of engagement policy and "further restricted engagement in Afghanistan." Trump (who, in at least one interview, also supported the invasion) had nothing to do with either decision, Pierson said. Pierson reiterated those points in an Aug. 3, interview with CNN. "Apologize for the timeline. What I was talking about is the fact that Donald Trump has no connection to anything having to do with Capt. Khan, who was a brave war hero. The timeline is very simple and true ... Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq. She did not support the surge. Barack Obama made things worse by invading more countries than President Bush did" Pierson is well within her rights to critique Clinton’s voting record and Obama’s defense policies. But in her original CNN interview, she went further and said Obama and Clinton changed the rules of engagement that "probably cost" Khan’s life. That’s nonsensical. Even if we put the anachronism aside, experts told us restrictive rules of engagement — military directives that regulate the use of force in armed conflict — were not an issue in Khan’s death. Lt. Col. David G. Bolgiano is a retired military officer who served with Special Operations Forces and the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq and Afghanistan and currently practices military and security law in Washington. He told us the rules of engagement, which really haven’t changed since the Reagan years, give all troops the right to use deadly force to defend themselves. Though the Obama administration has been criticized for directives that seek to limit civilian deaths, that right still applies today. And that was the case in 2004, when Capt. Khan died in a suicide bombing at age 27. On June 8, 2004, a taxi packed with explosives drove into the gate of his compound in Baqubah, Iraq, while he was inspecting soldiers on guard duty. According to his commanding officer, Khan ordered his man to "hit the ground" as he approached the vehicle and motioned for it to stop. The bomb then exploded, killing Khan as well as the two suicide bombers and two Iraqi civilians. "Capt. Khan had all the authority in the world to use deadly force" under the rules of engagement, said Bolgiano, who was serving in Iraq in 2004. He added that Khan’s actions were a testament to his bravery and selflessness. "The officer makes a judgement call," said Anthony Cordesman, a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has advised General Stanley McChrystal. "They are very difficult calls to make. But the officer did what a good officer should do, he took the risk and made a command decision." Khan was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. Experts warned that politicization of the rules of engagement were not appropriate and potentially dangerous. "I can’t think of anything worse than somehow getting into a tactical situation where you’re going to have to deal with concerns in the field over campaign rhetoric," Cordesman said. Our ruling Pierson said, "It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Khan’s) life." First, Pierson’s point about rules of engagement is inaccurate and irrelevant. Under the rules of engagement in 2004 and today, Khan would have been able to use deadly force to defend himself. More importantly, Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton his secretary of state.

pomt-03063	In a "sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/01/jeb-hensarling/gop-rep-jeb-hensarling-assails-sweetheart-deal-law/	In the wee hours of the morning of Oct. 1, 2013, as the House was engaged in a futile ping-pong match over averting the federal government shutdown, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, took to the floor to decry a "sweetheart deal" on health insurance for members of Congress. "Mr. Speaker," Hensarling said, "we are debating should members of Congress get a better deal than every other American in Obamacare? House Republicans say, ‘No, that’s not fair. That’s not equal protection under the law.’ Yet, our friends on the other side of the aisle (Democrats) are now saying, ‘No, no, no.’ They’re going to protect this sweetheart deal. ... "Now members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. Is this fair, Mr. Speaker? I think not. Clearly, the other side of the aisle wants to preserve this special deal for Members of Congress granted by the President of the United States." Hensarling was referring to a provision of President Barack Obama’s health care law that was originally intended as a political maneuver by critics of the law. We asked his office for evidence to support his statement, but we didn't hear back. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring that lawmakers and their staffers obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for Congress. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. The problem arose in the drafting of the law. For most Americans who have employer-based insurance, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance. But the version of the health care bill signed into law doesn’t include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges, now called marketplaces. (Here’s a rundown of how this drafting error occurred.) Without a fix, congressional employees would have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. To fix this problem, the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources office, issued a ruling that allowed the same money that would have been spent on the employer’s old health insurance to instead be spent on whatever they purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces. Obamacare critics have portrayed this as a special exemption to protect politically connected lawmakers and staff, one that was unavailable to the public at large. So some lawmakers backed an effort by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to revoke the employer’s premium cost-sharing for members of Congress, aides and other political appointees. As the House and Senate debated how to proceed to end the shutdown, passage of a funding bill with the Vitter Amendment attached was floated as a possibility. So that’s the background. Getting back to Hensarling’s statement, we see four claims embedded in it: Will members of Congress be "the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges"? Hardly -- the tax credits commonly known as subsidies under Obamacare were being put into place starting Oct. 1, the same day the shutdown began. Anyone within a specified income range who purchases insurance on the Obamacare marketplace will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2017, about 24 million Americans will be buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces, many of them with federal subsidies. Only time will tell how many Americans eventually sign up, but it’s almost certainly going to be more than the roughly 30,000 people who work in the legislative branch. Will Members of Congress even get "subsidies"? Not really. All lawmakers and many staffers won’t qualify for the subsidies we discussed above because their income is too high. Instead, what lawmakers and staff will qualify for is better described as employer cost-sharing -- an allotment of money that works exactly the same way as it does for the majority of Americans who get employer-based health care, and that long predated the beginning of the Obamacare exchanges. For Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance, the employer pays a share of the premiums. In this case, that "employer" is the federal government. Is this a "sweetheart deal"? Quite the opposite. Under the law as enacted, lawmakers and congressional aides are actually treated more harshly than any other American. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who have insurance will remain on their existing plans and see few if any disruptions. The marketplaces were created for Americans who lacked insurance entirely or had to buy insurance on their own, without employer assistance. By contrast, the law revokes the longstanding congressional health insurance arrangement and forces them into a new system, something not done for any other class of employee. Even the National Review, the conservative magazine that is none too fond of Obamacare, recently wrote that the provision treats lawmakers and staff "particularly badly." The situation "isn’t a ‘special handout’ for congressional employees. … People who happen to be paid by the federal treasury don’t deserve to have the entire value of their existing coverage stripped away, as almost no Americans will experience." An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. In short, the ability for congressional employees to keep their employer cost-share merely returns them to the already harsh provision that severs them from their existing health care plan. All the fix does is stop that provision from making even more trouble by forcing them to pay thousands of dollars more. We don’t think this qualifies as a "sweetheart deal." Is this "thanks to the Obama administration"? The Obama administration isn’t entirely blameless -- in the rush to sign Obamacare into law, the president overlooked or ignored the problem looming in the legislative language, and his administration did approve the "fix." Still, this controversy has been kept alive largely by Republicans, from the original Republican proposal to the Vitter amendment. So it’s at best a stretch to blame Obama. Our ruling Hensarling said that in a "sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges." This statement is wrong in almost every regard. Millions of ordinary Americans who currently lack health coverage are expected to get Obamacare subsidies in the years ahead. Congressional employees who purchase insurance on the marketplaces won’t be getting subsidies so much as they will be benefiting from a traditional employer cost-share, as many other Americans do. Far from getting a "sweetheart deal," congressional employees would otherwise find themselves forced off their existing insurance plan, something the law itself does to no other employment group. And the issue has been largely driven by Republicans, not by the Obama administration. That’s a lot to get wrong in the space of a sentence or two. We rate Hensarling’s comment Pants on Fire.

pomt-13090	"The Declaration of Independence was written on paper made out of hemp."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/07/kai-degner/kai-degners-falsely-says-declaration-independence-/	The substance of The Declaration of Independence can get you into trouble if Kai Degner, a Democratic congressional candidate, has it right. "The Declaration of Independence was written on paper made out of hemp," he said during an Oct. 17 debate with Republican Bob Goodlatte, the longtime incumbent in Virginia’s 6th congressional district. Holy smokes! We wondered if Degner was right. Hemp comes cannabis plants like marijuana, but it doesn’t contain the same level of tetrahydrocannabinol - THC, for short - that gets people high. Degner said keeping cannabis on a federal list of prohibited drugs is stifling an opportunity for farmers wanting to grow hemp that can be used to make clothes, rope, twine and other stuff. Thirty-one states, including Virginia, have passed laws to allow hemp cultivation for commercial or research purposes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But federal regulations limit who can cultivate it. In Virginia, farmers may only grow it to sell to universities for research examining issues like how it fares in the state’s climate and hemp’s economic viability, said Elaine Lidholm, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. This brings us back to The Declaration of Independence, one of Virginia’s most acclaimed products. Rampant rumors that the actual document - the one on display at the National Archives - was written on hemp paper are untrue. Officials at Monticello - the home of Thomas Jefferson, the main author of the Declaration - say the document was penned on parchment, which is made from animal skin. "A number of sites on the Internet claim that the Declaration of Independence was written on paper made from hemp. As far as we know, this is not true," Monticello says on its website. Degner told us he misspoke; what he’d heard was that the founding document was drafted on hemp paper. He sent us a couple of sources from pro-hemp organizations making that qualified claim. Degner referred us to Chase Milner, the Shenandoah Valley regional director of the Virginia Industrial Hemp Coalition. Milner sent us a copy of a 2010 book by Jack Herer, whom he said was "kind of the godfather of the hemp reform movement." Herer, now deceased, wrote this passage in his book: "The first draft of the Declaration of Independence (June 28, 1776) was written on Dutch (hemp) paper, as was the second draft completed on July 2, 1776. This was the document actually agreed to on that day and announced and released on July 4, 1776. On July 19, 1776, Congress ordered the Declaration be copied and engrossed on parchment (a prepared animal skin) and this was the document actually signed by the delegates on August 2, 1776." There are no footnotes in Herer’s book or any other indication about where the information for that passage came from. But there’s reason to be skeptical of the qualified claim the Declaration was drafted on hemp. Monticello says that analysis of Jefferson’s original draft, kept at the Library of Congress, was most likely written on Dutch paper. "While hemp was commonly used to make paper in Southern Europe during this time, the Dutch were much more likely to use flax or linen rags," Monticello says. For more insight, we reached out to The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University initiative that has been been compiling and publishing volumes of Jefferson’s writings for decades. "We concur with the information on the Monticello website, that the paper for the drafts of the Declaration would have most likely derived from linen rags, with the primary component being flax, not hemp," W. Bland Whitley, the associate editor of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, wrote us in an email. Whitley added that Julian Boyd, the founding editor of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, found that watermarks on the paper used for various drafts indicated they came from Holland. Whitley also pointed us to a 2012 University of Iowa article about early European papermaking technology. Whitley said the takeaway from the article is that centuries ago, coarse rags and roping made from hemp mostly would have been used to make wrapping paper, rather than writing paper. The article notes early European paper-making methods from the 14th to 19th centuries included mixing hemp and flax together to make paper. So Whitley added he couldn’t completely dismiss the possibility that some hemp was used to make the paper bearing the draft Declaration. "In short, we can’t totally rule out that some small amount of hemp went into the manufacture of the rags that produced the paper Jefferson used for the Declaration but would argue against a definitive statement that it was hemp paper," Whitley wrote. A final note. During the debate, Goodlatte says he opposes legalizing marijuana because he feels it’s a dangerous drug. But he says he’s intrigued by hemp’s value as economic commodity and has supported hemp research. Our ruling Degner said, "The Declaration of Independence was written on paper made out of hemp." He’s wrong; the actual, signed version of the Declaration was written on parchment made of animal skin. Degner told us he meant to say that the early drafts of the Declaration were on hemp paper. But even on this, experts are highly skeptical. We rate Degner’s statement False.	None	Kai Degner	None	None	None	2016-11-07T00:00:00	2016-10-17	['None']

pomt-15038	In 2006, Planned Parenthood performed more prevention services and cancer screenings than abortions, but in 2013, there were more abortions.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/01/jason-chaffetz/chart-shown-planned-parenthood-hearing-misleading-/	Congress may have avoided a government shutdown related to Planned Parenthood funding — at least so far — but the controversy over the women’s health organization looks like it’s here to stay. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sparred with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards during a high-profile hearing on Sept. 29. One of their face-offs originated with a chart Chaffetz flashed, indicating that Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than "life-saving procedures" in 2013, a complete reversal from just seven years ago. The chart features a pair of lines crossing — one headed upward (abortions) and the other headed downward (cancer screening and prevention services). When referring to the chart in the hearing, Chaffetz said, "In pink, that's the reduction in the breast exams, and the red is the increase in the abortions. That's what's going on in your organization." "This is a slide that has never been shown to me before," Richards responded. "Excuse me, my lawyer is informing me that the source of this is actually Americans United for Life, which is an anti-abortion group. So, I would check your source." "Then we will get to the bottom of the truth of that," Chaffetz agreed. Many news outlets characterized the chart as misleading, so we too wanted to get to the bottom of the truth. As it turns out, Richards’ lawyer was correct about the source of the chart -- it comes from an Americans United for Life web post from June 2015. The chart, we found, gives a misleading impression. The numbers listed on the chart are based on actual statistics, but they are small and were hard to read during the televised hearings. The chart’s most prominent feature — the much larger crossed arrows — suggests a conclusion that’s flat wrong. We reached out to Chaffetz’s office but did not hear back. A spokesperson for Americans United for Life told PolitiFact that the graphic is accurate and honest. Experts, however, begged to differ. "That graphic is a damn lie," said Alberto Cairo, who researches visual communication at the University of Miami. "Regardless of whatever people think of this issue, this distortion is ethically wrong." Dueling axes Chaffetz’s chart falls into a category known as a dual-axis chart. On the left side, cancer screenings and prevention services are plotted in the millions. On the right side, abortions are plotted in the hundreds of thousands. But the way the chart was assembled is problematic. For starters, dual-axis charts are particularly susceptible to showing spurious correlations. With two axes, trend lines can be exaggerated and manipulated, as most people ignore the axis labels that put the numbers in context. "It forces your brain to see a relationship that isn’t there," Cairo said. "As economist Gary Smith once said, ‘If you double the axes, you can double the mischief.’ " Second, it’s even more inappropriate to use a dual-axis chart when comparing equivalent measures (in this case, the number of services performed by Planned Parenthood) using different scales, said Enrico Bertini, a professor at New York University who studies data visualization and who called the chart "scandalous." Typically, dual-axis charts are used to compare lines that represent different things — "for instance, abortion rates and cost," said Bertini. "But in this case the unit is the same." "You cannot put two measures, one in the millions and one in the hundreds, without making it explicit," Cairo said. "We map data into visual properties — height, length, color — but we need to keep the proportions. We cannot force the data to adopt a shape we like." Finally, perhaps the most egregious decision was to not label the axes. Experts told us that, given this decision, they cannot rule out purposeful deception. "By claiming to combine these two lines into one graph and then omitting the y-axis, we are being misled into to making a false comparison of two non-equivalent contexts," said Noah Iliinsky, a visualization and information designer based in Seattle. "The graph is absolutely misleading, and intentionally so." Iliinsky also said he saw "propagandized design choices" in the choice of the arrowheads, which suggest a "strong continuation of these trends, which we don’t know to be true." Corrected charts With guidance from the experts, we compiled the number of abortions and cancer screenings/prevention services from Planned Parenthood’s annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (we could not find a report from 2008). Here’s what the chart should look like: As you can see from the chart, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood has essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009. It is true, however, that the organization now provides fewer cancer screenings and preventive services, though medical experts said that’s more likely due to changing health guidelines than the organization prioritizing abortions. Spokespersons for Planned Parenthood and for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both pointed to changing guidelines for Pap smears, the screening test for cervical cancer. Medical groups used to recommend an annual Pap, but now suggests the test every three or five years for most women. Planned Parenthood also provides an array of other services such as STI/STD testing and treatment — services that have gone up by 50 percent since 2006 — as well as pregnancy tests. Here’s how all of the services have changed from 2006 to 2013: < A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood told PolitiFact that the number of services provided in each category tend to fluctuate from year to year for myriad reasons, ranging from changes in laws and medical practices to the opening or closure of Planned Parenthood clinics. Megan Christin, a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, speculated that the decline in contraception could be due to a growth in the use of IUDs, which last for five to eight years. Overall, if we compare abortions and non-abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood — and if we use standard scales on the axes, we see largely consistent trend lines for both: Our ruling At the hearing, Chaffetz presented a chart that showed the number of abortions at Planned Parenthood rising higher than the number of preventive services and cancer screenings between 2006 and 2013. But that’s inaccurate, disputed by the chart’s own, hard to read numerical labels. In fact, there were three times as many cancer screenings and prevention services as abortions in 2013. Experts in data presentation said this was an egregious example of using a chart to mislead. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03319	Says the reasoning behind Portland's high water and sewer rates is "all kinds of ’pet projects’ unrelated to the core function of the water and sewer bureaus"	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/jul/26/portlanders-water-reform/are-pet-projects-blame-portlands-high-water-and-se/	There’s little doubt that Portland has one of the highest combined water and sewer rates in the country. The city came in at No. 5 in a 2010 industry analysis of the nation’s 50 most populous cities, and rates have more than doubled since 2001. Naturally, this leads to some frustration from ratepayers. A couple years back, a group of Portlanders filed a lawsuit asking a Multnomah County judge to declare that the city improperly spent millions of dollars in ratepayer money on projects such as the Rose Festival Foundation headquarters and the Water House in east Portland. Now the man behind that lawsuit, Kent Craford, is launching another effort to tamp down on increases. He’s formed a group called Portlanders for Water Reform, which aims to get a measure on the 2014 ballot with the goal of wresting oversight of water and sewer utilities from the Portland City Council and giving it to an independently elected board. The group explained its motivation in an e-mail looking for donations on the day it launched the campaign: "As you know, Portland water and sewer rates are out of control and sadly they aren’t going to get any better. According to the Portland Water Bureau’s own numbers, water rates will increase 66 percent in the next five years. Portland’s water rates are higher than those in Phoenix, Arizona! This is unacceptable. "What is even more unacceptable is the reasoning behind the high rates. All kinds of ’pet projects’ unrelated to the core function of the water and sewer bureaus has (sic) been funded in the bureaus’ budgets at the direction of the City Council. Ratepayers have sued the City over these expenditures. By the City’s own account, the projects identified in this lawsuit total over $127 million." These are excerpts from a e-mail sent to select donors by a fundraising agency on behalf of Portlanders for Water Reform and then published by the Portland Mercury. Craford wouldn’t give The Oregonian a copy but he did confirm the letter’s authenticity. PolitiFact Oregon couldn’t help wonder whether these pet projects were really the reason for the growing rates. We decided to look into the matter for ourselves. First we spoke with the city attorney’s office to double check that the $127 million cited in the e-mail was accurate. It is. There are two things to keep in mind here, though. That $127 million figure is the high-end estimate. And the bill was wracked up over a time period of between four and 10 years. The figure includes line items like the financing of political campaigns, the Portland Loo Project, the Rose Festival Headquarters (which has since been paid through other funds), the Dodge Park master plan, park arborists and the acquisition of Centennial Mills. Now that all adds up -- and it’s not just the group filing this ballot measure that has been closely watching the spending. So has The Oregonian, both in news articles and editorials. Still, as City Hall reporter Brad Schmidt has been careful to point out in his coverage, these projects are a relative drop in the bucket when shown against overall bureau spending. Together, those bureaus spend about $440 million a year while the millions mentioned in the lawsuit have been dispersed over a number of years, at least as far back as 2008 according the lawsuit itself. That means the "pet projects" spending -- and folks at the city don’t believe everything in the lawsuit is unrelated to the bureaus’ missions -- accounts for about 7 percent of what the water and environmental services spent over the past four years. Now, we also spoke with people from each of the bureaus. David Shaff, the Water Bureau’s administrator, pointed out that the bureau is expecting to spend about $300 million alone on federally mandated reservoir changes. "The Water House or the loo or the Rose Festival headquarters are a tiny fraction of that," Shaff said. Similarly, over at the Bureau of Environmental Services, which takes care of sewers, money is being spent. Take, for instance, the Big Pipe. That project cost the city $1.4 billion and its debt is still being paid off. What’s more, to keep the city’s century-old system in working order, that bureau plans on spending $139 million over the next five years in one repair program alone. We called Craford to get his take on all of this. "It's a one page letter," he said. "They need to be quick, they need to get people's attention and conclude with the request … it's not intended to be a book report." We understand that, of course, but the way the e-mail reads it’s the pet projects that are driving the increasing water and sewer rates. Certainly, ending those projects would help curb the increases, but that wouldn’t end them -- not by a long shot. "Of course these are not the only contributors to rates," Craford said. He then cited $300 million worth of spending on reservoirs he doesn’t believe we need -- though that has been mandated by the federal government -- and "all sorts of projects that are ‘mission related’ that are unnecessary." In a letter looking for donations, Portlanders for Water Reform clearly draws a link between the city’s high water and sewer rates and "all kinds of ‘pet projects’ unrelated to the core function of the bureaus." The e-mail clearly states that those projects are "the reasoning" for the high rates, leaving the impression that they’re the main cause, if not the only one. A closer look reveals they are a relatively small part the rising rates, shadowed by much larger projects. The statement contains some element of truth in that these project contribute to increased rates, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, particularly larger projects like the $1.4 billion Big Pipe. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Portlanders for Water Reform	None	None	None	2013-07-26T12:17:30	2013-07-18	['None']
pomt-08860	"Harry Reid says he does more for Nevada. He's done more for unemployment. We were at 4.4 percent. Now we're at 14 percent. He's done more for the foreclosure rate. We have the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. He's done more for bankruptcy. We have the highest bankruptcy rate in the nation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/05/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-blames-harry-reid-nevada-economic-wo/	Attack ads abound in the lively race between Republican Sharron Angle and Majority Leader Harry Reid for Nevada’s senate seat. Despite Reid’s barrage of heavily-funded attack ads this summer, Angle has held her own in the polls and managed to put out a few zingers herself. Her latest ad responded to Reid’s claims that "No One Can Do More" for Nevada. Speaking on camera to a group of elderly supporters, Angle asserted, "Harry Reid says he does more for Nevada. He's done more for unemployment. We were at 4.4 percent. Now we're at 14 percent. He's done more for the foreclosure rate. We have the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. He's done more for bankruptcy. We have the highest bankruptcy rate in the nation. Harry Reid has done more, and it’s time for us to say stop doing it. We can’t stand any more." We wondered just how bad things had gotten in the Silver State, so we decided to check the facts. Easiest to check was Angle’s claim that Nevada has the highest bankruptcy rate in the nation. Unfortunately for the state, at a per capita bankruptcy rate of 11.7 percent, Nevada is at the top of the charts, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Angle was also correct that Nevada has the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. One Nevadan out of 23 was in foreclosure this year -- a rate of 4.34 percent. Nationally, only 2.7 percent of homeowners were in foreclosure, according to data from RealtyTrac, which monitors foreclosure filings across the nation. The agency did note, however, that Nevada’s filings for the first six months of 2010 decreased by 13 percent compared with the last six months of 2009. Angle was correct that Nevada’s unemployment rate for May 2010 was 14 percent, it’s unclear what time period she’s referring to when she said "We were at 4.4 percent." We did a little digging, and discovered she was referring to January 2007, when Reid became the Senate Majority Leader, and that was, indeed, the unemployment rate. But if she was trying to talk about the effect Reid himself had on Nevada’s unemployment rate, it might have been more accurate to compare today’s unemployment rates with those of 1987 -- when Reid first took office and the rate was 6.1. Instead, she chose to compare one of the lowest unemployment rates during Reid’s tenure to the highest. Although her numbers are on-target, they don’t tell the whole story. For one thing, the state’s foreclosure and bankruptcy rates are beginning to improve. Many experts attribute Nevada’s high unemployment rate to the recession -- not to Reid, since the state’s largest industries have been hurt nationwide by the economic downturn. "Nevada has been hit extremely hard as the recession has spread throughout the economy...Clearly, with its historical reliance on gaming and construction as engines of growth, Nevada has been at the epicenter of the current economic downturn, as these two sectors have each felt the brunt of negative economic forces," said a Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation press release. In any case, it’s up to voters to determine how much impact any one Senator has had on his state’s bankruptcy, foreclosure, and unemployment rates -- even if that Senator is the Majority Leader. Angle has quoted her figures correctly, but there’s more to the story than her ad implies. She cherry-picked numbers for one claim, comparing past unemployment rates in Nevada to the current rate. And she forcefully attributes Nevada’s woes to Reid -- while his responsibility is unclear at best. We’ll rate this one Half True.

pomt-05484	"The (ARC Tunnel) project was originally estimated to be $8.7 billion, and New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/19/jennifer-beck/arc-tunnel-project-overruns-would-have-been-new-je/	Backed by billions of dollars from federal and state sources, the canceled Hudson River rail tunnel project had been praised by supporters for its potential to ease congestion and create thousands of jobs. But had the project exceeded its estimated budget, New Jersey alone would have had to cover the additional bills, state Sen. Jennifer Beck says. About 18 months after Gov. Chris Christie terminated the Access to the Region’s Core project — better known as the ARC project — the proposal returned to the headlines last week with the release of an report on the project’s history. In an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck (R-Monmouth) pointed out how federal officials estimated the cost of the project, which would have linked Secaucus to a new rail station deep under West 34th Street in Manhattan, could climb to between $10 billion and $13 billion. "The project was originally estimated to be $8.7 billion, and New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns," she said. PolitiFact New Jersey discovered Beck is right. Based on a federal rule for such projects, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said. Beck said it didn’t seem equitable that New York officials wouldn’t contribute anything. "It didn’t make sense," Beck told us. "It really is a regional project." Let’s review some of the history behind the ARC project. With NJ Transit as the lead agency, New Jersey was to contribute $2.7 billion toward the $8.7 billion project cost. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was to contribute $3 billion, with the remaining $3 billion coming from a federal transit program. But in their latest estimate before the project was canceled, federal officials said the cost could increase to between about $9.8 billion and roughly $12.4 billion. After Christie first announced plans to cancel the project, federal officials presented a few options to fund the remaining costs, including federal loans and a public-private partnership to secure additional funding. But on Oct. 27, 2010, Christie went ahead with terminating what was the largest planned public works project in the nation, citing potential cost increases and the state’s fiscal climate. Due to the project’s cancellation, there was no final agreement on the responsibility for cost growth, according to a recent investigative report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Still, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion, DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told us. Nisly said in an e-mail that "it is important to note that we were actively working with NJ Transit to mitigate any potential costs when they decided to walk away from the project." According to Nisly, the basis for that responsibility is a 2006 federal rule that includes the following phrase: "Once the project is approved into final design, any increase in project costs will be borne by the sponsoring agency and its non-section 5309 New Starts funding partners." That rule goes on to say that "any cost increase later in project development is the sole responsibility of the project sponsor." Our ruling In an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck claimed that beyond the $8.7 billion budget for the ARC project, "New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns." Based on a federal rule governing such projects, the senator’s claim is accurate. As a DOT spokesman confirmed, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10304	John McCain refuses to support a new bipartisan energy bill "because it would take away tax breaks from oil companies like Exxon Mobil."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/07/barack-obama/mccain-opposes-taxes-but-hasnt-commented-on-bill/	Sen. Barack Obama's campaign says Sen. John McCain is a Washington insider with a special place in his heart for oil companies. "McCain has consistently chosen profits for the oil companies over energy relief for American families," said a recent press released issued by the campaign. McCain even refused to back a new bipartisan energy compromise in the Senate "because it would take away tax breaks from oil companies like Exxon Mobil." Turns out the Obama campaign is off base with its charge that McCain opposes the new measure. A bipartisan group of senators unveiled the proposal on Aug. 1, 2008. Called the New Energy Reform Act of 2008 or New ERA, the measure advocates expanded offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, incentives and research to transition cars to alternative fuels, and a number of conservation and energy efficiency proposals. To pay for the incentives, the act would roll back about $30-billion in tax deductions that oil and gas companies currently receive, among other things. The group of senators supporting the initiative calls itself the "Gang of 10," hearkening back to the "Gang of 14," a group of senators (including McCain) that came together in 2005 to prevent filibusters of federal judicial nominees. As proposed, the Gang of 10's measure includes things that both candidates don't like. Obama has said no to oil drilling, while McCain has opposed additional taxes. The day the proposal was unveiled, Obama said he was willing to consider drilling if the plan included enough other measures for energy independence. "If it is part of an overarching package then I am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem," Obama told the St. Petersburg Times . (We ruled this change of position a Half Flip on the Flip-o-Meter .) Meanwhile, an unnamed spokesman for McCain told the Wall Street Journal that while McCain "applauds the bipartisan effort," he wouldn't support the proposal because "he cannot and will not support legislation that raises taxes." The next week, Obama's campaign announced it would send supporters to Florida gas stations to promote Obama's energy policies and knock McCain's. "Supporters will also highlight Sen. John McCain's failure to do anything to address the energy crisis during his 26 years in Washington," the campaign said in a statement. "McCain has consistently chosen profits for the oil companies over energy relief for American families, including voting against fuel mileage standards, opposing renewable sources of energy, and refusing to back the bipartisan energy compromise in the Senate because it would take away tax breaks from oil companies like Exxon Mobil." We wanted to know if McCain was opposing the bill and if it was because of rescinded tax breaks for oil companies. One unattributed statement in the Wall Street Journal seemed like not much evidence on which to hang such a charge. For all the prepared statements the McCain campaign has put out on energy policy — we've got dozens — we couldn't find one that specifically addressed the new proposal. So we asked Brian Rogers, a campaign spokesman, about it. Rogers said McCain is opposed to tax increases, and would not support legislation that included tax increases. But he also said that the Gang of 10 has yet to present a draft of the legislation, and that McCain "would certainly look at any legislation." "He hasn't taken a position on it, because there's no specific legislation," Rogers said. Rogers also pointed us to an Aug. 6 article from the Shreveport Times in which spokesman Tucker Bounds made similar statements that McCain was essentially uncommitted on the legislation. The Senate is in recess as we reported this statement. But the Gang of 10 hopes to have a proposal finalized when the Senate returns in September, said a spokesman for Sen. Kent Conrad, D-S.D., a member of the group. The other senators include Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga.; John Thune, R-S.D.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.; Mary Landrieu, D-La.; Johnny Isakson, R-Ga.; Bob Corker, R-Tenn.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; and Ben Nelson, D-Neb. It will be interesting to see what happens in September, but for now, the statement from the Obama campaign pushes McCain's position too far. It's true that McCain's campaign said he won't support the legislation if it includes tax increases, but technically speaking, McCain has not taken a position on the new measure and he has not "refused to support it." McCain may well end up opposing this legislation if his antitax sentiment wins out over his desire to expand offshore drilling. But at the time the Obama campaign made its statement, it wasn't an accurate summary of McCain's position. We rule the statement False.

pomt-05203	"When I was U.S. Attorney we wound up putting 10 percent of the state Legislature in jail during my seven years."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/11/chris-christie/chris-christie-said-while-he-was-us-attorney-10-pe/	Gov. Chris Christie identified three ingredients for brewing corruption in state government: districts drawn to favor incumbents, no term limits and entitlement that grows with time. Those are some of the reasons why the Republican governor favors capping the time members of the New Jersey Assembly and Senate can serve, he said Wednesday at a town hall meeting in Piscataway. Without such restraints, corruption may run as rampant in Trenton as Christie claims it was while he was the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. "I think that we should do it for a few reasons, corruption is certainly one of them. As you know when I was U.S. Attorney we wound up putting 10 percent of the state Legislature in jail during my seven years," Christie said, eliciting a round of applause from the audience. Later, he said, "I think the longer people are there the more entitled they become. The more entitled they feel." New Jersey can’t shake its connection with corrupt officials, a link that has been well established over time. But did Christie really put away 10 percent of the state Legislature? By Christie’s count, his office won more than 130 convictions or guilty pleas from both Republicans and Democrats. Many of those came from local officials. Christie nabbed a handful of state senators and assemblymen while he was U.S. Attorney, from 2002 to the end of 2008. But 10 percent of the state Legislature is an overreach. In total, 120 legislators comprise the state Legislature, with 40 in the Senate and 80 in the Assembly. During Christie’s nearly seven years as U.S. Attorney, PolitiFact New Jersey found more than 185 people who served in either chamber. Christie’s office charged five legislators -- all Democrats -- while they were in office: state Sens. Wayne Bryant, Joseph Coniglio and Sharpe James and Assemblymen Mims Hackett and Alfred Steele. All five served jail time. That’s less than 3 percent of all the people who served. The federal investigation of two other state legislators who were jailed, Republican Assemblyman Daniel Van Pelt and Democratic Assemblyman Joseph Vas, began while Christie was U.S. Attorney. However, they were not charged until after Christie left the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Democrat John Lynch, a former state Senate president, was charged and jailed while Christie was U.S. Attorney. But Lynch was no longer in office when he was charged. Even if those individuals are included, the fact remains that Christie didn’t jail 10 percent of the state Legislature during his time as U.S. Attorney. "Really?" Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail. "Every other person in the audience understood the Governor was making a rhetorical point about his extensive record in combating political corruption as U.S. Attorney and not, as you seem to be suggesting, citing, with great exactitude, some baseball statistic." "The Governor was emphasizing, conversationally, the gravity of the corruption which in those years reached into the highest levels of the legislature as well as high-ranking party bosses and operatives, and former legislators across this state – an extensive and politically powerful rogues gallery. Honestly, if you were actually in attendance at the town hall, heard his tone and inflection when he made this remark -- and were around in those years in New Jersey -- you would know that," Drewniak said. Still, the governor can make a point about his record on corruption without saying he put 10 percent of the state Legislature in jail. That’s just not true. Our ruling Christie said when he was U.S. Attorney "we wound up putting 10 percent of the state Legislature in jail during my seven years." As the state’s chief federal law enforcement officer, the governor charged scores of public officials with corruption. Five of those officials were sitting state legislators at the time they were charged. All five were later jailed. That’s not a trivial figure, but it’s not 10 percent of the state Legislature.

pomt-05975	Says Newt Gingrich’s contract was with "the lobbyists at Freddie Mac."	true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-newt-gingrichs-contract-was-fredd/	With the Republican primary battle moving into Florida, Mitt Romney went on the attack against the winner of the South Carolina primary, Newt Gingrich. At a debate in Tampa, Romney criticized Gingrich for advising Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant that backs housing loans around the country. Gingrich has said he was never a lobbyist for Freddie Mac, a statement we’ve rated Half True. Gingrich never had to register as a lobbyist, but it appears he took pains to avoid being subject to the rules. Romney said during the debate that Gingrich’s contract "was provided by the lobbyists at Freddie Mac." We decided to check it out. Gingrich’s consulting group was retained by Freddie Mac in 2006. The Gingrich campaign released a statement in November addressing Gingrich’s work. "To be clear, Speaker Gingrich did no lobbying of any kind, nor did his firm. This was expressly written into the Gingrich Group contracts. Instead, the Gingrich Group was hired to offer strategic advice to Freddie Mac on a number of issues," the statement said. The statement said Gingrich advised Freddie that it was dangerous to buy mortgage-backed securities based on questionable home loans. He also told Freddie on how to lower prescription drug costs for its employees. Finally, Freddie Mac "was interested in advice on how to reach out to more conservatives." On the evening of the Tampa debate, the Gingrich Group released its contract with Freddie Mac for the year 2006. That contract shows that the Gingrich Group’s primary contact within Freddie Mac was Craig Thomas, who is named in the document as Freddie’s director of public policy. Thomas was also a registered lobbyist for Freddie Mac in 2006. The 2006 contract doesn’t appear to cover all the work that the Gingrich Group did for Freddie Mac. Bloomberg News reported that Gingrich received between $1.6 million and $1.8 million in fees from two separate contracts. The number came from unnamed sources, though, so we can’t independently confirm or refute it. The contract released before the debate in Tampa showed Gingrich Group was to be paid $25,000 per month in 2006. To be a registered lobbyist, one has to meet a number of detailed rules laid out in federal law. One of the main rules is that a person has to register if he or she holds two or more meetings with elected officials or staff in any quarter of the year on behalf of a client. Also, lobbying activities must constitute 20 percent or more of the lobbyist’s time during any three-month period. (Want more detail? Read 27 pages of guidance on disclosing lobbying activities via the U.S. Senate website.) Experts we spoke with and the research we reviewed showed the "strategic advice" category is a way of using influence without having to register as a lobbyist. They said strategic advisers can do quite a bit for clients like Freddie Mac without acquiring the lobbyist label. They can stay at the client’s office and give their best advice on with whom to meet and what to say. They can give instructions to someone who is a registered lobbyist, again telling the lobbyist with whom to meet and what points to address. They can take their clients to meetings with groups that aren’t part of the government, such as grassroots political groups. They can even have one big meeting with an elected official to make a case for a client. "There’s a lot of activity that ordinary people would think of as lobbying that doesn’t trigger the obligation to register as a lobbyist under federal law. Strategic advice is one of those kinds of things that doesn’t," said Joseph Sandler, an attorney with the Washington law firm Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb, when we spoke with him in December. Sandler was one of four co-chairs of an American Bar Association task force that recommended changes to federal lobbying laws to improve disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest. One of its recommendations was that people who give strategic advice disclose their work under a new category of "lobbying support." We should also note that people from both parties play this game. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was a "policy adviser" at the lobbying firms Alston & Bird and DLA Piper. He had to answer questions about his work when President Barack Obama selected him to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. (Daschle ended up withdrawing over tax issues connected to another client giving him the use of a car and driver.) "Newt Gingrich is certainly not alone among well-heeled political players who say they just offer consulting services or strategic advice -- without needing to register as lobbyists. But it's a stretch to claim that they aren't part of the influence game," said Michael Beckel, a spokesman with the Center for Responsive Politics, via email. The nonpartisan group monitors lobbying and campaign spending. Our ruling Romney said Newt Gingrich’s contract was with "the lobbyists at Freddie Mac." Gingrich provided strategic advice, a way of wielding political influence without having to register as a lobbyist. The primary point of contact on the contract was one of Freddie’s lobbyists. We rate Romney’s statement True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-24T00:16:27	2012-01-24	['None']
pomt-10345	"Barack Obama said he would debate 'anywhere, anytime' but has rejected joint town hall meetings."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/john-mccain/obama-seems-to-have-change-of-heart/	It comes at the end of a laundry list of alleged flip-flops by Sen. Barack Obama, contained in a news release from Sen. John McCain's campaign. Change #17: "Barack Obama said he would debate 'anywhere, anytime' but has rejected joint town hall meetings." McCain has repeatedly proposed as many as 10 town hall meetings this summer; the Obama campaign countered with a proposal for two joint appearances this summer. Currently in stalemate, the McCain campaign claims Obama reneged on a promise to engage him "anywhere, anytime." And so now, inevitably, we have a debate over debates. The genesis of Obama "anywhere, anytime" comment dates back to a May 16, 2008, speech in Watertown, S.D. "I am happy to have a debate with John McCain and George Bush about foreign policy," Obama said. "If John McCain wants to meet me anywhere, anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in Iraq, Iran, the Middle East or around the world, that is a conversation I'm happy to have, because I believe that there is no separation between John McCain and George Bush when it comes to our Middle East policy, and I think their policy has failed." If it was a sitcom, Obama's "anywhere, anytime" challenge would have been followed by an audience "Oooooh." In a speech on June 4, McCain stepped up and proposed a series of 10 town hall meetings, one a week until the week before the Democratic National Convention (in addition to the three traditional debates after the conventions). "I suggest a town hall meeting format because I believe it's the best way," McCain said. "I don't think we need any big media-run productions, no process questions from reporters, no spin rooms, just two Americans running for the highest office of the greatest nation on Earth responding to the concerns of the people whose trust we must earn." Many speculated that such an intense and unprecedented schedule of town hall meetings would benefit McCain, providing national media exposure to a campaign that is likely to be vastly outspent on television advertising. Obama seemed warm to the idea. On the same day, Obama told ABC, "Oh, we're definitely going to be doing some town hall debates." "I look forward to, you know, having more than just the three traditional debates that we've seen in recent presidential contests," Obama said. But then the Obama campaign countered with a proposal for five joint appearances: the three traditional debates after the conventions, plus a joint town hall on the economy in July and a debate on foreign policy in August. So really just two additional appearances before the regular debates. The McCain campaign declined. Politico reported that the single town hall Obama agreed to would have been on the Fourth of July weekend, a guaranteed ratings loser that McCain spokesman Brian Rogers referred to as a "total joke." McCain campaign manager Rick Davis wrote a letter to the Obama campaign stating, "We fear that our negotiations over joint town hall meetings are turning into a debate about process. That is exactly what we have always hoped to avoid, and why we proposed a town hall format that would render many of these process issues moot. "We remain committed to this idea because joint town hall meetings offer the best format for presenting both candidates' visions for our country's future in a substantive way. We have a chance to change the way presidential elections are run and elevate the political dialogue. Americans deserve this kind of opportunity, and we hope that Sen. Obama will join us at town hall meetings throughout the summer months." Obama campaign manager David Plouffe responded that Obama's proposal for five joint appearances "would have been the most of any presidential campaign in the modern era, offering a broad range of formats and representing an historic commitment to openness and transparency. "It's disappointing that Sen. McCain and his campaign decided to decline this proposal. Apparently they would rather contrive a political issue than foster a genuine discussion about the future of our country." An Obama campaign spokesman said on July 11 that nothing has changed since that stalemate. Clearly there is a lot of posturing going on. But did Obama backtrack? His "anywhere, anytime" challenge was issued specifically "to debate about our respective policies in Iraq, Iran, the Middle East or around the world." The Obama campaign did offer an "in-depth" foreign policy debate in August. And he didn't reject the town hall concept, he just wasn't willing to do as many as McCain wanted. Still, after seemingly endorsing the idea, Obama's offer of just two appearances (one on a holiday weekend) beyond the traditional postconvention debates sounds like a change of heart.

pomt-10111	In 1992, Barack Obama directed "Project Vote - an arm of ACORN that also encouraged voter registration."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/17/john-mccain/project-vote-not-an-arm-of-acorn/	John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee have launched efforts to connect Barack Obama and the community organizing group ACORN. ACORN was founded in 1970; its acronym stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. ACORN's agenda includes left-leaning causes such as voter registration drives for low-income groups, initiatives to increase the minimum wage and programs offering help to victims of predatory lending. By all indications, ACORN operates within the American political mainstream, though clearly it favors the left side of the ideological spectrum. Its voter registration efforts tend to focus on the low-income, minorities and youth, all traditional Democratic constituencies. Obama received an endorsement from the group's political action committee in February 2008 when the Democratic primaries were in full swing. But that's not to say Republicans never support ACORN's efforts: McCain himself appeared at a 2006 rally in favor of immigration reform, sponsored in part by ACORN. The primary allegation against ACORN is that its voter registration drives result in many phony registrations. ACORN itself admits that some of its workers, in their attempts to meet registration goals, have turned in registration forms for people who do not exist or don't live in the geographic area. (Notorious examples include Mickey Mouse and the starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys.) ACORN says the problems are isolated, and that it works with officials to correct them. They claim to have registered 1.3-million people to vote, so a small number of irregularities are to be expected. (For more on ACORN and the controversy surrounding its voter registration drives, read the St. Petersburg Times story here .) Several states are investigating the group's voter registration efforts. The McCain campaign issued numerous charges about Obama's connection to ACORN in an Oct. 10, 2008, memo. For other charges, read our full story. Here, we'll look at the allegation that in 1992, Obama directed Project Vote, "an arm of ACORN that also encouraged voter registration." This year, Project Vote and ACORN worked together on a nationwide voter registration drive aimed at low-income, minority and youth voters. They have worked together on other initiatives with left-leaning groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women. But Project Vote and ACORN are separate organizations with different histories. ACORN was founded in 1970 in Little Rock, Ark., as an outgrowth of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Project Vote was launched more than a decade later in Washington, D.C. Michael Slater, the current executive director of Project Vote, said the two organizations are separate. And in 1992, the two groups didn't really work together, he said. They began partnerships on voter registration after Project Vote went through a reorganization in 1994, according to Slater. We also didn't find any evidence to indicate the two organizations had a relationship during the 1992 Illinois drive. A detailed article about Project Vote in Chicago magazine didn't mention ACORN. ACORN itself says Obama didn't work for them during that time. The 1992 voter registration drive came at an early point in Obama's political career. He had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991. He had returned to Chicago, where he spent his early 20s working as a community organizer, and was working on the book that would become his memoir Dreams From my Father . Obama started directing the Project Vote voter registration drive in April 1992, and ran it the rest of the year until Election Day. Bill Clinton carried Illinois that November, and Democrat Carol Moseley-Braun won one of the state's Senate seats, becoming the first African-American woman to serve as a U.S. senator. People in Chicago seem to have credited at least a bit of those victories to Obama's registration drive, which reportedly brought 150,000 new voters to the rolls. Chicago magazine called his initiative "one of the most important local stories" of the campaign season. Crain's Chicago Business named him to its annual "40 under 40" list and wrote that he had "galvanized Chicago's political community, as no seasoned politico had before." Is it possible that ACORN and Project Vote were going about the same business in Illinois in 1992? Sure. Both groups have the stated goal of getting people to register to vote, especially low-income, minority and young voters. But we find no evidence that Obama's 1992 work was for ACORN. We rate McCain's claim False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-17T00:00:00	2008-10-10	['None']
pomt-08209	The dollar "has fallen over 44% since Bernanke began pumping money into the system beginning back in 2002."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/19/virginia-tea-party-patriots/virginia-tea-party-says-dollar-has-fallen-44-perce/	The Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation has joined a growing chorus of conservatives blasting Federal Reserve System Chairman Ben Bernanke’s plan to buy $600 billion in additional U.S. Treasury bonds. In a sharply worded open letter to Virginia’s Congressional delegation, the Federation asks legislators to slow the printing of U.S. currency, curtail spending and audit the Fed. "Chairman Bernanke's new program, which the Fed says it will ‘adjust as needed,’ is an open-ended threat to the U.S. Dollar," the letter states. "Americans have to stop and question why our sovereign currency, the U.S. dollar, has fallen over 44% since Bernanke began pumping money into the system beginning back in 2002." The 44 percent figure piqued our interest and we wondered what they were measuring the dollar against. Asked for the source of their information, the letter’s co-authors, Jamie Jacoby and Bob Marcellus, referred to a 2008 Forbes magazine column by economist Steve Hanke. "The currency began its downward course early in 2002, thanks in large part to Fed policy, and it bottomed out in mid-July 2008, having declined 44% against the euro in that period," Hanke wrote. OK, so we now know that the dollar’s decline in the claim is set against the euro standard. But, 2008 was a while ago, so we wondered how the dollar compared to the euro today versus 2002. As of Nov. 15, the EUR/USD rate (American dollars to one euro) is at 1.36 compared with 0.87 in February 2002, a drop of 56 percent. But that brings up the second issue with the claim -- Bernanke didn’t join the Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors until September 2002, not early 2002 when the dollar began to decline. Bernanke didn’t become chairman until 2006, succeeding Alan Greenspan. "I think it’s foolish to assign blame for the U.S. foreign exchange rate to Dr. Bernanke when he was a member but not the Chair of the Federal Reserve," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Brookings Institution. "How much influence can a single, very junior member of the Board have?" Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the free-market Cato Institute, saw that point, but added that Bernanke wasn’t exempt from responsibility. "Greenspan was the Chairman, so he really deserves a lot of the blame," Mitchell said, "On the other hand, Bernanke supported those policies." So, let’s get back to numbers. If we look at change in the EUR/USD rate from September 2002, when Bernanke joined the Fed, until now, it has gone from 0.98 to 1.36, meaning that the value of the dollar has dropped 39 percent. By that measure, we’re pretty close to the 44 percent used in the claim. Is that good enough? Maybe not, says Burtless. "The reason I do not take the letter writer’s claim very seriously is that he or she has selected just one currency to judge the trend in the value of the dollar," he said. "It happens to be a currency that has appreciated relative to the dollar. Other currencies have fallen in value relative to the dollar." Burtless suggested using another measure to track the change -- the trade-weighted U.S. Dollar Index, a broad measure of the value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of our major trading partners. From September 2002 through Nov.15, the index has fallen from 126.17 to 98.82, a 22 percent decline. But as Mitchell points out, the euro/dollar comparison is commonly used and widely accepted. "If we shift from surface-level political debates to academic analysis, then a broader measure of currencies would be a better benchmark," he said. "After all, what if the dollar was falling because of something that the [European Central Bank] was doing rather than easy-money policy by the Fed? But the euro is the benchmark, so that is how the debate is usually framed in DC." If we to accept that, is it fair to lay all the blame on the Fed? Robertson says no. "Part of the decline since the worst of the crisis, say, late 2008-spring 2009, is due to the rebound of other major currencies," he said. "The dollar almost always rallies in crises (it's a safe haven for worriers), so the subsequent decline in normal times is to be expected. In the longer run the dollar's decline is because our industries are not internationally competitive with a high dollar, and that has little to do with Bernanke or the Fed." To summarize: The Tea Party’s letter says that the dollar has fallen 44 percent "since Bernanke began pumping money into the system beginning back in 2002." The number that the Tea Party uses reflects a different time period than Bernanke’s actual term as chairman and even as a member of the Board of Governors. Since Bernanke joined the Board in 2002, the value of the dollar dropped 39% against the euro, not 44%. The Tea Party’s statement also relies on one measurement of U.S. currency -- against the euro -- instead of a broader comparison to several major world currencies. Using that standard, the dollar has fallen 22%. Nevertheless, the letter’s point that the value of the dollar has fallen sharply since 2002 is undeniable, even if the decline is more gradual using indexes other than the euro and even if Bernanke had limited influence for four of the eight years. Therefore, we find the claim to be Half True.	None	Virginia Tea Party Patriots	None	None	None	2010-11-19T11:42:08	2010-11-15	['Ben_Bernanke']

pomt-05867	David Dewhurst has a "record of promoting an income tax."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/feb/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhurst-has-record-promoting-/	U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz gave reporters a humor-tinged handout about front-running David Dewhurst before the Republican candidates’ Austin debate in January. The handout listed reasons Dewhurst, the state’s lieutenant governor, might duck the debate -- which Dewhurst did not. On the list: One of Dewhurst’s horses threw a shoe; Dewhurst, who is wealthy, was in Tokyo; his private jet broke down. We fixed on reason No. 2: "Come on, would you want to show up and have to defend your record promoting an income tax?" Texas is one of nine states lacking a state income tax. The last statewide elected official to publicly suggest one, the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, left office in early 1999, nearly eight years after he briefly maintained that a state personal income tax made economic sense. The prospect proved so unpopular, Bullock later ushered in a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval before a personal income tax can become law. So, we wondered about Cruz’s claim. At the debate, reporter Brad Watson of Dallas’ WFAA-TV asked Cruz what proof he had of Dewhurst promoting an income tax. Cruz replied that in 2006, Dewhurst told The Associated Press, "I think I’d rather see a tax that is based on income." Also, Cruz said, the Wall Street Journal editorialized in 2005 that Dewhurst was "pushing what he called a wage tax." Cruz, quoting the editorial, continued: "A wage tax is of course a fancy disguise for a personal income tax." It’s way-back time. To assess Cruz’s claim, we looked into the mid-decade efforts by state leaders to overhaul the state’s tax system partly to drive down local school property taxes. Those debates culminated in a 2006 revision of the business franchise tax and other tax changes. First, let’s plumb the articles offered by Cruz as proof of Dewhurst’s actions. A March 30, 2006, AP news article, headlined "Businesses studying proposed tax structure," indeed quotes Dewhurst as saying: "I think I'd rather see a tax that's based on income — you earn money, you pay something, you don't earn money, you don't pay anything." We can see why a critic would single out that comment, though the full AP story indicates that Dewhurst was speaking to the particulars of revamping the business franchise tax rather than advancing his desire to create a personal or business income tax. The story initially points out that lawmakers had previously stumbled over how to restructure the business tax, which most corporations did not owe. "They worried that proposals would not apply equally to different business structures," the article says. "And business-friendly Republicans have been hesitant to levy a new tax that could be harmful to job creation and economic growth." According to the story, the consensus proposed fix -- which was a plan devised by a panel headed by John Sharp, a former Texas state comptroller -- would tax businesses on a percentage of their gross receipts, meaning the money a company brought in before expenses, with each company choosing between deductions for cost of goods sold or employee benefits like salary and health care. The story says sole proprietors and general partnerships would be exempt, along with companies that have annual gross receipts of $300,000 or less. For more than 80 years, the story says, the state’s main business tax had been based on a company’s net assets, though lawmakers changed it in 1991 to make it more like a corporate income tax. Texas companies subsequently had the choice of paying either 0.25 percent of the value of their net assets or 4.5 percent of their net corporate income, whichever was greater, according to a 2003 report on Texas taxes by the nonpartisan House Research Organization. In 2006, lawmakers revised the franchise tax along the lines of the Sharp proposal. The March 2006 AP story, published before lawmakers acted, says two business groups seemed receptive to the proposed overhaul. But it quotes the president of the Texas Auto Dealers Association expressing concern that a gross receipts-based tax would be assessed against businesses even if they had not earned a profit. Next, the story quotes Dewhurst as saying that the Texas Senate, over which he presides, is sensitive to that concern. It then quotes him saying he’d rather see a tax based on income so if you earn money, you pay something and if you don’t, you do not. Dewhurst appears to have reconsidered his comment the next day -- or, perhaps, recognized how it might be taken as a politically risky, Bullock-like call for a state income tax. According to an April 1, 2006, Houston Chronicle news article, Dewhurst "retreated from his statement a day earlier that he favored basing a business tax on a company's income, rather than its gross receipts." The story quotes Dewhurst saying: "I have always opposed a business or personal income tax." Cruz told us in a telephone interview that he reads Dewhurst’s initial comment as noted by the AP as indicating he was for a business income tax. He urged us to put stock as well in the May 10, 2005, Journal editorial, headlined "Deep in the Heart of Texas," which takes Dewhurst to task for state budget and tax proposals then in circulation within the Republican-led Legislature. The editorial states that Texas’ status as a state without an income tax is "in serious peril," continuing: "Both the state Senate and House have endorsed what Mr. Dewhurst -- whose post of lieutenant governor is nearly as powerful as governor in the state -- is calling a ‘wage tax.’ A wage tax is of course a fancy disguise for a personal income tax, and imposing one is a sure way to put a state on the path to slower growth." Cruz told us: "The wage tax that (Dewhurst) promoted is effectively the same thing as an income tax," though Dewhurst, he said, "wasn’t foolish enough to use the label ‘income tax.’" The Journal editorial airs concerns about possible tax increases to cover cuts in school property taxes, among them a new wage or payroll tax, which the editorial calls a toll on employers for hiring workers. Finally, Cruz suggested significance in Dewhurst’s subsequent letter to the Journal regarding the editorial; the response talks up the Senate’s tax plan, but is silent on the Journal’s likening of a wage/payroll tax to a business income tax. With Cruz’s backup laid out, let’s turn to other signs of an income tax plan being offered or endorsed by Dewhurst in 2005-06. A Nexis search for such news articles shows the House and Senate each explored numerous tax ideas. We spotted no stories on Dewhurst or anyone in the Republican leadership promoting a personal or business income tax. But two conservative observers said payroll tax elements of proposed House and Senate franchise tax overhauls amounted to income taxes. Some nitty gritty: The House in March 2005 approved a revenue package that offered companies a choice of paying the existing franchise tax or a 1.15 percent payroll tax on salaries up to $90,000 a year. In May 2005, the Senate answered with a plan allowing companies to choose the lower of two taxes, as long as they generate more money than a minimum tax of 0.25 percent of gross receipts. As described in a May 12, 2005, Austin American-Statesman news article, the first option for businesses was to pay 2.5 percent of the sum of their net taxable income plus payroll, though they could deduct from the tax base either half of their payrolls or $30,000 per employee plus the cost of some health benefits. The second option in the Senate plan would have required companies to pay a 1.75 percent payroll tax, capped at $1,500 per employee. In an opinion column published in the American-Statesman March 16, 2005, Matthew J. Griffing of the Young Conservatives of Texas said House Speaker Tom Craddick, a Republican, was to blame for the House advancing its payroll tax, which Griffing called a backdoor income tax. "Of course, the Republican leadership does not have the courage to call this an income tax or assess it directly against the people. Instead, it calls it a ‘payroll tax’ and assesses it against employers rather than employees," Griffing wrote. And a May 21, 2005, AP news article quotes a former U.S. House Majority Leader, Dick Armey of Texas, as saying the payroll elements of the business tax proposals were the same as income taxes. The AP article, foreshadowing that year’s legislative failure to agree on how to fund cuts in school property taxes, points out that elements of measures approved by the House or Senate "include some form of a tax on wages." Critics, including Armey, the story says, "call the proposals a disguised income tax, which is illegal in Texas." It quotes Armey urging Gov. Rick Perry to stop the "wage tax" in its tracks but quotes Dewhurst as saying the proposed payroll tax was not an income tax. Was the lieutenant governor right about that? Close observers of the 2005-06 tax debate told us the payroll tax elements might have been objectionable, but they weren’t generally taken as income tax schemes. Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, said in a telephone interview the taxes would have been paid by employers on top of wages -- instead of being taken out of individual pay checks like an income tax. "I don’t think anyone in the Capitol thought of that as being an income tax. If they had, it wouldn’t have gotten past the (committee) hearing stage," Hammond said. Laura Hoke, spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business in Texas, said the group opposed the payroll tax proposals as job killers, but did not view them as income tax plans. Dale Craymer, president of the business-membership Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, and tax analyst Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, each said the payroll tax elements were not income taxes. Lavine, who has helped the center urge lawmakers to establish a state personal income tax since the mid-1990s, said he would not call the payroll tax elements income taxes partly because they failed to tap all forms of income -- such as capital gains. Broadly, Craymer said, "there never was an income tax proposal" from, or supported by, Dewhurst. Lavine agreed. Finally, we consulted two out-of-state tax experts who each said he wouldn’t characterize payroll taxes, sometimes imposed by individual communities, as income taxes because they’re levied as a percentage of an employer’s payroll rather than being taken out of each employee’s wages. Seen another way, payroll taxes are not based on a firm’s income, Richard Pomp, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, said in a telephone interview. Instead, Pomp said, they’re tied to the costs of doing business. After we described the payroll tax approaches considered in Texas, Michael McIntyre, a professor at the Wayne State University School of Law, saw significance in their not being based on all employees' wages, while he said income taxes are typically levied on all workers. "I’d probably say it’s some other tax," McIntyre said. Our ruling Contrary to Cruz’s claim, Dewhurst has not promoted a personal or business income tax. It's even a stretch to say he edged in that direction in March 2006 with the comment he quickly forsook. All told, the idea that Dewhurst has a record of promoting an income tax is so far from accurate, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2012-02-10T06:00:00	2012-01-12	['None']
pomt-09265	"Klein did not hold a single town hall meeting (on health care) where the general public was invited to ask questions or present their views."	false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/30/allen-west/west-wrong-claim-klein-didnt-hold-single-town-hall/	Allen West, a Republican who is running for the South Florida congressional seat held by Democratic Rep. Ron Klein, accuses the incumbent of ducking the public during the debate about health care reform. In a press release March 21, 2010, West said: "Klein did not hold a single town hall meeting where the general public was invited to ask questions or present their views. Klein hid behind controlled environments such as telephone conference calls and tightly controlled meetings. He refused my offer to debate him on this topic at a place and time of his choosing." For this item, we are focusing on whether West is right that Klein did not hold a "single'' town hall meeting open to the public. Last summer, town hall meetings about health care across the country drew angry protesters who turned the usually calm meetings into shouting matches. In August, a monthly public meeting run by Klein's staff at a library in Broward County that typically draws few constituents drew more than 100 in an event orchestrated by Klein's Republican rival West, the Miami Herald wrote. Protesters called Klein a "coward" and a "communist'' and waved signs with statements including "Obama Care is a big lie.'' Klein did not attend that meeting. There is no dispute that when the health care debate hit a fever pitch last August, Klein chose to hold an Aug. 26 town hall meeting by telephone rather than in person. Klein told the Miami Herald that he disagreed with a suggestion that he was trying to avoid meeting with residents in person and argued that he could reach more people through "tele-town halls." "I will compare my record on town hall meetings with anyone in the Congress," Klein said in an Aug. 6 article. "I've always been very out there and willing to meet with people, and we're going to continue to do that." More than 300 people got in touch with Klein's office asking to participate and automated calls went out to numbers in Klein's district which attracted more than 6,000 to the call, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel wrote in the Broward Politics blog Aug. 26, 2009. Klein gave a nine-minute introduction and answered more than 15 questions during the next hour. We asked West's campaign for proof that Klein did not hold a single public in-person town hall on health care. But they presented none. "We stand by our comment, he has never held a single town hall meeting,'' said Josh Grodin, West campaign spokesperson. "I believe that is going to be in the public domain." So we took that as a challenge and turned to the public domain and searched Nexis and Google for any examples of Klein holding an in-person town hall meeting on health care. We didn't count news reports after the fact that simply quoted Klein's office as saying they held a public town hall meeting. For example, we didn't count a Naked Politics blog post Aug. 13, 2009 in which Klein's office publicized a meeting they had the day before with 100 residents of the Abbey Delray South retirement community because that event only drew condo residents and congressional staff. And we didn't count brief mentions on websites of organizations -- for example, the Temple Beth El newsletter saying Klein was going to speak at a Brotherhood brunch about health care. Those didn't seem to be the public town halls that West was talking about. But we did find one item from the Sun Sentinel Boca Raton Forum blog headlined "Klein to talk about health care and veterans' issues this week." It was posted June 29, 2009, and said, "Congressman Ron Klein will be in Boca Raton this week discussing health care and veterans' issues. Klein will host a health care town hall from 2 to 3:30 p.m. June 29 at the Boca Raton Community Hospital’s Dawson Theater, 800 Meadows Road, and his staff will assist constituents with health care casework." That's not a lot of notice, but it shows Klein had notified the news media -- and the public -- about the meeting. That one alone disproves West's claim, but we wondered if there were others. Klein's office sent us a list of events where Klein spoke to the public about health care. We then asked Klein's office for evidence that his office announced the meetings in advance. Klein's spokeswoman Melissa Silverman sent back a few media advisories that outlined Klein's upcoming schedule at various events, including for events about health care. We found two additional examples that advertised public meetings on health care: * An advisory dated April 6, 2009 included a 2 p.m. April 7 event: "Listening Tour on Health Care, Bethesda Memorial Hospital, Clayton Conference Center, 2815 South Seacrest Blvd, Boynton Beach." * An advisory dated Oct. 23, 2009 included a 9:30 a.m. Oct. 26 event: " Health Care Listening Tour – Memorial Hospital, 3501 Johnson Street, Hollywood. Klein's office also sent us copies of e-mail messages sent to constituents and community leaders about the listening events in Boynton Beach and Boca Raton. "A town hall, hearing from you on the future of health care,'' they say. We sent the one item we found, and the additional two that Klein's staff pointed out, to West's campaign and asked for a response. "We stand by our comment that he has never held a single town hall meeting open to the general public,'' Grodin wrote in an email. "If Klein is advertising his town hall meetings in blogs that are likely never going to be read by a vast majority of his constituents, it clearly indicates a lack of openness that he and his boss, Nancy Pelosi, promised when they took over Congressional Leadership. Furthermore, the fact that (PolitiFact staffer) Amy Sherman has had to do such extensive research to find 'proof' of 'Town Hall' meetings goes to show just how difficult it must have been for the general public to find out such information. Town Hall meetings should be widely advertised to citizens, not email blasted to members of the media." We don't agree with the West campaign's interpretation. Indeed, the reason that congressional offices "blast" e-mails to the media about these events is to advertise them widely. And to West's claim, we find Klein provided notice and held at least three public events on health care. We find West's claim to be False.

pomt-12907	"[The Foundation for Individual Rights] is the recipient of donations from [DeVos] totaling about 25,000 bucks over four years."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jan/19/bob-casey/trumps-education-pick-donated-philly-group-controv/	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Education is facing questions about her connections to an organization that has lobbied for more rights for college students accused of sexual assault. U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat who co-introduced the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act of 2013, Tuesday questioned Michigan billionaire and GOP donor Betsy DeVos about how to fight sexual violence on campus during a confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Specifically, Casey said the Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights in Education supports a bill that "would change the standard of evidence." He said the group is in favor of ditching the "preponderance of the evidence" standard most commonly used in Title IX investigations on college campuses and instead using the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard used in criminal cases. But Casey went further, saying just before he ran out of time: "The organization that has that position which is contrary to the law, the current law, and contrary to the spirit of what we’re trying to do in that piece of legislation, is the recipient of donations from you totaling about $25,000 bucks over four years… I hope that’s not a conflict of interest." DeVos didn’t have time to respond, though a Trump transition team spokeswoman said "had she been given the opportunity to respond to the Senator's question, she would have noted that previous donations made as a private citizen cannot present a conflict of interest." Casey announced Wednesday he will vote against DeVos' nomination. But we were curious: Did DeVos donate to a group that wants to dismantle current campus sexual assault practices as he described? So we decided to check. First, some background. Some studies suggest one in five women are sexually assaulted before they graduate college. PolitiFact has found that it’s difficult to determine the number of sexual assaults on college campuses because underreporting is so pervasive. Casey’s bill that was passed in 2013, commonly known as the Campus SaVE Act, was passed as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. It was an update to the 1990 Jeanne Clery Act, which requires any college or university that receives federal funding to annually disclose campus crime, including reported incidents of sexual violence. The Campus SaVE Act doesn’t dictate what standard of evidence college campuses use to evaluate disciplinary action against a person accused of sexual assault. It only requires transparency and that schools disclose what standard of evidence they’re using. In 2011 though, a "Dear Colleague" letter released by the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education urged universities to adopt a preponderance of the evidence standard in the commission of Title IX investigations. This standard, which is used in civil litigation, is lower than the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard used in criminal trials and requires those evaluating the claims find that it’s simply more likely than not that a violation occurred. For the most part, Democrats and women’s advocacy groups have lobbied in favor of asking colleges and universities to use the preponderance of the evidence standard during disciplinary proceedings and Title IX investigations. Other groups, including the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, say that standard strips away a student’s right to due process. The group is sponsoring a lawsuit that challenges the legality of the "Dear Colleague" guidance. FIRE, founded in 1999, says its mission is to "defend and sustain individual rights at America’s colleges and universities" including "freedom of speech, legal equality, due process, religious liberty, and sanctity of conscience." During the hearing Tuesday, Casey said FIRE received $25,000 from "you," referring to DeVos, over the course of four years. A spokeswoman for Casey said the claim came from staff research based on publicly available IRS filings made by the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation, a nonprofit founded by DeVos and her husband that dispenses millions of dollars a year in charitable and political giving. Indeed, filings by the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation show the organization donated $25,000 to FIRE over the course of four years between 2010 and 2013 in four separate donations. The forms also list the couple as the sole donors to the foundation. The foundation and Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. It’s important to note that the $25,000 in donations is a fraction of the money dispensed by the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation in the years in question. The foundation routinely doles out more than $10 million a year in contributions to charities and conservative causes across the country. FIRE has faced criticism from women’s advocacy organizations for its stance on issues related to sexual assault on campuses. The group frequently represents students accused of sexual assault who have lodged complaints against institutions of higher education and has been critical of the White House Task Force on Campus Sexual Assault, saying it jeopardizes student due process. The nonprofit has come out against measures like California’s "Yes Means Yes" affirmative consent bill, a piece of legislation hailed by women’s advocacy groups. FIRE also posted a story on its website in 2011 titled "The Politics of Campus Sexual Assault" in which the author writes that "much of the feminist ‘war on rape’ has conflated sexual assault with muddled, often alcohol-fueled, sexual encounters that involve miscommunication, perhaps bad behavior, but no criminal coercion." FIRE released a statement on DeVos’ nomination, saying: "Protecting civil liberties on campus is not, and must not become, a partisan issue." The group wrote that while it’s most famous for its work protecting free speech on campus, it has "long advocated for due process rights in campus proceedings more generally." Samantha Harris, FIRE's vice president of policy research, said the organization doesn't advocate for a specific standard of evidence, but rather "we don't think the federal government should mandate a standard." "When it comes to due process, it's really not a zero sum game," Harris said. "It's not the rights of the accused versus victims' rights. The integrity of the process is important for everyone." Our Ruling U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, during a confirmation hearing for Secretary of Education pick Betsy DeVos, said "[The Foundation for Individual Rights] is the recipient of donations from you (DeVos) totaling about 25,000 bucks over four years." IRS filings show those numbers check out. While the checks weren’t written by DeVos herself, they were dispensed by a foundation in which she and her husband were the sole donors during the years in question. However, DeVos and her husband were not the only board members. We rate the claim Mostly True. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly characterized the standard of evidence used in criminal convictions.	None	Bob Casey	None	None	None	2017-01-19T11:00:00	2017-01-17	['None']
pomt-00654	"The proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/17/kathleen-sullivan/anti-marijuana-advocate-says-treatment-levels-have/	When the House Judiciary Committee was considering legislation to tax and regulate marijuana, Kathleen Sullivan, Warren’s substance abuse coordinator, stepped forward to warn the committee about the dangers of marijuana use. "We do know that the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years," she told the committee during the April 29 hearing. When we contacted her for details, she emailed statistics collected from the states by the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Her data on admissions for substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, ranged from 1993 through 2011, a year shy of the 20 years she spoke of. According to those statistics, the rate of admissions in 1993 was 96 per 100,000 Rhode Islanders age 12 and older. In 2011, the rate was 166 admissions. But this wasn’t the highest that the rate has ever been over the past two decades. It peaked at 218 in 2009 and then declined in the next two years. The number of admissions, unadjusted for population, peaked that year as well, and then dropped. When we looked at the number of admissions that the federal agency reported online for 2012 and 2013, we found that the decline has continued, showing a drop each year since 2009. In her email, Sullivan qualified her statement saying: "I was referring to the overall trend in marijuana admissions." So we took another look at the data and examined the trend in admission rates, even though she didn’t make this distinction in her testimony. The trend from beginning to end for admissions per 100,000 teens and adults has been up over the past two decades. But if you look at the trend line since 1999, there has been no statistically significant increase. We also contacted the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration directly and officials there told us there are limitations to the data that make Sullivan's position problematic. One major problem is that an individual can be counted more than once each year depending on how many times he or she has been admitted for treatment, explained Kelley Smith, a statistician with the administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. Smith said the data, known as the Treatment Episode Data Set or TEDS, do not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. "Not according to TEDS," Smith said in an email. "According to TEDS, the percentages have remained relatively stable." Our ruling Kathleen Sullivan said the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, has reached its highest point in 20 years. Her documentation shows a peak in 2009, but then admissions decline through 2011. More recent data show the decline has continued. Further, our trend analysis shows no increase since 1999. And a federal statistician at the agency that compiled the data said admission rates have been "relatively stable" over the past 20 years. We rate her statement False.

pomt-03342	On residency requirements for public workers	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/21/chris-abele/twists-turns-tale-county-executive-chris-abele-and/	In the months-long war of words between local officials and Gov. Scott Walker over ending residency rules for government workers, one episode in the endgame escaped with little notice. Ten days before Walker signed the 2013-’15 state budget, which included a provision prohibiting local governments from enforcing residency, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to oppose the change. But Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele declined to back the effort, returning the resolution unsigned, and not until 10 days after Walker approved the budget on June 30. County supervisors were surprised, saying that Abele had favored the lobbying effort, which dovetailed with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s fight to retain the rules. This is a case for the Flip-O-Meter. That’s what we use to determine if a public official has changed position on an issue. An important note: We’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch. We’re looking at whether the candidate has been consistent. Walker says residency rules, long opposed by unions, scare off some would-be job applicants. Barrett, who hopes to overturn the state’s action in court, says there’s no shortage of qualified applicants, and that public employees should contribute toward their publicly funded benefits by paying local property taxes. Where has Abele stood? March 2011: In the special election to replace Walker as Milwaukee County Executive, Abele differed on residency rules with opponent Jeff Stone, a Republican state representative. Asked about legislation being discussed in the Legislature to free Milwaukee teachers, police officers and firefighters from residency rules, Stone said he would vote to lift the rules. Abele said the rules should stay. He agreed with Barrett, who raised concerns at the time that Milwaukee could be harmed as Detroit was when public workers left following the lifting of residency. Hiring from the broadest possible pool of potential employees is desirable, Abele told WISN-TV’s Mike Gousha, but "there’s a reason to be concerned" in the short run about the impact of workers leaving the city. In the end, state lawmakers did not act on the residency issue. June 2012: Abele, at this point in office for more than a year, expressed "mixed feelings" about Milwaukee County’s own residency rules as he defended giving one of his top appointees a four-year waiver on moving into the county under the county’s residency rules. County Board supervisors said they were blindsided by the waiver that Abele’s administration gave to economic development director Brian Taffora. July 2012: When the County Board moved to give itself authority to approve such waivers, Abele vetoed the measure. He fleshed out his "mixed feelings" on the issue, saying that having the board more involved would make it harder to "hire and retain outstanding employees from across the state and country." But Abele’s spokesman, Brendan Conway, told a reporter that Abele wasn’t trying to "overthrow" the county’s residency policy. November 2012: A month before Taffora resigned rather than face a renomination fight, Abele told WTMJ radio’s John Mercure he was "kind of agnostic" on residency requirements. Again, he expressed mixed feelings, decrying "artificial limits" that can harm recruiting, but also saying that Taffora still intended to move to the county and comply with the rule if he could sell his house in Ozaukee County. February 2013: Shortly after Walker put a broad provision in the budget blocking municipalities statewide from enforcing residency, Barrett began his pushback campaign. Abele joined in, doing an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Feb. 21, 2013. The mayor saw it as a "public indication he had supported our efforts," spokeswoman Jodie Tabak told PolitiFact Wisconsin. The story did not detail Abele’s reasoning. June 2013: With Abele’s apparent blessing, a County Board committee on June 14, 2013 approved the resolution opposing the state move to prohibit local units of government, including Milwaukee County, from requiring residency requirements. Milwaukee County, as well as all other local units of government, "should retain the right to determine residency restrictions as deemed most effective for each particular community," the resolution stated. Abele "has no issues with this resolution," his deputy chief of staff, John Zapfel, told the committee before its vote. Asked by County Supervisor David Cullen if that meant Abele would sign it, Zapfel said: "That is my understanding, correct." Cullen told us Abele "had a chance to lend his voice to those who were asking Scott Walker to veto it. He chose not to. It was disappointing." Abele returned the resolution unsigned on July 9, 2013, catching Barrett by surprise, the mayor’s spokeswoman, Jodie Tabak, told us. The county executive’s message to the County Board did not discuss the merits of Walker’s move; rather, it said he was returning it unsigned because the state budget was complete and the prohibition was taking effect. We asked Abele why he didn’t sign the resolution after his aide assured supervisors he would. Abele said Zapfel may not have been given a clear idea of his position. Abele told us he spoke out in support of retaining residency only in the context of public safety workers in Milwaukee. He said he was responding to the passionate stance taken by political ally Barrett and Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn. We found no record of Abele parsing the issue that way during the five-month lobbying campaign by Barrett. Walker’s proposal was to eliminate the rules statewide, not just for Milwaukee. Our rating Abele’s statements and actions don’t constitute a full flip-flop, in our view. He clearly has some misgivings about residency rules for Milwaukee County government, so leaving the file unsigned is not a major reversal. Still, his actions and words have been inconsistent, to the point where both his political friends and his frequent foes on the County Board were taken aback by his withdrawal from the fight as the legislative battle drew to a close in June. Indeed, if Abele had the nuanced position he says he did, it was so closely held that even one of his top aides apparently was completely unaware of it. The Flip-O-Meter defines a half Flip as a partial change of position or inconsistent statements. That’s what we rate this one.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2013-07-21T05:00:00	2013-07-19	['None']

pomt-06270	The U.S. would gain revenue by cutting personal income tax rates in half and ending tax breaks.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/nov/25/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-us-would-gain-revenue-cutting-inc/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says Americans must be willing to sacrifice popular income tax exemptions if they are serious about cutting the national debt. The Virginia Democrat has long argued that the only realistic cure for the debt, now at $15.1 trillion, is a regimen of spending cuts and revenue increases. Warner has urged Congress to consider all options, including narrowing deductions for home mortgage interest and phasing in personal income taxes on health care benefits provided by employers. In an Oct. 31 interview on MSNBC, Warner promoted broad tax reform that would close loopholes -- called "tax expenditures" in congressional parlance -- and compensate filers for some of their loss by lowering personal income tax rates. He offered no specifics. "You can cut everybody’s (income) taxes in half and actually raise more revenues if you’re willing to get rid of all the tax expenditures, tax breaks," Warner told host Joe Scarborough. "We’re not suggesting you do all that, but there’s a lot of headroom there to be able to generate revenues and reduce rates." Personal incomes taxes are the federal government’s largest revenue source, providing 45 percent of its tax receipts. We were curious if the U.S. government could make money by slicing rates in half and clamping personal deductions. So we looked into it. Warner prefaced his claim to Scarborough with a familiar assertion: The U.S. gives up more in tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes. We examined that claim by him early this year and rated it True. During fiscal years 2009 and 2010, individuals received a total of about $1.98 trillion in breaks for the $1.85 trillion in income tax they paid, according to data from the Office of Management and Budget. We pored through the OMB spreadsheets again to get to the bottom of Warner’s latest claim. They detail 136 exemptions for personal income taxes and the estimated cost of each one. We rounded off the figures and added them up. For fiscal 2012 -- the federal budget year that began Oct. 1 -- the total estimated value of personal exemptions comes to $1.145 trillion. Uncle Sam expects to collect $1.140 trillion in personal income taxes. If the U.S. eliminated all the personal income tax loopholes and cut rates in half, that would result in about $574.2 billion in additional revenues for 2012. So Warner is correct. In fiscal 2011, Washington would have received about an extra $594 billion had personal income tax rates been halved and exemptions ended. We ran our computations by Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Commons Sense. "The numbers are all correct," he told us. "It makes sense." Warner has sought unsuccessfully this year to fashion a bipartisan debt reduction plan that would cut spending, raise revenues and simplify the tax code. "He’s not calling for instantly eliminating the most popular tax expenditures," said Kevin Hall, the senator’s spokesman. "There are a lot of different ideas that are out there for reform." The largest break to individuals is not having to pay income taxes on their employers’ contributions to their personal health care and health insurance premiums. That’s worth about $132 billion a year in taxes. A presidential commission, whose work Warner admired, last year recommended phasing it out by 2038. Second biggest break is the net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings, worth about $119 billion a year in annual taxes. The popular mortgage-interest deduction is worth $97 billion a year. Hall said Warner has spoken about restricting the deduction to principal residences and capping eligible mortgages for complete interest deduction at $750,000 mortgage, instead of the current $1 million. Our conclusion: Warner says the U.S. could raise money by cutting personal income rates in half and ending deductions.

pomt-12873	"The various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the president's executive order."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/29/jerrold-nadler/have-there-been-terrorist-attacks-post-911-countri/	President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the admission into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries and indefinitely banning refugees from war-torn Syria stirred an uproar across the nation, with protesters gathering at the nation’s largest airports. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a CNN interview from New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport that it was important to protect the United States from people who want to harm the country. But he argued that refugees are heavily vetted by the U.S. government and that recent attacks have not been from nationals of the countries singled out by Trump. "The various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the president's executive order," Nadler said in a CNN interview Jan. 28. "If you really want to protect this country, why are Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey left out of the order? Most of the 9/11 conspirators came from Saudi Arabia." Trump’s executive order signed Jan. 27, called "Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States," suspended for 90 days the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Individuals from those seven countries who are U.S. lawful permanent residents are also stopped from re-entering the country (though exemptions may apply), the New York Times reported, attributing the information to the Department of Homeland Security. We wondered if Nadler was correct by saying that since 9/11, terrorist acts in the United States have not been carried out by people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Experts told us no fatal attack has been attributed to nationals from those countries, but that there have been a few non-deadly acts by individuals from two of those countries. Increased homegrown terrorism According to New America, a think tank compiling information on terrorist activities in the United States since 9/11, 94 people have been killed by jihadists in the past 15 years. But in its overview of who are the individuals committing the attacks, New America says the majority of attackers come from within. "Far from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents. Moreover, while a range of citizenship statuses are represented, every jihadist who conducted a lethal attack inside the United States since 9/11 was a citizen or legal resident," the New America study says. "In addition about a quarter of the extremists are converts, further confirming that the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration." "It's certainly the case that none of the major, deadly attacks carried out in the United States were carried out by people from these countries," said Erin Miller, who manages the Global Terrorism Database for the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. Other experts agreed. "Since 9/11, no one has been killed in this country in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from any of the seven countries," added William C. Banks, director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University College of Law. In June 2016, Omar Mateen, born in the United States to Afghan parents, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in an Orlando nightclub shooting. In December 2015, a Pakistani woman, Tashfeen Malik, and her husband killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. The husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was born in the United States to Pakistani parents. However, there have been at least three non-deadly attacks in which the perpetrators were from Iran or Somalia, said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State University, expert on terrorism and a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. One of those examples includes the November 2016 attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who had lived in Pakistan before coming to the United States. Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 18, was shot dead by a police officer after he slammed his car into pedestrians and injured others with a butcher knife. The FBI said it would investigate the attack as a "potential act of terrorism." In September 2016, Dahir Adan was shot dead after stabbing nine people in a Minnesota shopping mall. Adan was identified by his father as Somali but born in Kenya, moving to the United States when he was a child. Another incident was in 2006, when Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar ran a Jeep Cherokee into a crowd of people at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. Thinking he would be killed during the attack, Taheri-Azar left a letter in his apartment saying he wanted revenge for the deaths of Muslims across the world caused by the United States, the AP reported. A naturalized citizen born in Iran, Taheri-Azar in 2008 plead guilty to nine counts of attempted first-degree murder and was sentenced for up to 33 years in prison. On ABC’s This Week, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the president’s order covered countries that the Obama administration had identified as needing further travel restrictions. "What the president did was take the first step through this executive order of insuring that we're looking at the entire system of who's coming in, refugees that are coming in, people who are coming in from places that have a history or that our intelligence suggests that we need to have further extreme vetting for," Spicer said Jan. 29. Starting in early 2016, individuals from countries that participate in the visa waiver program (that is, people allowed to travel to the United States without a visa) and who had also been in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Libya or Somalia recently (with exceptions for diplomatic or military purposes) were no longer permitted to come to the United States without a visa. They were not banned from traveling, but they did need to apply for a visa and be vetted. People who were nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria were also no longer able to come to the United States without a visa. Our ruling Nadler said, "The various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the president's executive order." Experts on terrorism tell us that since 9/11 no one in the United States has been killed in a terrorist attack by someone from the seven countries for which Trump’s executive order temporarily suspends admission. Those countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. But there have been at least three non-deadly cases in which the perpetrator was connected to Iran or Somalia. Nadler’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04623	Medicare "premium support" backed by Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan "is not vouchers."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/17/phil-gingrey/gingrey-medicare-reform-plan-does-not-create-vouch/	GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s decision to pick U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate unleashed a flood of partisan debate over Medicare. Georgia politicians are riding the rapids. The Wisconsin congressman is the architect of a plan to overhaul Medicare that Democrats have widely attacked as a "voucher system." During an interview on CNN, Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta used a more delicate term: "premium support." "Premium support is not vouchers," the co-chairman of the House Republican doctors caucus said Aug. 14. "A voucher would be, you hand money to a senior and say, ‘Hey, go find your health care,’ " he said. "This would be run by the Medicare trustees. … The money would stay there." So which one is it? "Premium support" or a voucher plan? Democrats have used the word "voucher" over the years to criticize Republican privatization proposals. Republicans don't like the word and try to avoid it PolitiFact National recently gave President Barack Obama a Mostly True when he said that Romney and Ryan "want to turn Medicare into a voucher system." Its inquiry started with the dictionary. Merriam-Webster defines a voucher as "a written affidavit or authorization ... a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school." "Premium support" describes a concept that’s been kicking around since the mid-1990s. Health policy experts Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution and Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director, defined the term in a 1995 study. Versions of premium support have appeared in other proposals since then. Broadly speaking, these proposals would change Medicare from a program in which the government pays the health care provider for services directly to one in which the government designates money for a beneficiary to spend on an insurance plan. The initial Ryan plan that used "premium supports" was released in early 2011. It was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate. Here’s what PolitiFact National has to say about this version: In this first version, for workers 55 and younger, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals for their services to one in which the government would designate a pot of money for each beneficiary to pay for private insurance premiums. Beneficiaries would have selected a plan from a group that complies with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which runs the health benefits program for federal employees. The beneficiary would receive an amount based in part on the cost of the second-least-expensive plan available on the exchange. The most recent version of Ryan’s plan has one key difference. He gave beneficiaries the option of selecting a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Does this mean Ryan’s plan is not a voucher system? Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber offered two main arguments to back up his statement: One: The government pays, not the senior "Premium support means the senior picks from a list of government-approved plans and then the government pays the bill," Talaber said. This argument falls short. Early proponents of premium support did not consider this to be a defining characteristic of the system. Even if they did, this type of approach would still fit the dictionary definition of "voucher," which we described above. Two: The amount of support would change to meet the rising cost of health care Talaber pointed us to a 2011 blog post written by Aaron, co-author of the study we mentioned above. "The defining attribute of the plans that Reischauer and I christened ‘premium support’ was that the amount of support was to be indexed to average healthcare costs, not, as in voucher plans, to a price index or per person income," Aaron wrote. The difference is crucial, Aaron wrote: "Voucher plans are virtually guaranteed to become increasingly inadequate; premium support plans will not." Aaron’s blog post, however, does not prove Gingrey’s point. As we mentioned above, Ryan’s plan indexes premium supports to the second-least-expensive plan available in the exchange -- not average health care costs. This difference opens Ryan’s plan to reasonable criticism that it may not share premium support’s defining characteristic. In the interest of fairness, we considered other arguments on why Ryan’s plan counts as premium support, not vouchers. Some backers of free-market reforms do think there’s a substantive difference, although experts interviewed by PolitiFact National differ on how to classify Ryan’s plan. Aaron himself told PolitiFact National that he thinks "premium support is a type of voucher." Further complicating the matter is that even among policy wonks, language tends to evolve over nearly two decades. Regardless, Ryan’s plan fits the dictionary definition of "voucher" pretty well. Gingrey’s statement that "premium support is not vouchers," has two main problems. It’s fair to argue that Ryan’s plan lacks an essential feature of "premium support" -- being indexed to average health care costs. We think this is a crucial shortcoming. Furthermore, the claim draws distinctions that are too fine for a general audience -- and even some experts. We give Gingrey a Mostly False.

pomt-11734	"Facebook picks sides in Alabama Senate race ... shuts down Gateway Pundit and Breitbart reports on discredited Allred accuser"	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/11/gateway-pundit/facebook-did-not-remove-gateway-pundit-report-afte/	On Friday, we rated as Pants on Fire a misleading headline on a blog about a statement made by a woman who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct. The headline on The Gateway Pundit read, "WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)." But Beverly Young Nelson, who accused Roy Moore of groping her when she was 16, never said she tampered with his signature or forged the inscription in her high school yearbook. "He wrote the note and signed his name," Nelson told ABC News. "I had wrote under it where it happened at." Allred, Nelson’s lawyer, clarified Nelson had added the "D.A. 12 -22-77 Olde Hickory House" to the note that read, "To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore." The most recent Gateway Pundit headline on the Nelson story was equally misleading. "Facebook Picks Sides in Alabama Senate Race=> Shuts Down Gateway Pundit and Breitbart Reports on Discredited Allred Accuser," the Gateway Pundit wrote in their headline. "The far left website Politifact said our story was not accurate and Facebook (then) shut it down," the post said. "No one will be able to see our story on Facebook." After we rated the story as Pants on Fire, Facebook ​flagged our report for its users as part of its effort to combat fake news. But both the Breitbart and Gateway Pundit articles are still searchable. We found them by scrolling down the Breitbart and Gateway Pundit Facebook pages. The claim that no one will be able to see the story on Facebook is flat-out wrong. Unless an article violates Facebook’s community standards, it’s not removed. Facebook does, however, downrank disputed articles. That means they are pushed lower down on users’ newsfeeds, although the severity of downranking varies. When a user tries to share the original Gateway Pundit story through Facebook, a pop-up appears saying "Before you share this content, you might want to know that there is additional reporting on this from PolitiFact." A hyperlink that says "Visit PolitiFact" redirects the sharer to our report. But if the user clicks Continue, they are able to share the story as usual. If a person reading the story through the Gateway Pundit website tries to share the content to Facebook, the pop-up window never appears. The same applies for Breitbart. Facebook does this for every story flagged as false. "Our take on facts is that objective facts are objective facts, and their political provenance is irrelevant," Facebook spokesman Todd Breasseale said. "It doesn’t matter if an objective fact was discovered or made apparent by a politically conservative organization or a politically liberal or an apolitical organization." (PolitiFact is a nonpartisan fact-checking organization.) Facebook relies on organizations like PolitiFact, Snopes, FactCheck.org and other fact-checkers to flag fake news. Our ruling A Gateway Pundit headline said, "Facebook picks sides in Alabama Senate race ... shuts down Gateway Pundit and Breitbart reports on discredited Allred accuser." Neither the Gateway Pundit nor the Breitbart stories were taken down from Facebook, as the headline suggests. Instead, the Facebook algorithm made the stories less prevalent, as occurs with every story flagged as fake. Those who sought to share the posts were informed of our report, but they could share them anyway. We rate this statement False.

pomt-11907	At a 2015 dedication of an FBI building in Florida, Rep. Frederica Wilson "stood up there ... and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money -- the $20 million -- to build the building. And she sat down."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/20/john-kelly/fact-checking-john-kelly-frederica-wilsons-2015-sp/	The White House continues to criticize U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., for publicizing a private phone call by President Donald Trump to the family of a slain servicemember. Wilson, a family friend, had been listening to the call from Trump in which he allegedly said Sgt. La David Johnson "knew what he signed up for … but when it happens it hurts anyway." Johnson was killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in the west African nation of Niger. After the call, Wilson told the Miami Herald, "I think it’s so insensitive. It’s crazy. Why do you need to say that? You don’t say that to someone who lost family, the father, the breadwinner. You can say, ‘I’m so sorry for your loss. He’s a hero.’ " See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A few days later, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly appeared behind the press room podium on Oct. 19 to offer the White House’s perspective on the call. In closing, he zeroed in on Wilson for criticism, citing the 2015 dedication of an FBI building in South Florida. Here are his comments in full, the emphasis is ours: "I was still on active duty, and I went to the dedication of the new FBI field office in Miami. And it was dedicated to two men who were killed in a firefight in Miami against drug traffickers in 1986. … Jim Comey gave an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to those fallen men and to all of the men and women of the FBI who serve our country so well, and law enforcement so well. There were family members there. Some of the children that were there were three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade. Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and gave a rendition of how brave those men were and how they gave their lives. "And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money -- the $20 million -- to build the building. And she sat down, and we were stunned. Stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned. But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us stood up and were appalled. We just said, okay, fine." Wilson responded by saying Kelly wasn’t telling the truth. "That’s a lie. How dare he," Wilson said on CNN. Luckily, a video can help settle this specific back-and-forth. A video unearthed by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel of the April 10, 2015, event preserved Wilson’s speech. While it does portray Wilson speaking animatedly and indulging in some braggadocio -- she is known as a colorful, outspoken politician with a soft spot for fashionable hats -- Kelly mischaracterized her remarks in significant ways. The effort she bragged about was initially requested by the FBI itself, and her actions were made in service of honoring the memory of the two slain agents. She also shared the credit, saying it could not have been accomplished without the help of her Republican colleagues, including then-House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Perhaps most notable, the video doesn’t show Wilson boasting about securing money for the building, which had been obtained before she was even in Congress. The video shows Wilson telling the audience that shortly before the dedication of a new FBI building in Miramar, Fla., the FBI approached her to see whether she could help name the building after FBI agents Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove, who were killed during a 1986 shootout with bank robbers south of Miami. Naming federal buildings is typically a responsibility of Congress. "The ribbon-cutting has been scheduled in four short weeks," Wilson recalled being told. "The dedication is on the government’s calendar and cannot be changed. One problem: The FBI wants to name this gorgeous edifice at the same time, in four weeks. Everyone said that’s impossible -- it takes at least eight months to a year to complete the process, through the House, the Senate and to the president’s office. "I said, I’m a school principal and I said, excuse my French, ‘Oh, hell no!’ We’re gonna get this done. Immediately I went to attack mode. I went to the Speaker, Speaker Boehner, and I said, "Mr. Speaker, I need your help. The FBI needs your help, and our country needs your help and we have no time to waste.’ (Boehner) went into attack mode, and in two days pulled it out of committee, brought it to the floor for a vote." At that point, Wilson said, she "dashed it over to the Senate," where Florida Sens. Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio helped get it to the floor in two days. "And guess what? The president signed the bill into law this past Tuesday, April 7, 2015, with a bang, bang, bang." Wilson did not mention anything about securing funding for the building, nor did she brag about using her influence with Obama. In an interview with the Miami Herald, Wilson called "crazy" Kelly’s notion that she claimed she had gotten the money. "That building was funded long before I got to Congress. I didn’t say that. I have staff, people who write the speeches. You can’t say that." The Herald reported that the General Services Administration "had already bid out a $144 million construction contract for the project in September 2010, just a few months before Wilson won her congressional seat. The bidding for federal projects takes place after Congress has secured the funding." The Herald also reported that the 380,000-square-foot pair of glass towers cost $194 million to build, much higher than the $20 million figure Kelly had mentioned. In reality, most of Wilson’s speech consisted of praise for the FBI and the slain agents. The quick action on the naming "speaks to the respect that our Congress has for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the men and women who put their lives on the line every single day," Wilson said. "And today we’re providing a boost to our nation by naming this fantastic building in honor of Special Agent Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove, who died valiantly … in what is still considered the bloodiest gun battle in the storied history of the FBI." She then urged everyone in law enforcement and first responders to stand up so the audience could applaud. "Stand up! We are proud of you," she said. Wilson then spent several moments specifically praising agents Grogan and Dove and telling their story. She continued, "Today, it is our patriotic duty to lift up Special Agent Benjamin Grogan and Special Agent Jerry Dove from the street in South Florida and place their names and pictures high, where the world will know that we are proud of their sacrifice, their sacrifice for our nation." Wilson concluded, "It is only fitting that their names should be placed on the same mantle with the letters ‘FBI,’ because special agents Grogan and Dove embody the sacred motto for which the agency has become known. Please repeat it after me: Fidelity, bravery, and integrity. God bless you, God bless the FBI, and God bless America." Just hours after the Sun-Sentinel posted the video, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House was standing by Kelly’s characterization of Wilson’s remarks. A reporter at the daily White House briefing asked, "Does Gen. Kelly still stand by the statement he made yesterday that he felt (Wilson) was grandstanding and that she was taking credit for funding?" Huckabee Sanders responded, "Absolutely. Gen Kelly said he was stunned that Rep. Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation. As Gen. Kelly pointed out, if you’re able to make a sacred act honoring American heroes all about yourself, you’re an empty barrel." When asked whether she had seen the Sun-Sentinel video, Huckabee Sanders said she had, and that it didn’t change her view. Wilson "also had quite a few comments that day that weren’t part of that speech and weren’t part of that video that were witnessed by many people that were there," Huckabee Sanders said. However, she declined to provide supporting evidence for that claim. When PolitiFact inquired with the White House, they did not provide any additional information. Our ruling Kelly said that Wilson "stood up there ... and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money -- the $20 million -- to build the building. And she sat down." However, in her speech, Wilson didn’t mention funding for the building, much less claim credit for it or tell the audience how she leveraged influence with Obama to secure it. Wilson did describe how she helped secure legislation to name the building for two slain agents, but Kelly’s description leaves out that the FBI pressed her to make that effort and that she shared credit with several other lawmakers, including the Republican House speaker and Florida’s Republican senator. Wilson also spoke at some length about the bravery of the slain agents and the FBI in general. We rate Kelly’s statement False.

pomt-03860	"We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/11/dianne-feinstein/regulation-commercial-drones/	So, the government can’t use a weaponized drone to strike down a U.S. citizen who’s "not engaged in combat," says Attorney General Eric Holder. But can paparazzi use camera-laden drones to violate Hollywood’s privacy? U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein says so. Feinstein, chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, chatted with Hardball host Chris Matthews the day after Sen. Rand Paul’s 13-hour filibuster over U.S. drone policy. Paul was concerned about a March 4, 2013, letter from the attorney general that didn’t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil. A new letter satisfied his curiosity. But his March 6 "drone rant," as the Wall Street Journal called it, raised criticism from lawmakers, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. On MSNBC, Matthews asked Feinstein: Was Rand "playing to the paranoia in people"? Feinstein replied that armed drones are a "new technology" and a "very dangerous weapon," that she wants to keep out of the hands of other nations. Then she said: "We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use. You can see drones some day hovering over the homes of Hollywood luminaries, violating privacy. "This question has to be addressed. And we need rules of operation on the border, by police, by commercial use, and also by military and intelligence use. "So this is now a work in progress. We are taking a look at it on the Intelligence Committee, trying to draft some legislation. The administration is looking at a rules playbook as to how these won't be used and how they will be used." About armed drones, we’ve heard plenty in recent days, thanks to Paul. But Feinstein’s privacy claim caught our eye. Do "we have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use"? The FAA We gave Feinstein’s office a day or two to explain her comments, but her staff didn’t offer an on-the-record response. So we chatted with experts on drones, also known as "unmanned aircraft systems," and read up on Federal Aviation Administration rules. That’s right — there are FAA rules. Do they address "commercial use" of drones? Yes. The only way for folks who don’t work in government to get FAA approval to fly a drone in U.S. airspace is to get something called an "experimental airworthiness certificate." And the FAA doesn’t give them out for commercial use. "The FAA's rules — once you can find them — are pretty clear: You cannot use a drone for a commercial purpose without a permit," said Matt Waite, who founded the Drone Journalism Lab at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. "And, the FAA has made it pretty clear that those permits are really only for research and development and in very limited circumstances," he added. "So, it amounts to a total ban on commercial (use)." Waite would know: Students and faculty in his lab "research the ethical, legal and regulatory issues involved in using pilotless aircraft to do journalism." And even he hasn’t yet been able to score an FAA certificate. Full disclosure: Before Waite joined the University of Nebraska in 2011 to teach reporting and digital product development, he was an employee of the Tampa Bay Times who helped create PolitiFact. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a nonprofit group that represents members interested in promoting drone technology, also told us that Feinstein was mistaken. "There are a number of regulations on commercial flights of unmanned systems," said Melanie Hinton, a spokeswoman for the group. Not only that, Hinton said, but currently, that includes "no commercial use." That looks to us like the opposite of what Feinstein said. Still, Feinstein has a point about privacy, said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington and author of the article, "The Drone as Privacy Catalyst." He notes federal privacy laws haven’t kept pace with drone technology, and that while the FAA currently bans commercial use of drones, Congress has asked for new regulations for civilian drones by 2015. Lawmakers want to "safely accelerate" the use of such drones, according to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, a piece of legislation that Feinstein supported. "In this respect, she is correct," Calo said. Still, the agency has said it will address concerns about privacy as it develops a new regulatory framework. It’s just not yet clear whether the new rules will satisfy privacy advocates. That’s because it's still in the middle of rulemaking, and plans more public outreach. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, for example, petitioned the FAA to take privacy into account as it drafts its rules. The FAA agreed, saying the month before Feinstein’s comment that it "intends to address these issues through engagement and collaboration with the public." But final privacy requirements are still under development. Our ruling Feinstein said, "We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use." Feinstein’s wrong: Not only does the FAA regulate the commercial use of drones, it actually bans it. Still, the landscape is changing. At Congress’ direction, the FAA is drafting new regulations. How those rules will address privacy concerns, it's too soon to tell. But it's inaccurate to say there’s "no regulation." We rate her statement False.

pomt-14329	"Will (HB2) threaten federal funding for public schools under Title IX? No, according to a federal court which has looked at a similar issue."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/28/pat-mccrory/gov-pat-mccrory-no-title-ix-threat-billions-federa/	One of the biggest questions in the ongoing debate over North Carolina’s new statewide law invalidating local LGBT protections is the status of $4.5 billion in federal education funding via Title IX. Title IX is a 1972 law that requires educational institutions to treat men and women equally. It has been used to punish schools for not taking sexual assault seriously, or for not offering women chances to play sports. The federal government has begun arguing in recent years that Title IX protections extend to transgender students, and a 2014 Department of Education memo formalized that position. "All students, including transgender students and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX," the memo reads. "Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes." Transgender people are those who don’t identify with the gender on their birth certificate. Even if they have one gender’s anatomy, they live life as the other gender and consider themselves to truly be that gender. One widely cited study in 2011 estimated that 0.3 percent of adults are transgender. North Carolina’s new law specifically prohibits schools from allowing transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. The law says schools may only permit a student to use the restrooms, locker rooms or other such facilities of the gender listed on the student’s birth certificate. The ACLU and some Democratic legislators say that contradiction between the state law and the federal guidance could cost billions. North Carolina is scheduled to receive an estimated $4.58 billion from the federal government in 2016 for education funding, which could be at risk with a Title IX violation. Those funds are largely for Pell Grants and student loans but also go toward K-12 programs for homeless students, rural schools, adult literacy and more. Republicans thoroughly disagree that the funding is at risk, and it was one of 18 points Gov. Pat McCrory made in a press release over Easter weekend which he dubbed "Facts vs. Myths." "Will this bill threaten federal funding for public schools under Title IX?" McCrory asked, only to then answer: "No, according to a federal court which has looked at a similar issue." McCrory has a point, but he leaves out a lot of detail. In eastern Virginia, a federal judge did rule that a school district wasn’t violating Title IX by refusing to let a transgender teen, who was born a female but identifies as male, use the boys bathroom. In that lawsuit, the student was represented by the ACLU and had statements of support from the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education. The Virginia case McCrory knows the case well; he was one of two governors (along with Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage) who submitted briefs on behalf of the school district in that case. A few other states weighed in with briefs from their attorneys general, but North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper – and McCrory’s Democratic opponent in November – declined to follow suit. The Virginia school district restricted students to bathrooms based on their "biological gender," which is similar to the "biological sex" wording used in North Carolina now. And in Virginia, the judge said that restriction is OK. So McCrory is right on that much. But he fails to mention that the case is currently under consideration by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal appeals court which also covers North Carolina. The ACLU has further asked that the 85-year-old judge in question be removed from the case, alleging he didn’t follow proper procedure and made statements indicating he doesn’t have a firm grasp of science. "Regardless of the outcome of this case, the public in general, and transgender people in particular, should have confidence the proceedings are not based on mistaken assumptions that continue to stigmatize transgender people, even if unintentionally," the ACLU wrote in asking the appeals court to remove the judge, Robert G. Doumar. The appeal states the judge refused expert witness testimony, allowed hearsay evidence on behalf of the school district but not on behalf of the student, refused testimony from the student, referred to the student as having a "mental disorder" – even after being informed that "The American Psychiatric Association has made clear that Gender Dysphoria should not be described as a ‘disorder’" – and went off on a tangent about federal policies concerning drug use, immigration and other unrelated issues. The appeals court heard the appeal in January but has not yet announced its decision. Other cases Last year a judge in Pennsylvania ruled against a transgender University of Pittsburgh student, who was expelled and criminally charged after repeatedly ignoring a bathroom ban. In that case, unlike in the Virginia case happening around the same time, the federal government did not weigh in. And then there’s the matter of other cases in which schools have settled with the federal government rather than going to court, like in the Virginia case. Schools in Illinois and California changed their policies after being threatened with the loss of funding by the federal government via Title IX. In Illinois, a transgender student who was born a male was allowed to change in the girls locker room, but behind a curtain. Previously the student had been using private, single-occupancy rooms to change – a provision that North Carolina’s law does allow for – but the federal authorities told Illinois officials that wasn’t good enough. In California, a school district agreed to let transgender students use the facilities of the gender they identify as, to amend its anti-discrimination policies to include "gender identity," to train administrators on how to accommodate transgender students and to give students "age-appropriate" lessons to discourage bullying and sexual harassment of transgender people. Our ruling Gov. Pat McCrory is correct that a federal judge said schools shouldn’t lose Title IX funding for not allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. But McCrory failed to mention that the case is still pending on appeal, and that there are questions about the judge’s impartiality. Furthermore, the threat of losing Title IX funds was real enough to convince authorities in Illinois and California to comply. In the end, it largely comes down to politics. The two judges who have ruled against transgender students are Republican political appointees. The federal departments of education and justice, which typically support transgender students, are run by Democratic political appointees. McCrory is right that a judge said there shouldn’t be a threat to Title IX funding in these types of situations. But that’s not to say there’s no threat at all – the official stance of the Obama administration, after all, has been enough of a threat to scare Illinois and California into making changes. Those are important pieces of context that are nowhere to be found in McCrory’s statement. We rate this statement Half True.	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-03-28T20:07:33	2016-03-26	['None']
pomt-12814	"Hundreds of illegal immigrants subject to detainers were released in the last week since the new sanctuary policy was adopted by the Travis County Sheriff's Office."	false	/texas/statements/2017/feb/10/dawn-buckingham/dawn-buckingham-incorrectly-says-hundreds-illegal-/	Physician Dawn Buckingham, Travis County’s newcomer in the Texas Senate, touted her co-authorship of a Senate-approved measure to ban so-called sanctuary city policies statewide by using her home county as an example. The Republican from Lakeway, elected in 2016 to represent Senate District 24, said in a Feb. 8, 2017, email blast: "I believe in a safe Travis County and a safe Texas, and actions recently taken by the Travis County Sheriff's Office have endangered our community and our state." Buckingham’s email continued: "Hundreds of illegal immigrants subject to detainers were released in the last week since the new sanctuary policy was adopted by the Travis County Sheriff's Office, and I am proud the Senate has acted quickly in response." Curious, we put Buckingham’s numbers to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Travis County's new policy The policy mentioned by Buckingham refers to Travis County’s new Democratic sheriff, Sally Hernandez, announcing in January 2017 that the office no longer would automatically honor federal "detainer" requests to hold individuals of interest to immigration authorities for 48 hours. "The public must be confident that local law enforcement is focused on local public safety, not on federal immigration enforcement," Hernandez said in an online video in which she also said that, previously, inmates handed off to immigration authorities were deported after posting bond and without resolving local criminal charges. Under the policy, Hernandez said, the office would honor detainer requests only if an inmate were charged with murder, sexual assault or human trafficking — or if federal agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant for a suspect. Otherwise, she said, inmates would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Buckingham's backup sought We asked Buckingham how she determined hundreds of immigrants were subsequently released. By email, her spokesman Keith Elkins provided a statement from Buckingham lacking information about her declared "hundreds." Rather, Buckingham said county residents need to know the sheriff’s office "has ignored hundreds of requests to detain inmates" in the country illegally. Latest count: 45 released individuals in eight days According to the sheriff’s office, we confirmed, 40 individuals were released on bail by the county the first few days after the sheriff’s policy took effect. When we followed up, a sheriff’s office spokeswoman, Kristen Dark, emailed us additional information indicating that through the day Buckingham made her claim, 45 individuals for whom detainer requests were denied by the office had been released--leaving others (more than 150 inmates by our calculation) still in custody, Dark said, for not making bond or because their charges had not yet been disposed. Much of this detail was public before Buckingham spoke. Citing information attributed to Dark, the Austin American-Statesman reported Feb. 2, 2017, that the new policy had "paved the way for the release of 37 suspected unauthorized immigrants" the day before. On the policy’s first day, the newspaper reported, the sheriff’s office declined requests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to place holds on 196 suspected undocumented immigrants--while the office honored 30 detainer requests. "Once the so-called ICE detainers were removed, 37 people were able to bail out Wednesday," the newspaper reported. "Had the detainers remained in place, inmates would still have been able to post bail, but they would have been released into ICE custody for possible deportation." A subsequent American-Statesman news story, posted online Feb. 6, 2017, said the county had denied 203 detainer requests and released 40 such individuals since the policy took effect. Meantime, the story said, immigration agents adjusting to the county’s policy had hustled to obtain arrest warrants for 42 booked individuals who also were suspected of living in the country without legal authorization. By the time the warrants were served, the story said, eight of the inmates had posted bail and been released, requiring agents to find and arrest the suspects again. Hernandez told the paper the others named in the warrants would be released to federal agents. The story quoted Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office, saying federal officials had stepped-up reviews of newly arrested Travis County residents so warrants could be sought for suspects -- avoiding reliance on the sheriff’s office to comply with detainer requests. The story further said immigration agents became aware that the suspects had been booked into jail by mining a federal law enforcement fingerprint database that’s routinely updated by county jail staff. Our ruling Buckingham said hundreds of illegal immigrants were released in the week after the sheriff’s policy was adopted. According to Travis County, 45 such individuals--not hundreds--were released in the eight days after the policy took effect. Additional releases seem likely due to the sheriff’s office not automatically honoring all detainer requests. But it also seems possible that stepped-up federal efforts to obtain warrants for jailed individuals will reduce the release rate. We rate Buckingham’s claim False.

pomt-12179	"Business spirit is the highest it's ever been, according to polls."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-business-spirit-highest-its-ever/	Right after swearing in his new chief of staff, President Donald Trump once again touted some of the economic accomplishments during his six months in office. This time, Trump included a metric he referred to as "business spirit." "Business spirit is the highest it's ever been, according to polls," Trump said. "If you look at the polls, (it’s) the highest it's ever been in the history of these polls." Never having heard of a measurement called "business spirit," we asked the White House for the name of the poll or polls in question. The press office did not get back to us. However, we found a few polls that seem to fit the bill, so we’ll use those to analyze Trump’s statement. Business Roundtable’s CEO Economic Outlook The Business Roundtable, a group of corporate CEOs, has released a CEO Economic Outlook Survey on a quarterly basis since the fourth quarter of 2002. The survey is "designed to provide a picture of the future direction of the U.S. economy by asking CEOs to report their company’s sales expectations and plans for capex spending and hiring in the next six months," according to the group. Here’s the historical data: The index’s current level is reasonably high at 93.9. But the survey has shown a higher rating in 16 earlier quarters, or about 29 percent of the quarters since the survey began. So using this data, it isn’t accurate to say that the business outlook is "higher than it’s ever been." NFIB’s Index of Small Business Optimism The National Federation of Independent Business has been releasing its index of small-business optimism on a monthly basis since 1986. The survey questions selected small business owners who belong to the organization. The current index level is 103.6. Here’s the data since 1986: The chart shows that while the index is relatively high at the moment, it was higher for periods in 2004 and 2005. It has also fallen since Trump took office. It peaked at 105.9 in January 2017, right as Trump was taking office and has fallen consistently. The survey data, the group said, indicates that "economic growth in the first half of this year will be about the same as we have experienced for the past three or four years, no real progress. There isn’t much euphoria in the outlook for the second half of the year." Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index The Institute for Supply Management surveys purchasing executives at some 300 companies on a monthly basis. The number for June was 57.8, which was up 2.9 points since May. However, you don’t have to look too far in the past for a number higher than June’s -- in August 2014, the measurement registered 57.9 percent. YPO Global Pulse YPO is an organization of 24,000 CEOs that publishes studies of business confidence around the world. Here is the data for its survey of the United States since 2009: This is probably the strongest piece of evidence for Trump’s assertion, as the current level is essentially the highest the survey has found since 2009. However, today’s level is not unprecedented -- it hit essentially the same level three times under President Barack Obama. These four surveys all broadly fit the category of business surveys. There’s another kind of survey, as well -- consumer confidence surveys, which are asked of ordinary Americans rather than business owners. These don’t fit Trump’s description, but it’s worth taking a look. They describe how ordinary Americans feel about the economy. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index is probably the most widely tracked study of consumer confidence, published either monthly or quarterly since 1967. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The current level of 121.1 is relatively high, but it was exceeded for almost all of the stretch between May 1997 and November 2000, when Bill Clinton was president, as well as a stretch between 1967 and 1969, when Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were president. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is similar in format to the board’s consumer confidence index and its results are similar. Here is the data going back to 1978. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Finally, the polling firm Gallup surveys approximately 1,500 adults nationally to come up with its Economic Confidence Index. Confidence did peak under Trump in this survey, but as with other measurements, it has fallen during his time in office. "Though Americans remain optimistic about the state of the economy, this sentiment is not as strong as it was in the weeks just before and after Donald Trump's presidential inauguration," Gallup wrote July 25. In addition to pointing out the difference between business confidence and consumer confidence, we should make clear that high levels of confidence are not the same thing as high levels of economic activity. Surveys that measure either business or consumer confidence measure something intangible -- how someone feels and what they think they will do in the future. It’s not necessarily dependent on past or current performance, and confidence levels can go up or down untethered to actual economic results. Our ruling Trump said, "Business spirit is the highest it's ever been, according to polls." Current levels of business confidence, as measured by regular surveys of executives, are relatively high at the moment, but they are not the highest ever -- and in several that are taken on a monthly basis, they have fallen since Trump took office. The statement is a significant exaggeration, so we rate it Mostly False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-07-31T17:38:08	2017-07-31	['None']
pomt-02781	Passing a federal firearms "background check through the NICS database . . . typically takes 90 seconds."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/08/james-langevin/us-rep-james-langevin-says-it-takes-just-90-second/	Imagine contacting the federal government and getting what you need in 90 seconds. U.S. Rep. James Langevin says that's how long it takes to get a federal background check if you're seeking to buy a firearm. The statement comes in a Dec. 3 news release, issued jointly with Rep. David Cicilline, calling for "a more effective background check process" that includes mental health records that Rhode Island, under law, is prevented from giving to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). (A General Assembly commission is exploring whether to modify the law.) Langevin reports, "The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires an individual to pass a background check through the NICS database before purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, a process that typically takes 90 seconds." Why is the 90 seconds important to the gun control issue? Langevin spokeswoman Meg Fraser said it shows that "running a background check is generally a quick process, and adding additional records to the system would not result in a significant change or inconvenience to the customer." There are days when we can't get a cup of coffee at Starbucks in 90 seconds, so we wondered if the background check process is really that quick. We turned to people who use the system regularly. Robert Carney, owner of Post Road Guns on Plainfield Pike, in Cranston, said it's true that it usually takes 90 seconds or less for the NICS to search its database and determine whether a customer is eligible to purchase a weapon. And he does it with a phone call, not with a computer. The same is true for Adam Dacko, of Foster Bear Arms & Trading Post, in Foster. He estimated that 75 percent to 90 percent of the checks are completed within 45 seconds. Delays may occur if someone has a common name and doesn’t provide a Social Security number, which is optional. "It takes longer for me to read off the form than it does for me to get a response," he said. Which brings up another point: That's not the whole process. Carney showed us Form 4473 from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which must be filled out first. It requires basic information such as height, weight and gender, along with questions about whether the would-be buyer is under indictment, has been convicted of a felony, has received a dishonorable discharge from the military, is addicted to any controlled substance, or is subject to a restraining order for harassing, stalking or threatening a child, "intimate partner or the child of an intimate partner." It took us just under three minutes to fill out the form's 27 questions and sign it. The seller must then confirm the buyer's identification, contact the NICS system, recite all the information on the form over the phone to an operator (or type it into the computer), and take down the confirmation information supplied through the NICS system. That would take a few more minutes. Gun dealer Robert Swinehart of Arquebus Co., in West Warwick, said the whole process typically takes about five minutes. Fraser then sent us a link to an FBI fact sheet about the NICS system, which claims that a "response is typically provided within 30 seconds." Swinehart said 30 seconds is typical for him when the buyer has a clean record. Although the local firearms dealers are required to keep the form on file, federal authorities are required to delete the personal details received during each NICS inquiry once the sale is approved. If a buyer wants to purchase another gun the next day, the would-be purchaser has to go through the process all over again. In addition to the federal check, local police are required to run a check as well, which can take a few days. It's all part of the state's seven-day waiting period. Our ruling James Langevin said in a news release that passing a federal firearms "background check through the NICS database . . . typically takes 90 seconds." Gun dealers tell us the federal process is, in fact, usually very quick, barring some ambiguity with a person's record. However, some readers might take Langevin's statement to mean that the whole process takes 90 seconds. It actually requires a few minutes for the customer to fill out the paperwork and the dealer to transmit the information to the NICS system. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07355	Says Milwaukee County spent over $170,000 in salaries in 2010 for employees to "participate in union activities such as collective bargaining."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-milwaukee-county-p/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker promoted his budget-repair bill in February 2011 by saying it would balance the state budget and "give government the tools to deal with this and future budget crises." One tool was designed to sharply curtail the collective bargaining powers of most state and local government employees, and eliminate collective bargaining altogether for others. It was that part of the Republican governor’s bill that led Democratic state senators to hotfoot it to Illinois and protesters to stage daily demonstrations in Madison. Walker issued a number of statements touting the bill, including two entitled "Collective bargaining is a fiscal issue." The second statement, issued Feb. 22, 2011, made this claim: "In Milwaukee County alone, because the union collectively bargained for paid time off, 14 employees receive salary and benefits for doing union business. Of the 14, three are on full-time release for union business. Milwaukee County spent over $170,000 in salary alone for these employees to only participate in union activities such as collective bargaining." Another Walker news release repeated the claim the next day and added: "The budget-repair bill reforms would help counties, like Milwaukee County, save on these costs." The dollar sign in Walker’s claim made us wonder: Did Milwaukee County pay employees over $170,000 not to do work for the county, but for their unions? Walker’s claim was made more than two months ago, but collective bargaining remains at the top of the state’s political agenda. The issue is part of efforts to recall state senators from office. And on June 6, 2011, the state Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing about whether it should be the court to consider a legal challenge to Walker’s measure. We asked the governor’s office what the $170,000 referred to, and were told Milwaukee County spent more than that amount in 2010 on salaries for county employees for doing union work. As support, the governor’s office forwarded a report it received from Milwaukee County payroll manager Sue Drummond the day before it issued the news release that made the $170,000 claim. The report listed county employees who received pay in 2010 for time they spent carrying out union duties. For several decades, union contracts agreed upon by Milwaukee County provide for certain employees to be paid when they are doing union activities. The activities can include attending County Board meetings, representing a worker in a disciplinary hearing and participating in contract talks, among other things. In this item, we’re not weighing in on the merits of the practice; we’re checking the accuracy of Walker’s claim on the cost to Milwaukee County. We’ll also check a few other places, including the city of Milwaukee and the state, for some added context. The report forwarded to us by the governor’s office did not tally how much in salaries the county paid to employees doing union work. But an analysis provided by the governor’s office said the county in 2010 paid $170,593 in salaries to county employees for doing union work. We then asked the county directly to provide figures. A report issued to us May 6, 2011 from county controller Scott Manske showed that in 2010: The county spent $180,385 in salaries, plus $82,208 in benefits, on employees for doing union business. Nearly two-thirds of the salaries -- $117,854 -- were paid to the presidents of three AFSCME (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees) unions who worked full-time on union business and did no work for the county. They included David Eisner, president of the union that represents Department of Human Services workers; Ronnie Hart and Beth Werve, who split time as president of the union that represents administrative and clerical employees; and Kurt Zunker, president of the union that represents public works, parks, airport and zoo employees. Nearly 60 other employees continued to receive their full pay even when they took time away from their county jobs periodically to do union activities. Zunker, who heads Milwaukee County’s largest union with some 1,100 members, said the system for paying some county employees to do union work is a benefit county employees have earned as part of the give-and-take that occurs in bargaining contracts with the county. Chris Pegelow, a former Milwaukee County employee who served as president of the same union, said putting county employees in union positions full time arguably saves the county money and time in settling workplace disputes that might otherwise escalate into legal cases. Because they are full-time union presidents, those employees are more accessible to county officials and more knowledgeable about workplace issues, he said. The system is also less disruptive than if the union presidents worked full-time in county positions and had to be released from those duties each time a workplace issue arose, he said. The City of Milwaukee spent more than the county in 2010 on employees doing union work. The city spent $291,253 on salaries and $215,419 in benefits for seven employees who hold full-time union positions, said city labor relations officer Joe Alvarado. The figures, which are set by contract between the city and the unions, will be the same for 2011, he said. The city pays full benefits to the president, vice president and secretary/treasurer of the police union, plus half the salary of the vice president and secretary/treasurer, Alvarado said. For the other four employees who do union work full-time, the city pays the full salary and benefits, Alvarado said The employees include the heads of the unions that represent firefighters, sanitation workers, the Department of Public Works and other departments, and truck drivers and service equipment workers. Alvarado said the system has been in place since the Milwaukee Police Association negotiated for one such position some 40 years ago. Meanwhile, the state does not pay any employees to do only union work, said Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration. But it does allow employees to conduct union activities at various times while they’re on the clock. In 2010, according to a summary provided by Vigue, employees representing 16 unions spent 30,783 work hours on union activities. Those hours, which Vigue said were logged by 466 employees, amounted to $705,731 in salaries, according to the summary. It remains to be seen how many government employees would continue to be paid for doing union business if Walker’s bill, which was adopted into law by the Legislature, survives court challenges. Unions representing police officers, firefighters and state troopers could continue to collectively bargain for such arrangements, since they are exempted from Walker’s bill. However, unions representing other public employees would be allowed to bargain only for base pay. That means it would be up to the government to decide whether to continue to pay some employees for doing union work, said Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie. Let’s wrap up. Gov. Walker said Milwaukee County spent more than $170,000 in 2010 on salaries for employees doing union activities. The actual tally, according to the county -- for three union presidents who did union work full-time and other employees who did occasional union work -- was $180,385.

pomt-11840	Says Glenn Grothman "is the single-most partisan member of the House."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/08/dan-kohl/wisconsins-glenn-grothman-his-rival-claims-most-pa/	In 21 years as a state lawmaker, Republican U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman was known for making provocative comments, such as: Homosexuality should not be discussed in sex education classes and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday is "an insult" to taxpayers. Grothman’s remarks have gotten less attention since he was elected in 2014 to a House seat in east-central Wisconsin that has been safely Republican for decades. So, it was a surprise when Grothman, who is seeking a third House term in 2018, said he is facing the toughest race of his political career against Democrat Dan Kohl. Kohl himself isn’t well known, though he is the nephew of multimillionaire and former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis. A mantra of Kohl’s campaign -- that Grothman "is the single-most partisan member of the House" -- is something we want to check. The charge (sometimes with the word Congress instead of House) appeared as recently as Nov. 7, 2017 on Kohl’s campaign Facebook page. And it is one he has made repeatedly, including on TV, on Twitter, in a campaign video and in his campaign announcement. As we’ll see, there’s a solid source to back up the claim. But its data is nearly a year old and it acknowledges it uses only one way to measure partisanship. One ranking The latest Bipartisan Index ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan House member, ahead of only Kansas Republican Tim Huelskamp. Kohl argues that Grothman is currently the most-partisan because Huelskamp, who lost his run for re-election in 2016, is no longer in the House. But the rankings are for the 114th Congress, which covers Grothman’s first two-year term in the House (2015-’16). They don’t take into account any activity since 2016, including any new member now in a first term. The rankings are done by the Lugar Center, a think tank formed by Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican who served in the U.S. Senate from 1977 to 2013; and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. The rankings have been reported on by Politico, The Hill, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Roll Call and other media that cover Congress. The index measures bipartisanship in two ways -- the frequency with which members of Congress sponsor bills that include at least one co-sponsor from the opposing party and co-sponsor bills introduced by members of the opposing party. As the Journal Sentinel has reported, it’s just one of many ways to define bipartisanship, but it’s a concrete, quantifiable measure of the effort members make at the front end of the legislative process to work across party lines. According to the Bipartisan Index, during the 2015-’16 session, Grothman sponsored eight qualifying bills, none of which gained a single Democrat co-sponsor; and co-sponsored 276 qualifying bills, only nine of which were introduced by a Democrat. Other measures Grothman’s House office noted that GovTrack.us, which tracks Congress, also does bipartisanship rankings. We found two for House members for the 2015-’16 session, though each is less comprehensive than the Bipartisan Index. One had the same finding as the Bipartisan Index -- that Grothman did not introduce any bill that had a Democratic cosponsor. For the percentage of bills cosponsored by each legislator that were introduced by a member of the other party, Grothman ranked fifth from the bottom. Grothman's office also cited to us a number of Grothman’s bipartisan actions, all during 2017, including: Grothman expressing disagreement with fellow Republicans over legislation; working with U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, on legislation for refinancing student loans; and co-sponsoring a GOP-sponsored bill, also supported by Democrats, to legalize hemp. Our rating Kohl says Grothman "is the single-most partisan member of the House." One widely noted index ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan member during the 2015-’16 congressional session, above only a member who is no longer in the House. That arguably makes Grothman the most-partisan currently. But the index is only one way of defining partisanship, and it doesn’t account for any House member activity after 2016. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Dan Kohl	None	None	None	2017-11-08T05:00:00	2017-11-07	['None']
pomt-06160	Says there have been no cases of wolves killing people in Rocky Mountain states.	true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/16/oregon-department-fish-and-wildlife/department-fish-and-wildlife-says-there-have-been-/	The story of OR-7, the young gray wolf who has settled in southwest Oregon after a 750-mile trek, has captured headlines around the world. He’s also reignited local debates about the place for wolves in rural communities, and their potential threat to people and livestock. In a recent article in The Oregonian, Michelle Dennehy, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, spoke some about those risks. "Wolves have attacked and killed people in Canada and Alaska," Dennehy told The Oregonian. "It is extremely rare and has never happened in the Rocky Mountain states, but we advise people to keep your distance from wolves and any wild animals." Oregon is home to an estimated 24 wolves, a small population. But a 2010 reportby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountain population (which includes Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and the eastern one-third of Washington and Oregon) at more than 1,650. This got us wondering whether it could be true that there have been no documented cases of run-ins with wolves in that fairly large area. Plus, we’re always looking for a change of pace. We started where we always start: the source. Dennehy pointed us to a 2002 report from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research called "The fear of wolves: A review of wolf attacks on humans." Because "the vast majority" of global wolf research happens in North America, the report says, wolf attacks in Canada and the U.S. have been extremely well documented. That documentation -- and the fact that attacks are so rare -- allowed the authors to detail every attack in the past century. All told, the study’s authors found 18 wolf attacks in North America -- 12 in Canada and six in the U.S. Of the attacks in the U.S., four occurred in Alaska (as did an unspecified number of small incidents along a road where truckers had taken to feeding the wolves) and two in Minnesota, in which the victims weren’t injured. Two of the attacks in Alaska left the victim dead of rabies. Both of those happened in the 1940s. Dennehy also sent us a news clip from a paper up in Saskatchewan that detailed the 2005 deathof a young Ontario student who was on a walk near a Saskatchewan mining camp when he was attacked and killed. A sad story to be sure, but one that happened a ways away from the Rocky Mountains. We try to be thorough, so we also placed a call to the International Wolf Center, an organization that tries to advance the survival of wolves through education. We spoke to Jess Edberg, who is based in Ely, Minnesota. Minnesota has the most robust wolf population outside of Alaska. "Overall, in North America and around the world, a wolf attack on humans is very rare," Edberg said. "In the lower 48, we haven't had any attacks on humans." She added that many of the attacks that do occur often involve sick animals or animals who had been fed or allowed to become accustomed to humans. Edberg did point out the Alaska Department of Fish and Game had recently concluded that a woman found dead in 2010 on the Alaska Peninsula was killed by wolves. Finally, she sent us looking for two studies on wolves. One report, which shared an author with the first Norwegian report, looked at Scandinaviaand found that over the past 300 years, 94 people have been killed by wolves. All of those cases, the report found, were before 1882 and most were children under the age of 12. The second, more pertinent report, done in 2002, by Mark E McNay for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game looked at wolf attacks in Alaska and Canada and found that "despite (a) large and widely distributed wolf population, no human deaths have been attributed to wild, healthy wolves since at least 1900, and biting incidents or bluff charges are rare enough to warrant publication in scientific journals." Of course, that report was published before the two deaths we mentioned above. Still, the reports support Dennehy and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. There’s no evidence that a wolf has attacked a human in the Rocky Mountain states, let alone killed one. We rate this claim True. Want to comment on the ruling?

pomt-02176	40 percent of illegal immigrants "had a visa and then became illegal," mostly because "they changed jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/29/rand-paul/big-reason-illegal-immigrants-become-illegal-they-/	Freshman U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is rated a first-tier Republican presidential contender for 2016, made a trip to heavily Democratic Chicago and Milwaukee to advocate for private school vouchers and to reach out to low-income and Latino residents. Along the way, he made an interesting claim about how many illegal immigrants actually entered the United States legally. On April 23, 2014, Paul visited St. Anthony School, a voucher school touted as the largest K3-12 Catholic school in the country and the largest Latino education institution in Milwaukee. During an exchange with reporters, the co-founder of the Senate tea party caucus was asked whether his 2013 vote against immigration reform sent a "conflicting message to you being pro-Latino." The bill had passed the Senate, winning votes from all 52 Democrats plus 14 Republicans and two independents, but was never taken up by the GOP-controlled House. It would have allowed the some 11 million immigrants without documents to get permission to live and work in the country legally, while also providing a pathway to citizenship and taking steps to improve border security. Paul told the reporter he supports immigration reform, but that one reason he voted against the bill is it would have too strictly limited the number of people who could enter the United States with work visas. He continued by saying: "One of the fundamental problems in our immigration system currently -- of the 11 million who are here, 40 percent had a visa and then became illegal. The primary reason they become illegal is that they were picking crops for $9 an hour and they saw a sign for $14 an hour doing construction work. They changed jobs." Is Paul right? Understanding immigration A foreign citizen seeking to immigrate generally must be sponsored by a U.S. citizen or prospective employer, and have an approved petition before applying for an immigrant visa. Some people, of course, cross the border into the United States illegally. And others -- tourists, students or temporary workers, for example -- enter legally on non-immigrant temporary visas, but then never leave. A word here on terminology. According to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends Project, a leading authority on immigration, "unauthorized immigrants" are all foreign-born non-citizens residing in the country who are not "legal immigrants." These definitions reflect standard usage by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and academic researchers. The vast majority of unauthorized immigrants entered the country without valid documents or arrived with valid visas but stayed past their visa expiration date or otherwise violated the terms of their admission. The latest estimates by Pew and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security put the number of unauthorized immigrants at at least 11.5 million. That's more than triple the 3.5 million in 1990, but down from the peak of 12.2 million in 2007, according to Pew. The number remains relatively high even though there were 1.58 million deportations under President Barack Obama from 2009 through 2012, a faster pace than the 2.01 million deportations done during President George W. Bush’s two terms (2001-2008). Now let’s get back to Paul’s claim on how many unauthorized immigrants entered the country legally but became illegal because they changed jobs. Paul's evidence Asked for evidence to back Paul's claim, a spokesman cited an April 2013 Wall Street Journal news article. It said 40 percent of the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States were foreigners who arrived legally, but overstayed their visas. So, that gives some support to the 40 percent part of Paul’s claim, but the article did not address how many of those immigrants became illegal because they changed jobs. Other evidence PolitiFact Texas in 2013 and PolitiFact National in 2010 rated statements by two congressmen that about 40 percent of illegal immigrants became illegal because they overstayed their visas. Our colleagues reported on a 2006 study by Pew, which they cited as the latest available. It estimated that out of 11.5 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in 2006, between 33 percent and 50 percent were "visa overstayers." The report split the difference by proposing a figure of 45 percent. Our colleagues rated both 40 percent statements Mostly True, but pointed out that not only were the figures estimates, they were several years old, even though they were the latest available. However, we could find no evidence -- and Paul didn’t provide any -- to show that the main reason the 40 percent of unauthorized immigrants became illegal was that they changed jobs. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, is not aware of any estimates on how many undocumented U.S. immigrants became illegal because of a job change, a spokeswoman told us. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration laws, said job change "is certainly not the primary reason" for so-called visa overstays. Vaughan said the vast majority of visa overstays are people who enter the United States with a tourist visa and then stay. She noted that millions of people each year get tourist visas while only tens of thousands are permitted temporary work visas. As a footnote, regarding the scenario Paul described: Vaughan said it would be illegal for a person admitted to the United States on a temporary visa for agricultural work to then take a job in a different industry and remain in the country without making the proper immigrant application and getting it approved. The government allots temporary work visas in areas such as agriculture where laborers are needed, but not with the idea that that person can then take any job and remain in the country, she said. Our rating Paul said 40 percent of illegal immigrants "had a visa and then became illegal," mostly because "they changed jobs." The best estimates are that roughly 40 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the country legally but became illegal when they overstayed their temporary visa. There is not evidence, however, to indicate that most of those people became illegal simply because they changed jobs. We rate Paul's statement Half True.

Bob McDonnell said there is a pox on both political parties for causing the federal government’s partial shutdown. But he insisted the biggest welts are on the backs of President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate. McDonnell, a Republican, noted that 49 states require the passage of balanced budgets each year. That includes Virginia. "We’re incredulous, at the state level, it’s been four and a half years since the United States Senate has passed a budget, a spending blueprint for America," McDonnell said. "You know, no business, no state, no local government, no church, no synagogue, or a family could ever run like that." Later in the interview, McDonnell repeated that the Senate has not passed a budget in 4-1/2 years. We asked for asked for elaboration and Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, sent us a PolitiFact Tennessee article from September 2012. It gave Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn, a True rating for saying the Senate has failed to pass a budget in "more than three years." That Truth-O-Meter item said Senate hadn’t passed a budget since April 29, 2009. But things have changed. The Senate, on March 23 this year, passed a $3.7 trillion budget on a 50-49 vote that maintained entitlements -- such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare -- and discretionary domestic programs. It differed from a $3.5 trillion House budget, passed three days earlier, that significantly cut entitlement programs and deficits over the coming decade. Efforts to send the competing budgets to a conference committee have been unsuccessful, however. A group of Tea Party senators has blocked motions -- which need unanimous consent -- to advance the Senate’s spending plan. They have insisted on assurances that the budget negotiations would not lead to higher taxes and voiced concern that a conference committee could create momentum for procedures that thwart filibusters against increasing the nation's debt limit. Our ruling McDonnell said the U.S. Senate hasn’t passed a budget in four and a half years. His information is out of date. The Senate passed a budget in March. A group of Republican senators has blocked efforts to begin budget negotiations with the House. What a difference a year makes for this claim. McDonnell’s statement is False.

Australia's levy is similar in its structure and rate to some European levies but different from most of them in its primary aim. Due to the impact of the GFC on the European banking system, a dominant theme of the European levies is creating greater stability in the banking sector by reducing debt and discouraging risky lending practices. Many governments specify that the revenue raised is to be used to pay back GFC bailout loans, and some put the revenue into dedicated funds to be used as a buffer should another crisis occur. In contrast, Australia's levy is designed primarily to raise revenue for budget repair, as well as helping create greater industry competition and balance sheet resilience.

pomt-08708	After Ronald Reagan cut taxes in 1981 the U.S. enjoyed "exponential growth."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/05/john-loughlin/loughlin-says-reagans-1981-tax-cuts-led-exponentia/	John Loughlin, who is running in the Republican primary in the 1st Congressional District, is sounding a bipartisan theme in his call for cutting taxes as a solution to our economic problems. He tells viewers in his new web ad "What we need to do is what John F. Kennedy did in 1961, which is cut taxes. What we need to do is what Ronald Reagan did in 1981, and cut taxes and enjoy exponential growth." Loughlin is echoing a popular Republican theme: If you want to grow the economy, cut taxes. The favorite example is Reagan, who was a big proponent of cutting taxes and reducing government spending. In his ad, Loughlin's unstated implication is that Reagan cut taxes and the economy grew explosively as a result. But is it really that simple? First, Reagan alone didn't cut taxes. He did it in conjunction with Congress. Having said that, let's look at the Reagan era of taxation. There's no debate that Reagan dramatically reduced taxes in 1981, his first year in office. That $38-billion cut would equal $90 billion in today's dollars. At the time, it represented 1.91 percent of the gross domestic product, which is the total value of goods and services produced in the United States during a given year. But the following year, Reagan raised taxes dramatically and other increases followed. The 1982 hike alone, which applied to corporations and individuals, increased taxes by about $17 billion, according to a 2006 U.S. Treasury report. The increase represented 0.8 percent of the GDP. That's why it is sometimes billed as the largest peacetime tax increase in American history. That same year he also raised the gasoline tax. In 1983, Reagan hiked taxes again. This time it was the passage of the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which increased payroll taxes to provide long-term funding for Medicare and Social Security. According to liberal economist Paul Krugman, in a June 8, 2004, commentary in The New York Times, "this tax increase more than undid any gains from Mr. Reagan's income tax cuts" for many middle- and low-income families. Reagan also significantly increased taxes through the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, the Tax Reform of 1986 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. We asked Loughlin why he mentioned only Reagan's tax cut and not the subsequent increases. He said Reagan's 1984 increase, for example, "was to combat a budget deficit and it was also because of a fear of inflation in 1984." "When I make the statement it was not to provide an economics lesson, but it was to illustrate that when tax rates are cut, specifically marginal tax rates and business tax rates, historically the economy experiences growth," he said. "If you argue that that's what we need to do right now, grow the economy, then certainly that's a lesson from the past that has some relevance today." Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science and public policy at Brown University, said Reagan's tax policies and their impacts were complicated. "He definitely raised taxes. He had to. But they were far more targeted taxes" after the big 1981 cut, she said. "When they talk about taxes, they also talk about the Medicare premium. They talk about the Social Security contribution and the income limit for Social Security contributions. All of those things would be considered taxes." Even when Reagan lowered the tax rate again in 1986, it didn't help the middle class, she said. "In '81 they kept deductions for things like credit card interest and student loan interest, so if your parents paid your student loan they could take the deduction. In '86 they got rid of all that," said Schiller. "So their overall tax load went up. He didn't yank up the tax rates by a third. He just took away a lot of the really good deductions for them, which ended up really raising the taxes [for] a lot of people who had benefited from the [1981] cuts." The other question is, did the original tax cut spark "exponential growth," as Loughlin contended. Taken literally, "exponential" refers to growth at an ever-increasing rate, as when something doubles, then triples, then quadruples. The economy during the Reagan years did no such thing. When we talked to Loughlin about that part of his statement, he said: "We experienced additional growth after Ronald Reagan cut taxes and that might be a bit of hyperbole to say 'exponentially.'" In fact, immediately after the 1981 cuts, the country went into a recession. The GDP dropped by nearly 2 percent. The unemployment rate jumped more than two full percentage points, spiking to 9.7 percent. Then things got better. The GDP rose 4.5 percent in 1983 and 7.2 percent in 1984. Those are substantial jumps. The increases returned to a fairly typical 3 percent and 4 percent during the rest of his tenure. Unemployment barely declined in 1983, but then began a steady fall to 5.3 percent in 1989, when Reagan left office. In the end, it all boils down to a question of timing. Conservatives argue that the economic downturn after Reagan's 1981 tax cut wasn't his fault. For example, the Heritage Foundation said the steep recession was caused by tightening the money supply and attempting to rein in the inflation. Liberals argue that reversing the tax cuts restored confidence in the economy and spurred economic growth. Loughlin, like other conservatives, argue that the cuts themselves sparked the growth, and it simply took time for the benefits to appear. We asked Edinaldo Tebaldi, an assistant professor of economics at Bryant University, about the timing. He said it takes one to three years "to fully see the benefits of tax cuts." He said candidates may proclaim that if you cut taxes it will spark economic growth, but "it's not that simple. The facts would not support that claim. Lower taxes are a good thing, but you need a good environment for business." That can mean better regulations that work without being onerous. In addition, "we need to cut how much the government spends on a regular basis." (Reagan had little success in his avowed quest to cut federal spending. Although Republicans controlled the Senate for the first six of his eight years, the Democrats held the House of Representatives.) Schiller made similar points: "Lots of things helped the economy. Fiscal policy, lowering interest rates, certainly the tax cuts, the rhetoric of fiscal restraint, and investing in defense spending will help the economy," she said. "So there's a lot of things that went up and went down under Reagan." We'll let the economists and the partisan pundits wrangle over the impact and timing of tax changes and cycles of economic growth. In the end, Loughlin is correct that Reagan cut taxes in 1981. Yet he omits the important fact that the 40th president subsequently approved substantial increases, an omission we consider significant. As for exponential growth after the Reagan tax cut, the candidate acknowledges that that's an exaggeration, although he shares the conviction of many others that the 1981 cut played a key role in economic growth in the 1980s. In an economy as complex as ours, cause and effect statements like Loughlin's are great for a campaign ad, but they make the Truth-O-Meter shudder. So we'll give the candidate a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15302	Says Bill and Hillary Clinton attended Donald Trump's last wedding.	true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/21/carlos-curbelo/clintons-really-did-attend-donald-trumps-2005-wedd/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s controversial campaign could just be a ruse to sabotage the GOP, said U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. After all, the billionaire is so friendly with Hillary Clinton, Trump invited her to his nuptials. "I think there's a small possibility that this gentleman is a phantom candidate," Curbelo told Miami radio host Roberto Rodríguez Tejera on July 10, 2015. "Mr. Trump has a close friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton. They were at his last wedding. He has contributed to the Clintons' foundation. He has contributed to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaigns. All of this is very suspicious." We’re not going to rule on whether Trump and the Clintons are friends -- as the old saying goes, "If you want a friend in politics, get a dog!" -- but we did want to find out if Curbelo had his wedding anecdote right. The short answer is, yes, the Clintons did attend Trump’s 2005 wedding to Melania Knauss. Well, current Democratic presidential candidate Hillary was at the ceremony. Former President Bill didn’t show up until the reception. Because who wouldn’t want to participate in that Electric Slide lineup? It was the then-58-year-old Trump’s third wedding. Before he got hitched to Slovenian former model Knauss, who was 34 at the time, he had been married first to Ivana Trump and then Marla Maples. Clinton had a front-pew seat at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach for the wedding on Jan. 22, 2005. People magazine said that the 450-person guest list included former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and media and entertainment personalities like Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Simon Cowell, Regis Philbin, Kelly Ripa, Star Jones and Barbara Walters. The fun really started after the ceremony in the ballrom at Trump’s own Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach. Bill Clinton showed up in time for a party that included performances by Billy Joel, Paul Anka and Tony Bennett. The reception also featured a 200-pound, 5-foot-tall wedding cake. As for whether Trump contributed to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton’s senate campaigns, Trump has admitted as much. "I’m a businessman, I contribute to everybody," Trump told Fox & Friends on July 15. (PunditFact has found to be the case.) "That’s part of the problem with the system. I contribute to everybody. When I need Hillary, she was there. If I say go to my wedding, they go to my wedding. I contribute to everybody and you know what, that’s part of the problem with our system." Trump told the U.K.’s Daily Mail in May that he had never gotten any favors for his donations to the Clintons, "but they do kiss my ass" to get that money. He also has called Hillary Clinton "the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States."

pomt-00648	"You can be an NFL player with murder charges and not be suspended."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/18/donald-trump/trump-tees-tom-bradys-suspension-says-players-murd/	Donald Trump is on Team Tom. The billionaire who loves to dabble in politics recently tweeted his reaction to the NFL’s decision to suspend New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady four games over his alleged role in "Deflategate." The league punished Brady, who is appealing his suspension, after an independent report found it was "more probable than not" that Brady knew about the Patriots staffers who released air from game balls after the referees’ inspection. He tweeted, "You can be an @nfl player with murder charges and not be suspended. Yet with NO EVIDENCE, @nfl targeted Tom Brady. B.S.!" As referees of factual claims, we wondered about Trump’s statement. We don’t know specifically who Trump was thinking about — his press team didn’t respond to us — but we were unable to find a situation that precisely supports his claim. The closest parallel is the case of former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis. Lewis was indeed arrested on murder charges, and he was not suspended by the NFL. But there’s more to the story as to why. Lewis was arrested on charges of murder and aggravated assault in the Jan. 31, 2000, stabbing deaths of two men after a Super Bowl party in Atlanta. Prosecutors worked out a deal with Lewis where the murder charges would be dropped if he testified against two friends who were with him that night. (They were acquitted.) Lewis’ arrest and plea all took place during the 2000 offseason, so there were no games for which he could have been suspended. Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor obstruction of justice charge in June 2000. After Lewis’ plea, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Lewis would not be suspended. ''It's the courts who have the primary responsibility in this case,'' Tagliabue said in a July 2000 conference call with reporters, according to the New York Times. ''We're not a substitute for the courts.'' The NFL put Lewis on probation for a year and fined him $250,000, which Lewis called disappointing. More recent cases contradict Trump’s claim. The New England Patriots’ Aaron Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder in the June 2013 death of Odin Lloyd. When Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder on June 26, 2013, the Patriots didn’t suspend him — they cut him. Before Hernandez, Rae Carruth was the only active NFL player to be convicted of a murder-related charge. The Carolina Panthers wide receiver was arrested for first-degree murder in the death of his pregnant girlfriend, who was killed in a drive-by shooting while sitting in her car on November 1999. (The unborn child survived.) Carruth was accused of setting up the shooting. He was acquitted of the first-degree murder charge but was found guilty of murder conspiracy, among other charges. He is in prison. After Carruth’s arrest, the Panthers waived him and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. Vehicular homicides Other NFL players have faced charges for killing people due to reckless driving. Those crimes came with suspensions or worse. In 2003, Dallas Cowboys cornerback Dwayne Goodrich hit three men on a Dallas interstate with his BMW, killing two and shattering the other’s left leg. The men were trying to save a man from a burning car. Goodrich was convicted of criminally negligent homicide with a deadly weapon and failure to stop and render aid, and he spent six years in prison. The Cowboys released him upon his arrest. Donte Stallworth, formerly of the Cleveland Browns, was suspended without pay for the 2009 season after he hit and killed a man, Mario Reyes, with his Bentley in Miami. His blood-alcohol content was .126, more than three times Florida’s legal limit. He pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter, bounced around a few NFL teams after the Browns cut him, and eventually landed a reporting internship at the Huffington Post. In 1998, St. Louis Rams player Leonard Little killed a woman after drinking and driving, hitting her car with his SUV. The team put Little on paid leave. After he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, the league placed Little on a suspension of eight regular season games. Other examples Some players were involved in deaths, even if they were not charged with murder. In July 1995, Seattle Seahawks receiver Brian Blades shot and killed his cousin, Charles, and was charged with manslaughter, which in Florida is a second-degree felony applied when a killing occurs because of negligence or without a legal reason. Blades said the shooting was accidental, and went on to play all 16 games in the 1995 season. A jury initially convicted Blades of manslaughter in June 1996, but the verdict was overturned a week later by a Florida judge. During the same month of Hernandez’s high-profile arrest in June 2013, Cleveland Browns rookie Ausar Walcott punched a man in the head outside of a New Jersey gentleman’s club, and the man suffered critical injuries. The Browns cut Walcott from the team the day after he was arrested. Another player, Jovan Belcher of the Kansas City Chiefs, killed his girlfriend and then shot himself to death at the team’s training facility on the same day, Dec. 1, 2012. New code However you view the old case of Lewis, it’s important to note that the NFL tightened player conduct rules after taking heat for allegations of violent crime against players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson in 2014. The player conduct policy released in December 2014 lays out procedures for handling players charged with violent crimes, including some form of paid leave amid law enforcement and league investigations. The NFL Players Association takes issue with this policy, as it prevents players from team activities even though they may end up not guilty of their charges. So while it’s possible that a past player — namely Lewis — has been charged with murder without being suspended, it’s not likely that would happen today. Our ruling Trump claimed, "You can be an NFL player with murder charges and not be suspended." Today, that’s at best a highly unlikely scenario . The closest historical example we could find came from 2000 involving the case of Ray Lewis, but there is the wrinkle that his murder charges came and went during the 2000 offseason. He eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-01807	Says a new report shows the "devastating tax hikes (in the health care law) will have on middle-class Kentuckians."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/23/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-claims-devastating-tax-increase-mi/	Coal and health care are the two dominant themes in Kentucky’s hotly contested U.S. Senate race. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s campaign saw an opportunity to attack his Democratic opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, on the second issue after a new report came out on the country’s long-term fiscal health. "Alison Lundergan Grimes fully supports the implementation of Obamacare and the devastating tax hikes it will have on middle-class Kentuckians," McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a press release on July 17. The press release included several links to and excerpts from a July 16 Politico story about a new report from the Congressional Budget Office. The campaign said the story was "background information highlighting" how "Obamacare implementation will hurt middle-class Kentuckians." So clearly, McConnell’s statement is linked to the findings in this study. But did this study show "devastating tax hikes" are on the horizon for Kentucky’s middle class? Let’s take a look. The study The Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ top fiscal scorekeeper, released a report in July on the country’s long-term budget outlook. It raises concerns about the country’s current financial path if the status quo is maintained for the next 25 years, including about the country’s debt. The report also looked at the country’s tax policy. One interesting line mentioned the future impact of taxes — including some in the Affordable Care Act. "Because some parameters of the tax system are not indexed to increase with inflation, rising prices alone push a greater share of income into higher tax brackets," the report says. What does this mean? Basically, some federal taxes kick in when you reach a certain income level. These levels are not set to increase with inflation. So in 25 years, inflation will push some people past the threshold who, in today’s dollars, would not be required to pay those taxes. Summing this up, Politico headline is "CBO: Everyone’s taxes will go up quietly." But as you’ll see, the effect of the Affordable Care Act is much more limited than other parts of the tax code. The Affordable Care Act and taxes There are a couple tax levels in the Affordable Care Act that are not indexed to inflation, and therefore, over time, some people who were not paying this tax will, unless Congress makes some changes. One is a levy on investment income for individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year. It also applies to families with incomes beyond $250,000. You’ll notice right away that’s a pretty high watermark. A salary of $200,000 today would put an individual in about the top 5 percent of all income earners in the United States, according to the Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank. Clearly, that’s not middle class. But let’s play ball with McConnell and peek ahead 25 years down the road, shall we? According to the CBO report, the median total income in 2039 will be $50,900, well below the $200,000 level to qualify. For a family of four with two parents and two children, median income will be about $146,000. Higher, but still $100,000 short of the $250,000 threshold for families. Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center provided us some additional projections. By his estimates, in 2039, someone making $205,000 would be among the top 20 percent of all earners. While middle class is a loosely defined term, "you wouldn’t say top 20 percent is middle class," Williams said. "In that sense, even there, these taxes are not likely to hit very many people in the middle class, if anybody," Williams said. That’s especially true in Kentucky, a state with the fourth-lowest median income in the country. In 2018, the Affordable Care Act also phases in an excise tax on the so-called "Cadillac" or high-cost health insurance policies. The premiums for these plans are paid for almost entirely by employers, and often offer generous benefits and little cost-sharing for employees. Under Obamacare, plans that cost more than $10,200 are subject to a 40 percent tax, but only on the amount that exceeds $10,200. (Meaning if a plan costs $11,000, the insurance provider will pay taxes on $800 of it.) Those costs are likely to be passed on to employers, the CBO said. In 2009, Sarah Palin said this tax would hit those making under $200,000 the hardest. We said that was Mostly True. At the time, however, the Affordable Care Act was still working its way through Congress and the unfinished bill taxed policies exceeding $8,000, significantly less than the final outcome. Even then, analysts said it was only expected to affect about one-in-four insurance policies in 2019. (We couldn’t find any studies that analyzed this tax in the form it was signed into law.) It would be a stretch to call this tax "devastating." The CBO said the vast majority of employers are more likely to offer workers less expensive plans than pay the higher costs. However, the CBO and other economists said wages will increase to make up for the lost health benefits (which is a form of compensation). So those workers may pay some higher taxes on the increased income and see changes to their health care plans, but they’ll make more money as well. One study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that the increase in wages would far surpass additional taxes collected by the government. That is based on taxing at $8,000, not $10,200, but the general concept still holds, said Steve Zuckerman, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute. "It’s a tradeoff in compensation and slightly less generous fringe benefits," Zuckerman said. "It doesn’t seem to me it’s going to be a devastating tax increase. If anything, on balance, they’ll be paying more taxes ... but they’ll also have more take-home pay." We took all of this to Moore, McConnell’s spokeswoman. In addition to arguing that the taxes mentioned above would, over time, affect the middle class, she also pointed out that the individual mandate requiring almost all uninsured Americans to buy insurance should be considered a tax on the middle class. In upholding the law, the Supreme Court said the mandate "may reasonably be characterized as a tax" when it upheld the law. But this is not what was highlighted by the CBO report or the Politico story the campaign cited. Our ruling On the news of a new CBO report, a McConnell spokeswoman said that the implementation of Obamacare as outlined in the report would mean "devastating tax hikes ... on middle-class Kentuckians." Mostly, this report showed how more high-income earners will have to pay taxes over time, but most of the middle class wouldn’t be affected, even 25 years from now. The exception is the excise tax on high-cost plans. While just a fraction of plans would be affected, there are plenty of regular folks who have these types of policies. Still, they’re not likely to face "devastating" tax increases. It’s more probable that employers will provide less expensive insurance policies. Those employees will subsequently pay more in taxes, but only because their incomes will increase. We rate the claim from McConnell’s campaign as Mostly False.

pomt-13379	Says that except for Donald Trump, "every other major party nominee" for the past 40 years has released their tax returns.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/28/tammy-baldwin/donald-trump-only-major-party-nominee-40-years-not/	On Sept. 19, 2016, the Wisconsin Democratic Party called on Donald Trump to release his tax returns, issuing a statement that quoted U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., as saying: "The time is way past due for Donald Trump to release his tax returns, as every other major party nominee has done for the past 40 years." So, let’s see if that’s what every Democratic and Republican presidential nominee since 1976 has done. Wayback machine Baldwin has taken aim at Trump before, since he became the GOP nominee. In August 2016, we rated Half True her claim that Trump "has a long history of exporting jobs overseas." Trump-brand products such as his clothing have been made overseas, but those jobs were always abroad, not U.S. jobs that were moved. To back her current claim, Baldwin’s campaign cited editorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which said Trump would be the first major party candidate since 1976 -- 40 years ago -- not to release his tax returns. Also cited was an editorial from the Boston Globe, which said it’s been more than 40 years. But there is an exception. We checked an archive of presidential tax returns maintained by the Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy. It shows that going back to 1976, all but one major-party nominee released at least one return. Only Republican Gerald Ford, who lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, did not release returns (he released summary tax data), the archive shows. FactCheck.org also found Ford to be the one exception. Joe Thorndike, the Tax History Project director at Tax Analysts, told us that Ford’s summaries were clearly not the same as tax returns. For instance, they didn’t provide detailed information on things such as sources of income and charitable contributions. Moreover, it’s impossible to know what might be in a return unless you see the return. It's also worth noting that while some nominees have released numerous years of returns – 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole provided 30 years’ worth – others have not. In 1980, Republican Ronald Reagan released only one return and in 2012, Republican Mitt Romney released two. In the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has released returns from 2000 through 2015. As for Trump, he has said he hasn’t released his taxes because he is being audited. When he claimed he "released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. … You don't learn much in a tax return," PolitiFact National’s rating was False. Trump did release an extensive (and legally required) document detailing his personal financial holdings. But experts say tax returns would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his assets. Our rating Baldwin says that except for Trump, "every other major party nominee" for the past 40 years has released their tax returns. She’s almost right. During that period, the only major-party presidential nominee who didn’t release returns was Ford, the Republican nominee in 1976. It's also worth noting that many nominees have released numerous years of returns, but some have released only one or two. We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b799eb7-8454-41ff-a343-3c13c44e9c78	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2016-09-28T05:00:00	2016-09-19	['None']

pomt-14195	"In last week’s debate, Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/22/robby-mook/hillary-clinton-gets-02-percent-campaign-donations/	In a recent post on Medium, Robby Mook -- Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager -- countered accusations from Bernie Sanders that Clinton has been tainted by taking money from oil and gas interests. "In last week’s debate," Mook wrote of the April 14 Democratic presidential face-off in Brooklyn, "Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent." We have taken a look at this general topic before but haven’t rated this particular assertion, so we’ll do it here. A look at the numbers We turned to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data. Clinton has raised $307,561 from people employed by the oil and gas industry. It’s worth noting that not all this money comes from people with deep pockets; this total includes donations from everyone employed by the industry, from CEOs to gas-station employees. Altogether, Clinton’s campaign has raised more than $180 million, so the percentage raised from employees of the oil and gas industry works out to 0.17 percent -- which is actually a bit less than Mook said. By comparison, Sanders has raised less from oil and gas employees than Clinton has -- $53,760 -- which amounts to 0.03 percent of the $182 million his campaign has raised. In any case, this particular statistic looks solid on the math. That said, we’ll raise a caveat. Mook’s narrow focus Mook has worded the claim carefully to exclude other donations, which amounts to a bit of cherry-picking. Mook refers to "employees." But as the Sanders campaign has argued -- citing analyses by Greenpeace and the Huffington Post -- Clinton’s campaign has also received donations from lobbyists who have ties to oil and gas interests. These donations would not be reported as having come from employees of oil and gas companies and thus aren’t included in the total we calculated above. The Huffington Post article, from July 17, 2015, found that "nearly all of the lobbyists bundling contributions for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign have at one time or another worked for the fossil fuel industry." It links to 40 registered lobbyists but only offers details on some donors who still work for the industry. The Greenpeace report says that when you add in donations by lobbyists with an alleged tie to the fossil fuel industry, Clinton's total would rise to nearly $1.8 million. The fossil fuel industry's share of the Clinton coffers would go up to about 0.8 percent. The Sanders campaign added that the Greenpeace report goes a step further to include more than $4 million to Priorities Action USA, the super PAC that supports Clinton. And the Sanders team said that Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil have donated at least $2.5 million to the Clinton Foundation. "I understand the Clinton campaign objects to these figures, because some of the fossil fuel lobbyists who have bundled huge sums of money for their campaign also represent clients in other industries," said Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels. "In our view, that makes these contributions even more objectionable. It's the lobbyists in Washington who write the bills and curry special favors for the firms they represent. You can't reform big oil and gas companies by taking bundled campaign cash from their lobbyists." The Sanders critique is not a slam-dunk, however For starters, it’s a stretch to draw a direct line between those super PAC donations and Clinton’s campaign. Under federal law, the candidates have no control over super PAC spending. In addition, it’s up for debate how significant these lobbyists’ donations are. It’s not clear how much of influence the oil and gas industry would wield through a donor who once lobbied for them but doesn’t any more. In some cases, the lobbyists advocated for clients in multiple industries, not just oil and gas. Finally, Clinton’s stances on oil and gas issues is not exactly in tune with the industry. She has said that if individuals from the industry want to donate to her, they should know that they may be wasting their money. She favors policies the oil and gas industry doesn’t like, and she is a big supporter of renewable energy, a philosophy Sanders has also embraced. Our ruling Mook wrote, "In last week’s debate, Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent." Mook’s statement is accurate, though it’s carefully constructed to exclude donations by lobbyists who have at one time represented the industry -- a point made by Sanders, though its relevance is up for debate. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f1dfea64-4e60-4564-9663-e348645568ed	None	Robby Mook	None	None	None	2016-04-22T13:54:32	2016-04-19	['None']

pomt-09696	An amendment to the House health reform bill "puts new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market even when they would pay premiums with their own money."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/09/nita-lowey/lowey-says-stupak-amendment-restricts-abortion-cov/	An amendment about abortion coverage was a key reason Democrats were able to narrowly pass the sweeping health care reform bill in the House of Representatives on Nov. 7, 2009. But that same amendment has emerged as a flashpoint that has some Democrats threatening to ultimately oppose the bill. The question of abortion funding has been a long-running and contentious issue in the current health care debate, and we have already addressed the question in the context of the Senate Finance Committee bill here and here . Specifically at issue is whether the new system of exchanges and subsidies for uninsured Americans envisioned by the House health care bill would result in federal money being spent on abortion services -- something that has been barred since 1976, with passage of the Hyde Amendment. The amendment, by Reps. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., and Joe Pitts, R-Pa., has explicit restrictions on abortion coverage that go beyond the language of the original bill. The amendment passed the House on a 240-194 vote. It won the support of 64 mostly antiabortion Democrats, joining with all Republicans except for Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who voted present. A wide majority of Democrats opposed the Stupak-Pitts amendment. Opponents of the amendment argued that it amounted to a severe infringement on rights that have been upheld by the Supreme Court in the landmark case Roe vs. Wade. During the House debate, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., explained that she would support the health care bill despite approval of the abortion amendment, which she strongly opposed. "Now, this bill is not perfect," Lowey said. "I am deeply disappointed that the House approved language which puts new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market even when they would pay premiums with their own money." For this item, we'll explore whether she is correct that it puts new restrictions on abortion coverage in the private market even when women would pay their own premium. On one issue right off the bat, we believe Lowey is misleading. The Stupak amendment -- which now accounts for about four pages of the nearly 2,000-page bill -- does not address the entire "private health insurance market." Rather, it addresses how abortion coverage would be handled within the health insurance "exchanges" included in the Democratic-sponsored House health care bill. These exchanges would provide a virtual marketplace for health insurance for those who do not already have coverage through their employer or through a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The exchange is designed for people who are self-employed or work for very small businesses -- but it would serve at most a small fraction of Americans, since most people get their insurance either through their employer, a spouse's employer or through existing government programs. So, by not specifying that she's talking about how abortion coverage would be handled in the exchange, Lowey immediately makes the issue seem to affect many more people than it actually does. And she makes an additional, and we believe more significant, misrepresentation when she says that abortion coverage would be restricted for beneficiaries "even when they would pay premiums with their own money." The amendment says that individuals buying insurance on the exchange may still purchase coverage that includes abortions as long as no federal money is used. It also says that insurers may still offer abortion coverage as long as such coverage, and the administrative structure behind it, is not supported by federal money, and as long as their insurance offerings on the exchange include two nearly identical options, one of which covers abortion services and one of which does not. Whether someone would be affected by the restriction depends on whether they receive what the bill calls "affordability credits" -- federal subsidies that would help the lower-middle class buy coverage. People who choose to receive the subsidies would indeed face more significant restrictions on abortion coverage. If they want a plan with abortion coverage, they would have to buy a separate, add-on plan for abortion coverage known as a "rider," using their own money. But Lowey said the amendment "puts new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market even when they would pay premiums with their own money ." We believe that Lowey's formulation is, at best, misleading. The people who would truly pay all of the premium with their own money -- and who would not use federal subsidies at all -- are not barred in any way from obtaining abortion coverage, even if they obtain their insurance from the federally administered health exchange. Lowey's office counters that exchange participants who get the subsidies do indeed pay a share of their premiums with their own money, maybe even a majority of the cost. But if that's what Lowey meant, she should have said abortion coverage would be prohibited "even when they pay part, or most, of their premiums with their own money." Not making that distinction, combined with her failure to specify that she was discussing only people who use the exchange, suggests that the restrictions are more severe and widespread than they actually are. Some in the abortion-rights community do actually make a stronger case that the amendment would harm individuals who pay for their coverage without subsidies. This line of argument involves what insurance companies might do from a business perspective in response to the amendment. Some critics say that the amendment throws up enough obstacles against offering abortion coverage on the health exchange -- particularly the requirement to offer two separate plans, one of them without abortion provisions -- that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and offer a single plan that leaves out abortion coverage. Some also argue that companies will be reluctant to offer riders for abortion coverage, or that there won't be much demand for them. This could indirectly diminish the abortion coverage options for people on the exchange who don't take subsidies, even though the law doesn't limit their options directly. There's plenty of room for debate about how the Stupak-Pitts amendment will eventually shape the availability of abortion coverage. But Lowey is wrong on two points. First, she suggests the amendment applies to everyone in the private insurance market when it just applies to those in the health care exchange. Second, her statement that the restrictions would affect women "even when they would pay premiums with their own money" is incorrect. In fact, women on the exchange who pay the premiums with their own money will be able to get abortion coverage. So we find her statement False.

pomt-07154	"Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/14/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-cites-cbo-says-health-care-law-cuts-80/	The Congressional Budget Office is an authoritative, nonpartisan source of information, so Florida U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner must have been eager to source it in attacking the 2010 federal health care law. In a lead-up to court arguments over the law's constitutionality, Hasner issued a press statement that referenced the CBO to describe how the health care law -- if upheld -- would kill jobs. "Implementation of Obamacare has played a major role in prolonging our country's economic challenges," he said June 8, 2011. "Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs. Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months." At PolitiFact, we've tackled a broad statement made by House Republican leader Eric Cantor that the health care law is "job killing" and rated it False. But we wondered about Hasner's more specific claim about the CBO and 800,000 jobs. (Interestingly, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachman made the same claim during June 13th's New Hampshire Republican presidential debate). We found a source for the claim easy enough. On Feb. 10, CBO Director Doug Elmendorf testified before the House Budget Committee and was asked how the federal health care law would affect the job market. The Weekly Standard, a magazine for conservatives, said in a headline that Elmendorf said "Obamacare Would Reduce Employment by 800,000 Workers." Hasner campaign spokesman Rick Wilson also provided links to stories in POLITICO -- CBO: Health law to shrink workforce by 800,000, and a clip of Elmendorf's testimony on YouTube. The Weekly Standard article includes two exchanges from the hearing. Chairman (Paul) Ryan, R-Wis.: "(I)t's been argued...that the new health care law will create jobs and increase labor force participation. But if I recall from your analysis, it was quite the opposite. Is that not the case?" Director (Douglas) Elmendorf : "Yes."... Rep. (John) Campbell, R-Calif.: "Thank you, Mr. Chairman, we'll -- and Dr. Elmendorf -- and we'll continue this conversation right now. First on health care, before I get to -- before I get to broader issues, you just mentioned that you believe -- or that in your estimate, that the health care law would reduce the labor used in the economy by about 1/2 of 1 percent, given that, I believe you say, there's 160 million full-time people working in '20-'21. That means that, in your estimation, the health care law would reduce employment by 800,000 in '20-'21. Is that correct?" Director Elmendorf: "Yes. The way I would put it is that we do estimate, as you said, that...employment will be about 160 million by the end of the decade. Half a percent of that is 800,000." We checked the transcript provided by The Weekly Standard against the one kept by Congressional Quarterly and wanted to make one correction to the record. The first question was from Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., not Ryan. We also thought it appropriate to continue Elmendorf's second answer for additional context. After saying that "half a percent of that is 800,000," Elmendorf continued: "That means that if the reduction in the labor used was workers working the average number of hours in the economy and earning the average wage, that there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers. "In fact, as we mentioned in the -- in our announcements last summer, the legislation also creates incentives that might affect the number of hours people work, might affect the tendency to work with lower and higher income people. We haven't tried to quantify those things. But the impact is that these 800,000 (jobs) might not be exactly the number ..." So Elmendorf did say there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers -- while noting that the number could change slightly. That might sound the same as Hasner's claim that the health care law will "cost 800,000 jobs," but it's not. The specific CBO analysis explains why. In a budget and economic outlook update from August 2010, the CBO included some analysis on the federal health care law and its effects on the labor market. The CBO wrote: "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount — roughly half a percent — primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law." Basically, the CBO says that some people right now are working mostly to keep their health insurance. Once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The analysis also finds that "some older workers will choose to retire earlier than they otherwise would." Conversely, the CBO concluded that the health care law removes an existing disincentive to work for many low-income individuals by raising Medicaid income eligibility limits. As far as trying to address Hasner's claim that the health care law will cost jobs (meaning businesses will hire less workers or lay off existing employees) the CBO is more vague. "Employers' decisions to hire workers will also be affected in some cases by the health care legislation," the CBO said. "Employers with 50 or more employees will be required to pay a penalty if they do not offer insurance or if the insurance they offer does not meet certain criteria and at least one of their workers receives a subsidy from an exchange. Those penalties, whose amounts are based on the number of full-time workers in the firm, will, over time, generally be passed on to workers through reductions in wages or other forms of compensation. "However, firms generally cannot reduce workers’ wages below the minimum wage, which will probably cause some employers to respond by hiring fewer low-wage workers. Alternatively, because firms are penalized only if their full-time employees receive subsidies from exchanges, some firms may instead hire more part-time or seasonal employees." The CBO also found that because it could be easier for workers to find health insurance, they may be more likely to take jobs that better match their skills. And an improved health system could result in a more productive economy. In an e-mail, Hasner spokesman Rick Wilson responded: "If Obamacare creates structural macroeconomic conditions that reduce the net number of working people, it's still a net cost to GDP (gross domestic product)." Hasner cited the CBO director in making the claim that the health care law would "cost 800,000 jobs," and provided the context that nearly 1 million Floridians already are out of work. But that's not really what the CBO has said, something our colleagues at Factcheck.org have pointed out as well. There could be the equivalent of 800,000 fewer workers thanks to the federal health care law, according to the CBO, but not because employers wouldn't hire them. It's because workers wouldn't have to work because the new law expands health care coverage. That means people working primarily for health care would either reduce their hours or leave the job market altogether. Hasner's statement is out of context and misleading. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07469	Tim Kaine proposed "over $6 billion in tax increases from the time he entered the governor’s mansion until the time he left."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/16/george-allen/george-allen-says-tim-kaine-proposed-6-billion-tax/	Hours after Democrat Tim Kaine announced he is running for Virginia’s open Senate seat in 2012, Republican George Allen, a rival candidate, was on the attack. Allen’s campaign manager told supporters in an e-mail that Kaine was a "big government" liberal who proposed more than "$6 billion in tax increases from the time he entered the Governor’s mansion until the time he left." We wondered if Kaine’s record as governor matched Allen’s claim. Kaine led the state from 2006 to 2010. Katie Wright, Allen’s director of communications, sent us a breakdown of supposed tax-increases advanced by Kaine. The largest proposed hikes, from 2006 through 2008, were aimed at raising money for Virginia’s overcrowded roads. Transportation has troubled state politicians for nearly a decade, as growing populations in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads face ever-denser gridlock. In other parts of the state, rural highways need expansions and arterial interstates are facing increased traffic loads. The Senate has wanted to raise taxes to build roads, arguing it is vital to establish a permanent source of new revenues. In this year’s General Assembly session, GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell won approval for a $4 billion package that relies on borrowing and surplus funds found in an audit of the state transportation department. Critics say the plan provides only a small, short-term solution to transportation woes. Allen’s statement is based on three tax proposals by Kaine. The first came days after Kaine took office. He rolled out an unsuccessful plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Allen, factoring in the four years of Kaine’s term, calls this a $4 billion tax increase. That’s a misleading number. State tax increases are typically valued by the yearly revenues they produce. So this is more accurately described as a $1 billion tax increase. Kaine wanted to raise taxes on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees and imposing steeper fines on drivers who got tickets. The registration fees are similar to a tax, since all drivers must register their cars. But Allen takes license when he calls higher fines for traffic offenses a tax, since those payments can easily be avoided. The State Senate’s plan, proposed by the body’s Republican leaders, also raised taxes on vehicle purchases and proposed higher taxes on the price wholesale gasoline, which stations buy from distributors and then resell to individual customers, often passing along the tax to motorists in the form of higher prices. Kaine’s second tax proposal came during the summer of 2008, when lawmakers gathered for a special transportation session. Ahead of the conclave, Kaine proposed a $1.1 billion plan that would increase the titling tax to 4 percent from 3 percent, and hike vehicle registration fees by $10. Kaine’s plan and competing proposals were again killed, leaving the state without a long-term transportation solution. Kaine’s final tax proposal came during his last month in office, when he proposed raising the state’s income tax and wiping out the car tax. Between 1998 and 2000, the state phased out most of the local property taxes on vehicles. As of December 2009, the localities were receiving about $1.6 billion from vehicle taxes. The state originally covered 70 percent of that car tax income, with the rest coming from taxpayers in twice-a-year payments. But as the cost of the reimbursement climbed, lawmakers set a $950 million cap on the payments to cities and counties. Kaine thought the car tax had become too complicated should be trashed. To offset the loss to localities, he proposed increasing the state’s 5.75 percent income tax to 6.75 percent. That would generate $1.9 billion a year, and Kaine wanted to give all the money to municipalities. In reality, this $1.9 billion increase would be partially offset by the $650 million taxpayers would no longer pay to localities. By our math, this was really a proposal to raise taxes by $1.25 billion. Some low-income taxpayers would have seen lower overall payments, while other people would have paid slightly more. The state would not have received any new revenue from the deal, but it would have stopped paying $950 million to localities each year. Having steered you though the twists and turns of state policy, let’s conduct an after-action review. George Allen says Tim Kaine proposed "over $6 billion in tax increases" as governor. Kaine did suggest a $1 billion per year transportation plan, mixing taxes with new fees and fines, during 2006. But Republicans also proposed new taxes for transportation that year. The 2007 transportation compromise between Kaine and Republican legislators left the taxing power with regional authorities and raised most of its other funding through debt financing and higher traffic fines. The 2008 plan contained another $1.1 billion tax proposal, but only because Kaine was unsuccessful in garnering new transportation funds in the prior two years. In effect, Allen is trying to double-count Kaine’s transportation-related proposals. The governor had to keep crafting new plans because elected officials in both parties repeatedly failed to find a long-term solution. Had a deal been reached in 2006, Kaine would not have laid out new plans in 2007 and 2008. And the governor’s 2009 proposal was really a move to replace one type of tax with another. By our count, Kaine proposed raising about $4 billion in new taxes -- $1 billion in 2006, $1.1 billion in 2008 and $1.9 billion in 2009. Of those increases, the 2008 plan represented a second attempt to raise new road funding, and the 2009 proposal would have been partially offset by a $650 million reduction in local car taxes. So Allen’s campaign is right that Kaine proposed some tax increases, but inflates the number by 50 percent. The campaign also fails to acknowledge the offsets in Kaine’s final plan. We rate this claim Half True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2011-04-16T08:00:00	2011-04-05	['None']
pomt-04810	"From a standpoint of the county government, neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/20/martavius-jones/memphis-schools-president-says-shelby-county-fundi/	As the brouhaha over schools continues in the state’s largest county, funding issues have stayed secondary to the crucial legal questions involving whether Memphis can successfully force real countywide schools consolidation with its suburban Shelby County neighbors. But Martavius Jones, the former Memphis City Schools board president who helped lead the surrender of the system’s charter last year, gave a preview of funding rhetoric likely to grow louder as the July 1, 2013, deadline for completing merger grows near. Given that more than 16 percent of the state’s education money goes to schools in Memphis and Shelby County, how the issue plays out could have a ripple effect on systems across the state. A private financial planner and executive committee member of the county’s schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC), Jones appeared on a Fox 13 News morning show to discuss the legal fight between the city and suburbs. After giving his view that the suburbs were following an unconstitutional path toward splitting the county into essentially seven school districts, Jones said the planning commission’s had created a blueprint for a "world class" unified school district. However, he added, "the funding issue is quite an obstacle." "From a standpoint of the county government," Jones said, "neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years." Jones backed up his assertion in an email to us: "By the time the districts are merged in 2013, it would have been six years since there was an increase in funding from the county." In terms of their overall budgets, we knew that MCS, still in existence for one final school year, and the for now still suburban-only Shelby County Schools had seen slight increases in overall expenditures. In Tennessee, although a large chunk of the most counties’ operating budgets goes toward school operations, the majority of funding for schools comes from the state. So it’s possible that school budgets grew even while local contributions remained flat. And a look at budgets for the county confirms that, every year since the 2008 fiscal year, the county has allocated the same number of property-tax dollars to the county’s schools -- $361,288,000. That big number has been apportioned to the county’s two school districts (MCS and SCS) according to enrollment, or what is known as Average Daily Attendance, with the current split about 68 percent for the city and 32 percent for the suburbs. Enrollment numbers fluctuate somewhat each year, so that a marginal fraction of funds seesaw back and forth between MCS and SCS. Mike Ritz, budget chairman for the county commission and its chairman beginning next month, has some real quarrels with how Jones and other school officials frame the funding argument, but he says: "He’s absolutely right -- since I was elected we’ve stopped paying extra money." What irks Ritz is what he calls "complaining" by schools officials that the county is not providing more money, because he believes it distracts from the fact that MCS and SCS have seen big increases in money from the state. Some recent changes in the state’s funding formula have increased state funding for larger school districts like those in Shelby, Davidson, Hamilton and Knox County. "Quite frankly, they’ve had a humongous increase in funds available," Ritz said. "That’s why I keep telling the commissioners that we don’t need to worry about (increasing funding) when the state continues to do it for them." We’ll leave that statement aside for a potential future PolitiFact, although public-school advocates have a ready rejoinder. They point out that even while the county has stopped increasing school funding, revenues for county government have been steadily increased. Property tax revenue in 2008 was $675.1 million but is projected at $714.0 million for 2013 -- a 5.6 percent increase. So education funding as a percentage of the county budget has actually dropped. Another point Ritz could have made (but didn't) -- enrollment has been dropping slightly in both systems. From 2008-09 to 2011-12, the combined "weighted" ADA for MCS and SCS did show a 3-percent drop, so that $361,288,000 in county funds got spread over slightly smaller systems. School officials like to point out, however, that education costs, like healthcare costs, escalate rapidly, though for the purposes of this item we'll point out that overall inflation from 2008 to 2012 was about 6.3 percent. Expect this debate to continue -- the schools merger Transition Planning Commission’s plan shows a hole in the 2012-13 budget of $68 million, which happens to be equivalent to the funds that Memphis has been contributing in recent years to MCS. But Memphis’s funding, which had been required by courts based on the state’s maintenance-of-effort law, will go away for next fiscal year because MCS will be completely dissolved and its operations transferred to the county by July 1, 2013. The TPC has recommended lobbying the city, the state and the county to provide money to patch that funding hole -- the city and state have each strongly indicated that will not happen. Jones knows that as well as anyone, and the county commission can expect to feel even more pressure going forward to increase school funding and fill the the budget hole for the new district. Our ruling Ritz may well have a point -- schools officials do bemoan the static local funding even while receiving increases from its chief funding source, the state. But Jones is right -- because the county has not increased schools funding since the 2008 fiscal year, this 2013 fiscal year marks a sixth straight year the county has declined to increase its funding of schools. We rule his statement True.	None	Martavius Jones	None	None	None	2012-08-20T06:15:45	2012-07-13	['None']
pomt-14604	Says Catherine Cortez Masto "was happy to line her own pockets with taxpayer dollars when state employees were slammed with frozen salaries."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/feb/03/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-attacks-cortez-masto-pay-raise-issue/	Getting a raise as an elected official has to be a tough balancing act. This is especially the case in Nevada, where the state Constitution historically prohibited salary raises for any legislator or the state’s six executive officers, except through an act of the state Legislature. That meant even reasonable requests to update compensation could fall victim to political gamesmanship. It’s also why, on the same day that former Democratic attorney general and current Nevada Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto addressed a union-backed summit on raising the minimum wage earlier in January, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pounced. The advocacy group unloaded on the candidate for the "shameless hypocrisy" in accepting a pay raise in 2011 while other officials refused in order to support state workers with mandated furloughs and frozen pay. Here’s what the NRSC said in full: "In addition to frozen salaries, workers dealt with furloughs that further cut into their take-home pay. Then-Attorney General Cortez Masto accepted a taxpayer-funded 6 percent pay raise, increasing her salary from $133,000 to $141,086 annually – even as other Nevada elected officials declined the salary hike." Because these allegations make Cortez Masto look oblivious to state workers who faced years of furloughs and frozen pay, we wanted to take a closer look at the NRSC’s claim. Making sense of the salary formula can be rather complex for each of Nevada’s six independently elected constitutional officers (governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, treasurer and controller). Historically, Nevada’s Constitution required the part-time state Legislature to make any salary adjustment for the state’s six constitutional officers. Although the cost of living has slightly increased since Nevada became a state in 1864, any request to increase salaries often turned political, especially when legislative majorities and constitutional officers belonged to different parties. And so in 2005, lawmakers attempted to avoid that pitfall by including a clause to an otherwise routine salary increase bill for state executive officers that changed the process significantly. Under the new law, state employee pay increases over a four-year period would then be added as an equivalent salary increase for the six executive officers, applying for the next four-year term. This well-intentioned plan proceeded to backfire spectacularly. After state employees received a 2 percent salary increase in 2007 and a 4 percent increase in 2008, the economies of the nation and Nevada tanked. With unemployment rates hitting record highs and state lawmakers approving "more than $1 billion in cuts to worker salaries and state programs" to close the state’s gaping budget hole, legislators entered the 2011 session with a problem: an unwanted but legislatively mandated 6 percent pay raise. Lawmakers rejected an attempt to delay the mandatory raise, and because the state Constitution prevents meddling with the salaries of elected officials while in office, the six constitutional officers and the 63 members of the Legislature were essentially forced to take an untimely pay bump while most state employees were forced to take an unpaid furlough. This is where the NRSC allegations come into play. Gov. Brian Sandoval "rejected" the pay raise and returned it to the state, while Cortez Masto and then-Controller Kim Wallin (both Democrats) decided to accept the pay increase. But there is a huge caveat: Cortez Masto, along with the other five constitutional officers, donated a small portion of their salary both before and after 2011 back to the state as a show of support for state employees forced to take unpaid days off. Both Sandoval and Cortez Masto actually gave back money to the state; they just gave it back in different ways. According to information collected from TransparentNevada.com and records request from the state Controller’s office, PolitiFact Nevada put together this spreadsheet of salaries, donations and what percentage of salary was donated back to the state. As shown, it’s clear that as Attorney General, Cortez Masto didn’t "pad her pockets" while state workers suffered -- rather, she received essentially the same salary (not counting benefits) during her eight years in office when donations are subtracted out. And due to quirky provisions in Nevada law, the constitutional officers couldn’t outright reject the pay increase, meaning that the governor and other constitutional officers who "rejected" the pay increase had to find creative ways to re-distribute the new income, including cutting weekly checks to nonprofits, that made up the difference. In response to inquiries about the allegations, Nevada Democratic Party communications director Zach Hudson said in a statement that the facts were being distorted. "The fact is that as Attorney General, when state workers were furloughed, Catherine Cortez Masto stood with them and voluntarily donated tens of thousands of dollars of her salary back to the taxpayers," he said in a statement. The NRSC cited two articles backing up their statement, an editorial in the Elko Daily Free Press and a story in the Las Vegas Sun that claimed that Masto and others "are going to keep the 6 percent pay raise." That may have been what it seemed like at the time of the reports, but Cortez Masto did give an average of 6.3 percent of her salary back every year, which is comparable to others who "rejected" the pay increase. Our ruling The NRSC said Cortez Masto "was happy to line her own pockets with taxpayer dollars when state employees were slammed with frozen salaries," but this is a highly misleading claim. The state increased Cortez Masto’s salary during a time of pay freezes for Nevada’s state workers. She was unable to legally reject the pay increase, so she donated $38,000 back to the state during her last four years in office. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-13790	Donald Trump "rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/jul/20/scott-peters/ca-congressman-repeats-mostly-true-critique-donald/	During Donald Trump’s recent fundraising trip to San Diego, Democratic Congressman Scott Peters had some harsh words for the GOP nominee. "His economic policies are dangerous," Peters, who represents much of 'America's Finest City,' told reporters on a conference call. "He will say or do anything that benefits him." We can’t fact check that statement because it’s the congressman’s opinion. But Peters repeated one critique that’s open to examination: "This is a guy," he said of Trump, "who rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it." Congressman Scott Peters, D-San Diego, campaigns at a town hall in October 2014. AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi Hillary Clinton lodged the same attack in a May campaign video. "In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash," the ad says, showing a picture of Trump giving two thumbs up. The ad goes on to list consequences from the Great Recession, which peaked in 2008. It lists 9 million jobs lost and 5 million families who lost their homes. This campaign ad from Hillary For America includes 2006 audio from Donald Trump about the housing market. That's followed by audio, identified as being from 2006, of Trump saying, "I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy ... If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money." "And the man who could be our next president was rooting for it to happen," the ad contends. Peters’ statement that Trump "rooted for the housing crisis," clearly draws on the Clinton ad. His office referred us to the Democratic National Committee, which supplied the Clinton ad with Trump’s "I sort of hope that happens" audio. Our national PolitiFact team checked the original claim made in May by the Clinton ad and rated it Mostly True. Here’s why: "I sort of hope that happens" Trump’s statement comes from the audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, which has been the subject of three lawsuits from former "students" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. In 2006, real estate values had peaked and there was concern that they were overpriced, creating a "bubble" that could burst, producing a rapid fall in values. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, "There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?" "Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy," he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. "If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money." Whether the "bubble burst" that Trump was hoping for deserves to be called a "crash," especially a crash on the scale of what occurred during the Great Recession, is open to debate. Trump, in the audiobook, adds: "At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit." Obviously, he would turn out to be wrong. A year later, in 2007, Trump was telling the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. "People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is," he told the paper. "I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets." The Trump campaign didn't respond to PolitiFact's emails. Our ruling Rep. Scott Peters, D-CA, said Donald Trump "rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it." His statement parallels a claim in Hillary Clinton’s May campaign ad: "In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash." Trump said on more than one occasion that he welcomed a downturn in the real estate market because it would give him a chance to buy properties at a bargain and sell them at a higher price later. What's far less clear is whether Trump was rooting for something on the scale of the Great Recession, a suggestion made in the Clinton ad, or a "housing crisis," as suggested by Peters. In fact, Trump’s comments in his audiobook and to the Globe and Mail show he didn't envision the financial meltdown that followed. PolitiFact rated Clinton’s statement Mostly True, saying it was "accurate but needs clarification or additional information." For the same reason, we rate Peters’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-11573	"Instead of two for one, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for everyone new rule."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/02/donald-trump/trump-hasnt-cut-22-regulations-every-new-one/	Trump claimed to have gone above and beyond his campaign promise to eliminate two existing regulations for every new federal regulation at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland. "Instead of two for one, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every one new rule," Trump said. The White House directed us to a press release that said federal agencies issued 67 deregulatory actions and imposed three new regulatory actions. Did Trump really keep his promise, eleven-fold? That’s an exaggeration. The problem with Trump’s claim is that the Office of Management and Budget laid out different criteria for defining regulatory and deregulatory actions in complying with Trump’s directive. Significant regulatory actions are defined as leading "to an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy (...) ." "This is an attempt to not have to offset or otherwise subject to this executive order regulatory actions that are routine, or fairly administrative, or technical in nature," said Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at the left-leaning Public Citizen. Examples include time tables for opening up drawbridges, or clearing trees that overhang airplane runways. But their lifts could count as deregulatory, per the definition of deregulatory actions: a finalized action with total savings greater than zero. That’s a much lower bar than the $100 million figure. "When you put things in a ratio form, you’re saying these are comparable units," Cary Coglianese, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Program on Regulation, said. "These are not." When Coglianese took a look at the federal regulatory agenda, released Dec. 14, 2017, he found 62 deregulatory actions. (Not all of Trump’s 67 deregulatory actions were included in the review.) Coglianese found the Office of Management and Budget deemed 8 percent of these economically significant (exceeding $100 million in costs); 27 percent significant enough to warrant review, but not due to economic impacts; and two-thirds non-significant, administrative, or routine. When we plugged each of the 67 listed actions into the federal regulatory agenda, we found five that were classified as economically significant. The most common classification was non-significant. Dan Goldbeck, a senior regulatory policy analyst at the right-leaning American Action Forum, used a different methodology. Tracking only rules with some economic estimate of costs or savings, albeit no specified threshold, Goldbeck found the Trump administration had imposed nine deregulatory actions, and five regulatory ones. By these measures, Trump barely made the two for one ratio. The deregulatory action with the greatest estimated savings was the repeal of a Federal Acquisition Regulation on "Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces", estimated to have saved $417 million in fiscal year 2017. The repeal was possible thanks to a joint resolution from Congress, which was then ratified by the president. Our ruling Trump said, "Instead of two for one, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every one new rule." The Trump administration counted only regulatory actions that were deemed economically significant. Without the same stipulation for deregulatory actions, the ratio compares apples to oranges. Trump has repealed five economically significant regulatory actions to three economically significant new regulations, according our search of the Office of Management and Budget database. The American Action Forum found he repealed nine regulations for the five he imposed. Using comparable units, Trump’s claim overestimates his deregulatory accomplishments. By two measures, it’s actually a little less than two for one. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-01399	David Perdue did not support the 2014 farm bill that U.S. Sens. Isakson and Chambliss did.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/13/michelle-nunn/nunn-right-about-perdues-opposition-farm-bill/	One of rare compromises out of Congress this year has become a talking point in Georgia’s hotly contested U.S. Senate race. At issue is the 2014 Farm Bill, a bipartisan effort that ended direct payments to farmers, beefed up crop insurance and cut funding for food stamps. Michelle Nunn, the Democratic candidate running for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat, invoked her support of the bill in her first debate this week with Republican candidate David Perdue. "Saxby Chambliss, Johnny Isakson, have said that the farm bill was the most important piece of legislation to Georgians, and yet you stood against it," Nunn said. Given agriculture pumps $71 billion into the state’s economy every year, making it the state’s largest industry, implying lack of support for farmers is serious business. But is it true? PolitFact Georgia decided to check. Nunn’s claim is designed to bolster her bipartisan bona fides - and showcase where she agrees with conservatives such as Georgia’s two current senators, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, and powerful groups, such as the Georgia and American farm bureaus. Both Perdue and Nunn have said they want to serve on the Senate agriculture committee. Her claim is based on statements that Perdue made in February, when he was running in the crowded GOP primary. Of the seven Republicans running, only U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Savannah, said he supported the farm bill. At the time of that debate, Nunn had already voiced her support for the measure, which took more than two years to pass, as well as her intent to seek a seat on the Senate’s agriculture committee, said her spokesman Nathan Click. "While David Perdue opposed the Farm Bill -- the No. 1 legislative priority for Georgia farmers -- Michelle Nunn has said since the beginning of this campaign that fighting for Georgia farmers is one of her top priorities," Click said. Lawmakers across the political spectrum supported the farm bill largely because of the importance of agriculture in various states. Isakson and Chambliss both supported the final bill, with Chambliss taking the floor of the Senate to urge others to vote with him. "There is no single piece of legislation that impacts as many people in my state as this one," said Chambliss, a former agriculture lawyer. Opposition came mostly from the far-left and far-right of each party. Democrats who voted against the bill complained about $8.6 billion cut over a decade to food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. Republican opponents claimed those cuts did not go far enough. Perdue sides with the GOP opponents to the measure, said spokesman Derrick Dickey. He believes that Congress missed an opportunity for a broader overhaul of the food stamp program. "We have seen exponential growth in food stamps throughout the years," Dickey said. "David supports a discussion focused on getting those people back to work, separate from protections from farmers." That sort of debate would require a bifurcated bill, to fund agriculture and nutrition. An effort to do just that failed in Congress before lawmakers rallied behind the compromise. With that history, it is clear that Nunn is correct to say Perdue did not support the 2014 farm bill. But it is an overreach to imply that opposition to the bill translates into opposition to farmers or agriculture. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-07495	"The benefits that were offered to me as a congressman don’t even compare to the benefits that you get as a state employee. I just experienced that myself. They’re not nearly as good."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/12/sean-duffy/us-rep-sean-duffy-says-wisconsin-state-employees-g/	Pressed by an underemployed constituent to defend his $174,000 salary, newly elected U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) surprised a town-hall meeting audience with a tale of personal financial woe. The father of six said a pile of mortgage and student loan debt, the lack of a paycheck when he left his job to campaign full time and the cost of his new government-provided pension and health benefits were causing him to "struggle to meet my bills." With a few more congressional paychecks under his belt, would his financial crunch ease? "Maybe," Duffy told the group Feb. 23, 2011 at an Amery senior center, "but at this point I’m not living high on the hog." Duffy’s comments, after getting an 86 percent pay raise from his state job as an elected district attorney in Ashland County, earned him denunciations from state and national Democrats as out of touch with his northern Wisconsin district. A video of Duffy’s comments surfaced only recently. Duffy later said his words were "poorly chosen," and his staff says he was just expressing his feelings on the transition from state to federal employee -- not complaining about his pay. Fair enough. Duffy may indeed by having trouble making ends meet, but that’s not readily checkable. And we’re not interested in how many miles he’s put on the used minivan he said he drives. But one comment caught our attention: "The benefits that were offered to me as a congressman don’t even compare to the benefits that you get as a state employee," said Duffy. "I just experienced that myself. They’re not nearly as good." He termed the state benefits "gold plated." Let’s see if Duffy is right about state vs. federal benefits. Our first stop was Duffy. After all, he’s in the best position to explain his benefits and his finances. In his town hall remarks, Duffy said he was now paying $600 a month -- 10 times more than the $60 a month he said he paid for his old state health plan. He also talked about retirement income. He said at the town hall session that Wisconsin paid 100 percent of his pension. Duffy, who left a $93,662-a-year job for the state in mid-2010 to campaign for Congress, declined to tell us which of the various federal health insurance plans he had selected. He also declined to discuss specifics of his other benefits choices. So we’ll look at the cost of the range of benefits offered to the average state employee with the average federal employee -- as well those offered to elected officials. The two main areas, of course, are health care and retirement benefits. Health insurance Under Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s controversial changes, state employees would start paying more toward their health care. But Duffy left state employment last summer, so we’ll compare the state’s insurance at that point with what federal employees were offered this year. Looking at it a couple ways, Duffy’s state health insurance was considerably cheaper. For non-union worker, the monthly premium contribution in 2010 was at one of three levels -- $85, $188 or $448 -- depending on which plan was selected. But the vast majority of non-union state employees were in the $85 tier -- paying about 5 percent of the total premium cost. Duffy said he paid $60 a month; it’s not clear what he was referring to. At the federal level for 2011, the most popular family plan is $431.60 a month -- which is about one-third of the total cost. An $85 monthly payment or $431 -- that’s a big difference. And for the employee, less means more in their pocket. But the range of employee premiums at the federal level is $170 to $693. So there are plans that are much closer to the state prices than the $600-a-month plan Duffy says he selected. Retirement earnings Members of Congress kick in 1.3 percent of their pay and the government puts in a bigger amount to help fund their pensions. Regular federal employees contribute 0.8 percent of pay. So most federal employees are kicking in less than 1 percent. By contrast, most Wisconsin state workers during Duffy’s state tenure paid 0 percent -- the state picked up the whole contribution. So that’s a difference, though not a dramatic one. Looking past the employee’s out of pocket costs, the state kicked in 11.6 percent of a general worker’s pay toward pensions -- almost exactly the same as general federal employees now get. Duffy’s getting a bigger employer contribution in Congress, though, than he did from the state. It was 13.3 percent at the state and in Congress it’s 17.9 percent, based on the funding needs of their pension plans. Finally, federal workers get an second bite of the pie: In addition to their traditional pension, they can join the Thrift Savings Plan, a retirement benefit similar to the 401(k) plans available in the private sector. Under the plan, the federal government makes a contribution to the account equal to 1 percent of the employee’s salary even if workers contribute nothing themselves. Above that, the employee contributions are matched up to 5 percent. So, with Duffy’s salary of $174,000, his retirement fund would get $1,740 a year even if he chooses not to set aside any funds. The state of Wisconsin offers no such "defined contribution" plan to employees. So that’s a plus for federal employees. Let’s get to the bottom line. New to office, Duffy was under questioning at the town hall meeting from a builder who now drives a bus for a second job. The man said his wife is a Wisconsin teacher facing benefit cuts. Duffy said he was struggling financially due to several things, including the cost of federal fringe benefits compared with those offered by his old employer, the State of Wisconsin. He said the federal benefits "don’t even compare" and aren't "nearly as good." Duffy apparently selected one of the higher-priced health plans, but won’t say which one, so we can’t do an exact comparison. But looking at the plans offered, we found potentially much higher health insurance costs for federal workers, depending on which plan and what level of coverage an employee wants. But we found a far less significant gap -- and some federal advantages -- on retirement benefits. So, Duffy’s statement is generally accurate but leaves out important details. That puts his statement at Half True.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2011-04-12T09:00:00	2011-02-23	['None']
pomt-11584	"New York has the third lowest rate of gun-caused death in America."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/01/brian-kavanagh/rate-gun-caused-deaths-ny-among-lowest-country/	State Sen. Brian Kavanagh claimed New York state has one of the lowest gun death rates in the country. "New York has the third-lowest rate of gun-caused death in America," Kavanagh said. Kavanagh, a Democrat who represents the Brooklyn waterfront and Lower Manhattan, has introduced legislation that would allow a judge to temporarily restrict someone’s gun rights. Family members or law enforcement officials could ask for such an order for those they believe to be a danger to themselves or others. Kavanagh said his bill would make New York state an even safer place to live. But is he right that the state already ranks third lowest in gun-caused deaths? Data on gun deaths The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks firearm mortality by state each year. The data includes suicides, homicides and accidental gun deaths. New York state reported that 4.4 of every 100,000 residents died from gun-related causes in 2016. Only Rhode Island and Massachusetts had lower rates. Massachusetts was lowest, with 3.4 gun-related deaths for every 100,000 residents. Alaska had the highest gun death rate, with 23.3 of every 100,000 people dying from gun-related causes in 2016. New York state reported 900 gun deaths in 2016, the 17th highest number in the country. Texas had the most, with 3,353 such deaths. What’s in the data? More than half of those who died from gun-related causes in New York state took their own life in 2016. The state reported 490 suicides. That said, New York had the third-lowest rate of suicidal gun deaths -- 2.5 for every 100,000 residents. Montana had 15.5 suicide gun deaths for every 100,000 residents, the highest in the country. New York state ranked higher in gun homicides. About two out of every 100,000 people were killed by a firearm assault in New York state in 2016. Seven states had lower rates, and six other states had so few gun homicides that the CDC considered their calculated death rates unreliable. Our ruling Kavanagh said "New York has the third-lowest rate of gun-caused death in America." Government figures confirm Kavanagh’s claim. Only two other states rank lower than New York state in gun deaths. New York state also ranks third lowest in suicidal gun deaths, though the state’s rank climbs when assaults are considered alone.

pomt-00149	Says images show migrants on trains and buses heading toward the United States, not walking.	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/24/viral-image/viral-facebook-post-uses-old-images-falsely-claim-/	A post on a Facebook group called "Drain the Swamp" uses old images to falsely claim that they show migrants currently traveling in a caravan toward the United States. "They don't want you to see this... THEY ARE NOT WALKING!! Why are the reporters hiding the fact that the migrants are coming on trains, buses, and trucks? These are not Mexican buses…," said an Oct. 22 post that’s been shared more than 85,000 times. One of the images shows dozens of men on top of a train and the other shows more than a dozen people scattered outside coach buses. None of those photos accurately depict the current caravan but are actually from 2013 and earlier this year. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo of men atop a train was taken by Eduardo Verdugo for the Associated Press in April 2013 to illustrate the risks some migrants take to get to the United States. A photo slideshow — which includes an image being shared now — said migrants riding on top of trains became vulnerable targets for kidnapping gangs, cartel operatives and corrupt Mexican officials. The other image of people outside coach buses is credited to Jose Castanares and taken for AFP/Getty Images in April of this year, when another migrant caravan was enroute to the United States. A caption for that photo says the caravan of migrants was in Mexico and that it began breaking up "after abandoning its plan to travel en masse to the United States." News reports in April did say some migrants were traveling in buses to the Mexico-U.S. border. "While political pressure over the caravan mounted north of the border, in Mexico the migrants continued their journey. … Sometimes they stowed away aboard freight trains. Sometimes they rode chartered buses. Sometimes they walked, carrying crosses and protest signs," CNN reported about the April caravan. This time around, some migrants in the caravan are also coming in trucks and other vehicles, but most of them appear to be walking. This also isn’t something reporters are hiding — there are plenty of pictures and videos documenting their travel. Our ruling Viral images posted on a Facebook group claim to show migrants on trains and buses heading toward the United States, not walking. The photos shared to support the claim are from 2013 and from April, and do not show the current caravan. There are some people in the current caravan traveling in trucks, but photos show that most are on foot. We rate the post as False.

pomt-01971	President Barack Obama "is the first president to keep a dog-trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/18/chain-email/does-obama-have-dog-trainer-retainer-102000-year-t/	Readers recently forwarded us an email that’s been making the rounds for several years. Because it appears to have returned to heavy rotation, we decided to do a few fact checks from among its dozens of claims, all of which are critical of President Barack Obama. Here, we’ll check the claim that Obama is paying a pretty penny in taxpayer money -- specifically $102,000 a year -- to keep a dog trainer on retainer. The White House didn't respond to our inquiry, but we were able to piece the story together on our own. Presidents have a long history of family pets, dating all the way back to George Washington, who kept dogs, horses and even a parrot. During his presidency, Theodore Roosevelt housed enough animals to run a small petting zoo on the south lawn, including 13 horses, six dogs, several cats, and even such exotic animals as a zebra. The Obama White House is certainly pet-friendly, but a little more tame: The Obamas have two Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., gave Bo as a gift to the Obamas in 2009 (fulfilling one of the newly inaugurated president’s campaign promises), and Sunny joined in August 2013. It’s obvious that the family adores Bo, but do they spend more than $100,000 per year to have a dog handler at their beck and call? Suggestions that the Obamas were spending lavishly on Bo circulated at least as far back as 2010. That’s when bloggers claimed that Bo had flown solo to Maine in a private jet when the family took a trip there, based on an article in a local newspaper, the Morning Sentinel, which had reported that Bo had arrived "in a small jet before the Obamas" along with "the president's personal aide, Reggie Love." We and others debunked the claim that Bo flew on his own airplane. In reality, the airport in Waterville, Maine, could not accommodate Obama’s usual airplane, so Obama and his staff flew into a different airport on separate jets, one of which carried several members of Obama’s presidential staff and Bo. The Sentinel later issued a correction: "Today's story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obamas' dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers." But this wasn’t enough to stop pieces of the rumor from morphing into another outrageous claim about Bo. Some of these rumors focused on Love, who holds a job known informally as the presidential "body man" -- a position that combines aspects of scheduler, valet, and conversational partner. Love began to work for Obama in 2006 and served as the president’s personal aide from 2009 until 2011. That meant that he was at Obama’s side almost constantly. Because the Morning Sentinel listed Love as Bo’s one and only traveling companion, some bloggers incorrectly assumed (or willfully spread the fiction) that his job was "dog trainer." Meanwhile, a 2011 report to Congress confirmed that Love was paid $102,000 a year. Love’s salary matches that listed in the chain email. But Love was far from a dog trainer. His job was to provide any necessary personal assistance and arrangements for the leader of the Free World. The notion that Obama was keeping a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year is nonsense. In tracking Bo’s history, we did find references to one trainer, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, who trained the dog before his introduction to the presidential lifestyle. Sylvia-Stasiewicz was known for training dogs who lived among Washington’s politicians, including Kennedy’s family, who took Bo to her before giving the dog to the Obamas. According to the Washington Post, the Kennedy’s worked with Sylvia-Stasiewicz to determine "whether the dog would be suitable for a very busy family with two young daughters." By her own admission, Sylvia-Stasiewicz was unaware that the dogs’ final destination would be the White House. However, according to the "Annual Reports to Congress on White House Staff," she was never paid by the Obama administration. Our Ruling The chain email said that "Obama is the first president to keep a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense." The claim stitches together a few pieces of accurate information in a way that makes them inaccurate. A dog trainer, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, has been associated with Bo, but she was used briefly and was never paid by the administration. Meanwhile, Reggie Love was an Obama aide who earned $102,000, but to the extent that dog handling took any of his time, it was a small fraction of his total duties, and "dog handler" certainly wasn’t his title.

pomt-11892	"There are parks in Southeast Raleigh that still don’t have air conditioning in the gym"	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/oct/25/charles-francis/democrat-running-mayor-says-southeast-raleigh-gyms/	Charles Francis says Raleigh isn’t spending its parks money fairly. Francis, a Democrat, is running for mayor of Raleigh against three-time incumbent Nancy McFarlane, who’s unaffiliated. They’re in a runoff after none of the three candidates – Francis, McFarlane and Republican Paul Fitts – secured the 50 percent of the vote required to win. (McFarlane got 48 percent, Francis got 36 percent and Fitts got 12 percent) In a debate Friday, Francis suggested the city shouldn’t focus all of its energy on Dix Park when more basic needs go unaddressed. Dix Park is a 308-acre property just south of downtown Raleigh that the city bought from the state in 2014 and plans to develop into a "destination" recreation spot. "It’s not right that there are parks in Southeast Raleigh that still don’t have air conditioning in the gym," he said. "We’ve got to have equity in the way we approach our parks." Southeast Raleigh, the city’s lone predominantly black area, hasn’t enjoyed the same economic success as other areas of the city where businesses are opening and property values are rising. Francis grew up there and is campaigning on the idea that the city should be doing more for the area. A recent PolitiFact analysis of the Oct. 10 election showed Francis got his most fervent support in Southeast Raleigh. And he has previously talked about how those voters could swing the election. "There are 80,000 black voters in Raleigh," Francis said at a forum in September. "McFarlane normally wins with 25,000 to 30,000 votes. If only a quarter of African-American voters vote – and vote the right way – we’re going to win." Given the city's budget is $919 million, PolitiFact wondered whether there are, indeed, gyms in Southeast Raleigh that don’t have air conditioning. What we found Turns out, the city controls 23 gyms at 19 venues. And yes, there are three gyms in southeast Raleigh that don’t have air-conditioning units, according to Raleigh’s parks, recreation and cultural resources department. Biltmore Hills Park, John Chavis Memorial Park and Tarboro Road Park are all located in southeast Raleigh and lack air conditioning units. But that’s not the whole story. There are six other Raleigh gyms that also lack air-conditioning. The gyms at Green Road Park, Lions Park in northeast Raleigh, Method Community Park in west Raleigh, Millbrook Exchange Park in north Raleigh and two gyms at Laurel Hills Park in northwest Raleigh also lack air conditioning. Most area gyms have AC There are also four gyms in the Southeast Raleigh area that do have air conditioning: Barwell Road Community Center, Halifax Community Center, Roberts Park Community Center and the Worthdale Community Center. The city says it didn’t begin putting air-conditioned gyms in park facilities until 2006. It costs about $300,000 to install units in older facilities. The city says its budget for capital projects will fund air-conditioning units in eight of the nine AC-less gyms by 2022. Method Park, the lone outlier, is being considered for AC funding as part of the 2023 budget, the city says. Our ruling Francis said gyms in Southeast Raleigh don't have air conditioning. There are four area gyms that have it and six gyms elsewhere in the city that don't have it.

pomt-05689	"It costs about $40,000 a year for a homeless person to be on the streets."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/12/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-says-homeless-person-costs-taxpayers/	The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development upped its cool quotient when Secretary Shaun Donovan appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Donovan and Stewart exchanged small talk about growing up in New York City before turning to the topic of homelessness. "The thing we finally figured out is that it’s actually, not only better for people, but cheaper to solve homelessness than it is to put a band-aid on it," Donovan said in the March 5, 2012, appearance. "Because, at the end of the day, it costs, between shelters and emergency rooms and jails, it costs about $40,000 a year for a homeless person to be on the streets." Stewart then mentioned the costs of mental health services for homeless, who suffer a high rate of mental illness. Here, we’re looking at whether Donovan presented an accurate dollar figure. A word on ‘housing first’ By emphasizing the high cost of leaving homeless people on the street, Donovan is reflecting a movement among homeless advocates and governments toward a model called "housing first." Pioneered in the 1990s in New York City, it puts street dwellers in publicly subsidized rooms of their own and connects them with drug treatment, job placement and psychiatric services with the goal of stabilizing their lives. Unlike many treatment programs, housing-first initiatives don’t require participants to get sober first. "Housing first is a kind of ‘come as you are’ approach. We encourage folks to accept services, and as a result people change their behaviors," said Brenda Rosen, executive director of Common Ground, a housing-first homelessness program in New York City. The approach succeeds and saves money, advocates say, because it targets the chronically homeless -- those who have been homeless for a year or more and commonly suffer from addiction or mental illness. That segment of the homeless population uses expensive public services at very high rates -- emergency rooms, police and fire, and courts. 2002 study Donovan’s office pointed to a study by University of Pennsylvania researcher Dennis Culhane titled "Public Service Reductions Associated with Placement of Homeless Persons with Severe Mental Illness in Supportive Housing." Culhane analyzed the costs of 4,679 mentally ill homeless people in New York City who were placed in supportive housing that also provided social services. Those costs were compared to data on people who relied on public shelters, public and private hospitals and correctional facilities. Culhane found that "persons placed in supportive housing experience marked reductions in shelter use, hospitalizations, length of stay per hospitalization and time incarcerated. Before placement, homeless people with severe mental illness used about $40,451 per person per year in services (1999 dollars). Placement was associated with a reduction in services use of $16,281 per housing unit per year." This study is a decade old (the dollar figures are 13 years old), and it examined a subgroup of homeless people -- those with severe mental disabilities -- who need more services and thus have a higher cost of care. Donovan’s statement didn’t make that distinction; he just said ‘a homeless person.’ What else? Plenty of other studies have attempted to determine the cost of homelessness, although with different variables such as city, age, addiction history, employment history and childhood background. For example, the Economic Roundtable in Los Angeles looked at the costs of homelessness there and reached similar conclusions. The 2009 study "Where We Sleep: The Costs of Housing and Homelessness in Los Angeles," which followed 10,193 homeless individuals, found that the typical public cost for services for residents in supportive housing was $605 a month. For the homeless the cost was $2,897. The rate of $2,897 per month totals about $35,000 a year. "This remarkable finding demonstrates that practical, tangible public benefits result from providing supportive housing for vulnerable homeless individuals," the researchers wrote. For guidance on this story, we talked to Philip Mangano, the former homelessness policy czar under President George W. Bush. Mangano helped expand housing-first programs -- with federal dollars behind them -- into cities around the country. As the programs became established, Mangano said he was able to compile data from 65 cities looking at all services affected by homelessness. Hospitals, police and courts top the list. Chronically homeless people are regular visitors to emergency rooms, and each visit results in a hefty bill. They also frequently use mental health and addiction treatment services. They tend to rack up lots of arrests, leading to costly jail stays and use of court time. "They randomly ricochet through very expensive services, Mangano said. Mangano even looked at the impact on libraries, finding that many of them had to hire extra security to handle homeless loiterers. Using data from the 65 cities -- of all different sizes and demographics -- the cost of keeping people on the street added up to between $35,000 and $150,000 per person per year, Mangano said. Conversely, after the housing-first programs had been established, Mangano said, he looked at the cost of keeping formerly homeless people housed. That range: $13,000 to $25,000 per person per year. "We learned that you could either sustain people in homelessness for $35,000 to $150,000 a year, or you could literally end their homelessness for $13,000 to $25,000 a year," he said. Why does it work? Rosen said housing people eliminates risk factors related to sleeping on the street, such as exposure to harsh temperatures and unhealthy drug habits that go untreated. Supportive housing, by contrast, provides a healthy environment. "Not only do you have support services on site, we build beautiful buildings and beautiful apartments," she said. "You bring somebody inside, and you help restore their dignity. The support services that we offer help folks decrease their reliance on drugs. If they have mental health issues, they see a psychiatrist. And oftentimes their behavior is changed." Our ruling Donovan said it costs the public $40,000 for a homeless person to be on the streets because of the expenses of emergency room visits, jail time and hospital stays. He drew that figure from a 10-year-old study that wasn’t looking at the general homeless population but at people with severe mental illness -- a group that uses more services. The study also focused on New York City, an expensive place to live. Though Stewart and Donovan had been talking about growing up in New York shortly before, it wasn't clear that Donovan was referring only to New York when he noted the costs of homelessness. But based on what we learned about the housing-first approach to ending homelessness, Donovan’s underlying point, as well as the dollar figure he cited, hold up. Mangano told us it costs between $35,000 to $150,000 in public services for one year of someone living on the street. That puts Donovan’s figure at the low end of the range, and it’s an outdated figure that would surely be higher now. All that leads us to a ruling of Mostly True.

pomt-08659	Says Texas U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions said the GOP's goal is to "go back to the same exact policies that were in place before this president took office... policies that crashed the economy."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/14/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-us-rep-pete-sessions-called-goi/	White House adviser David Axelrod singled out a Texas congressman's comment in July--ages ago in Washington time--to suggest American voters will not rebuff ruling Democrats come November. In an interview aired Sept. 8 on National Public Radio's Morning Edition, Axelrod said: "Pete Sessions, the head of the Republican campaign committee, said a few weeks ago that their goal is to go back to the same exact policies that were in place before this president took office. Let's remember: Those were the policies that crashed the economy; we lost 4 million jobs in the last six months of the last administration, the middle class flat-lined for that decade, special interests ran wild. and these are the very policies that they want to return to." Did U.S. Rep. Sessions champion a return to policies that battered the economy? We sought the skinny on both parts of Axelrod's slam of Sessions, focusing on what Sessions said and the policies at issue. The White House told us Axelrod was referring to a Sessions' comment on the July 18 edition of NBC's Meet the Press featuring Democratic and Republican leaders of U.S. House and Senate campaign committee including Sessions, the Dallas Republican who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is intent on Republicans capturing a House majority. According to a transcript of the show, host David Gregory said to Sessions: "This has been a debate so far this morning about, you know, the relative merits of Republican rule during the (George W.) Bush years and what this president (Barack Obama) has or has not accomplished so far. I think what a lot of people want to know is if Republicans do get back into power, what are they going to do?" Sessions replied that the country needs to live within its means and lawmakers need to read legislation before acting on it. Gregory pressed for detail. Sessions said: "We need to make sure that we allow employers, which was in that 52-page report that was presented to the president of the United States by CEOs in this country, we need to go back to the exact same agenda that is empowering the free enterprise system rather than diminish it." After the program, spokeswoman Jennifer Crider of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pounced, saying Sessions and another Republican on the show, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, "hammered home that the Republican plan for the future is exactly the same Bush Administration plan that got us into the economic mess in the first place." In response, Ken Spain, the NRCC's spokesman, said Sessions was referring to a June 2010 report by the Business Roundtable criticizing Obama's policies as anti-business. Spain told us in an e-mail: "The White House is deliberately mischaracterizing Chairman Sessions' remarks." Sessions did not respond to our inquiries about what he said or meant by his comment. Meantime, when we asked the White House to elaborate on which policies Axelrod thinks Sessions called to restore, spokesman Matt Lehrich pointed us to news articles in The New York Times looking back at the roots of the economic crisis that resulted in congressional approval of a Wall Street rescue package in the fall of 2008. An Oct. 2, 2008 Times article, headlined "Agency's '04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt," singles out an April 2004 vote by the Securities and Exchange Commission making it easier for huge Wall Street investment banks to take on more debt--a decision reversed during the 2008 crisis only after commission staff failed to review the banks' rapid accumulation of debt, instead trusting banks to protect themselves against debt-driven disaster. A Dec. 20, 2008 Times article, headlined "White House Philosophy Stoked Mortgage Bonfire," says that many culprits were to blame for the economic crisis, including President Bush's "belief that Americans do best when they own their own home with his conviction that markets do best when let alone," encouraging lax lending standards. The story says: "As early as 2006, top advisers to Mr. Bush dismissed warnings from people inside and outside the White House that housing prices were inflated and that a foreclosure crisis was looming. And when the economy deteriorated, Mr. Bush and his team misdiagnosed the reasons and scope of the downturn; as recently as February, for example, Mr. Bush was still calling it a 'rough patch.' The result was a series of piecemeal policy prescriptions that lagged behind the escalating crisis." The story quotes a Bush aide saying the president looked back and said: ""We absolutely wanted to increase homeownership. But we never wanted lenders to make bad decisions." Interesting hindsights, but relevant to interpreting Sessions? Hard to tell. Next, we turned to the June report by the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies, to see if its text fits with Sessions' statement to NBC that we "need to go back to the exact same agenda." Titled "Policy Burdens Inhibiting Economic Growth," the report covers topics including energy, the environment, financial regulatory reform, taxes, trade and health care reform. Its executive summary identifies "key regulatory issues that are impeding economic growth and job recovery," such as proposals mulled by the Obama administration to raise taxes on foreign earnings and enable unions to organize via secret-ballot elections. The report also raises concerns about the financial regulatory reform legislation which passed Congress in July largely in response to the economic crash. Among the new rules it objects to are those restricting the derivatives market and making it easier for shareholders to nominate directors to corporate boards. Notably, the Business Roundtable's position on those ideas fill less than three pages in the report, which over all advocates a traditional big-business agenda: reducing corporate tax rates, making permanent a research and development tax break; moving forward on pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea; reconsidering the moratorium on deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico; and immigration reform that cleans up a backlog in legal hirings of Chinese and Indian employees. Finally, an online search shows that Sessions told a Dallas group this month that to juice the economy, he favors ending capital gains' taxes, permitting businesses to write off investments "quickly on a permanent basis" and reducing corporate income tax rate to 12.5 percent--proposals in step with traditional conservative GOP ideas, though not implicated in the 2008 crash. (Would that he'd been that precise on NBC.) And how does Axelrod’s statement hold up? Kind of like Sessions’ July statement, with both falling short of clarity about what Sessions wants back. It's reasonable to speculate Sessions wants a return to relaxed oversight of the nation's finance sector. But there's not enough evidence to rate Axelrod's statement more than Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00033	Refugees are throwing rocks and trying "to kill you."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/05/blog-posting/viral-image-supposedly-depicting-caravan-members-r/	Though the so-called "migrant caravan" isn’t expected to reach the U.S.-Mexico border until late November, efforts are well underway to sow fears that the people seeking refuge in the United States are violent, disrespectful and entitled. A recent submission to this anthology suggests that the migrants fleeing Central America are coming to get you. "All we want is a better life in your country," starts one Facebook post that appeared on Nov. 2. "So we’re going to throw rocks and try to kill you." The text frames an image of about a couple dozen men in what looks like a dusty melee. Some of the men have their arms in the air, and several seem to be throwing something. "Dixon Diaz 2018" appears to be written in the bottom left corner. "To a liberal, its (sic) ok for poor people seeking refuge from violence to throw rocks at you," the The Snarky Conservative 2, which posted the image, commented. Some members of the migrant caravan have thrown rocks at the Guatemala-Mexico border, according to news reports. They also threw sticks during a standoff with Mexican police on Oct. 28, according to the Associated Press, a clash that left one migrant dead from a head wound, though the cause was unclear. On Nov. 1, President Donald Trump said he had told the military that troops should react to any rocks migrants throw at them as if they were rifles. But, the AP reports, "while some migrants have clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the Guatemala border, most of those traveling with the caravans have been peaceful and say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home." "We are not killers," the wire service quotes Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran woman, as saying. The photo used in this Facebook post also does not show migrants throwing rocks. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Snopes noted in a 2016 fact-check that the "Snarky Conservative" is the creation of blogger Dixon Diaz—the name seemingly signed on the photo with a 2018 date. But a reverse Google image search turns up results related to the First Intifada in 1987, when Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip rioted following the death of four Palestinian workers. Because the Palestinians were largely unarmed, the BBC reported 20 years after the revolt, "the enduring picture of the intifada is one of young men and boys throwing stones and rocks at Israeli troops." In a 2017 NISA journal article, Jeremy Pressman writes that throwing rocks was central to the intifada’s identity and definition. "Stone-throwing was the most visible tactic Palestinians used in the first intifada." The image appears on several blogs, though information about the photo, including the name of photographer, is missing. A website called torahcode.us includes the photo in an undated post about the intifada with the caption: "Palestinian youths throwing rocks during the Intifada." An undated timeline of the Arab-Israeli conflict posted on Timetoast.com, which lets users create timelines online, uses the image to illustrate "The First Intifada" in 1987. Other websites where the photo is posted also show that it predates the migrant caravan. It was included in a slideshow of pictures attributed to the intifada on this WordPress blog—"Palestina en el corazon," by Maria Landi—in December 2017. A reverse image search on TinEye.com shows that the first time the image search and recognition site found the image online was in 2008, when it was used as part an entry on Inciclopedia.wikia.com, a free Spanish-language online encyclopedia like Wikipedia. The caption for that image, when translated from Spanish, is: "Squadron 202 of the special forces of the Mexican army making use of its sophisticaed weapons." But when you click on the image’s file history, it says the image is named "Palestinianyouth2www.jpg" and was created in March 2007. Our ruling Though the photo is widely used in connection with the intifada, we couldn’t find any news reports or retrospectives that featured the image with an official caption or credited to a photographer or publication. However, it’s clear that it’s been around since at least the mid-2000s, and its grainy quality suggests it’s even older. And what’s more, no credible outlets link it to the Central American migrants seeking refuge in the United States. We rate this claim Pants on Fire! Correction and update (Nov. 8, 2018): The Facebook user who posted this meme goes by the name The Snarky Conservative 2. In an earlier version of this post, we linked to a different account. The story has been updated. This post also has been updated with news reports saying some members of the migrant caravan have thrown rocks at the Guatemala-Mexico border.

pomt-01844	"Providence graduation rates are up."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/16/angel-taveras/mayor-angel-taveras-says-high-school-graduation-ra/	A June 25, 2014, campaign commercial for Providence Mayor Angel Taveras’ gubernatorial campaign focuses on the importance of education in improving Rhode Island’s economy. In the first few seconds of the video, Taveras is shown talking to a teacher in a classroom. "Getting Rhode Island’s economy to succeed begins here, in our schools," a narrator says. "Angel Taveras understands. He went from Head Start to Harvard. As mayor, he worked to lift up our schools. Graduation rates are up, and Providence won a national award for innovative ideas in early learning." We know that schools in Providence and the state’s other urban communities have higher dropout rates than schools in wealthier communities. We wondered whether graduation rates in Providence had actually gone up -- and, if so, how much Taveras had to do with it. The Taveras campaign directed us to the Providence Public School Department’s report on 2013 Graduation Rates. Based on data from the Rhode Island Department of Education, the report, issued on May 18, 2014, lists graduation rates for the past five graduating classes. The rates for graduation in four years are: 2009: 66.5 percent 2010: 68.3 percent 2011: 66.1 percent 2012: 65.5 percent 2013: 71.4 percent As the report notes, the 71.4 percent graduation rate for the class of 2013 "is the highest rate for the past five years." (The 2014 rate is not yet available.) And, in 2012-2013, all of the city’s 10 high schools (eight district schools and two public charters) except for Classical and Mount Pleasant experienced a one-year increase. Classical - the largest of the 10 - dipped by 1.1 percent to 96.1 percent. Mount Pleasant’s rate dipped by 1.6 percentage points to 57.4. Taveras took office in January 2011, halfway through the school year. So during his years in office, through 2013, the four-year graduation rate jumped nearly 6 percentage points. A slam dunk for Taveras, right? Well, there are some caveats. First, Providence’s 2013 graduation rate of 71.4 percent is still lower than the district’s own goal -- 73 percent. And it’s substantially lower than the statewide average of 79.7 percent. And two city high schools -- Central and Mount Pleasant -- continue to lag even further behind. Mount Pleasant’s rate, as we’ve noted, was only 57.4 percent in 2012-2013. Central’s 2013 rate did jump by more than 7 percentage points from the previous year, but it was still only 63.6 percent. And finally, how much credit can the mayor, who took office in January 2011, take for the graduation rate increases? In Providence, the mayor does have more influence over the school system than mayors or town managers in other communities. The Providence mayor appoints school board members (subject to City Council approval). In most other communities, they are elected. The school committee retains administrators, including the superintendent. Taveras spokeswoman Dawn Bergantino said improved graduation rates "don’t happen overnight and are due to the hard work of many - teachers, students, community organizations and others - who are committed to the success of Providence’s young people." She also cited programs put in place under the mayor, for example, expanding participation in the school meals program and negotiating a slightly longer school day in the last teachers’ contract. We also asked Providence Schools Supt. Susan Lusi, who was appointed by the school board during Taveras’ administration, for her insight. Acknowledging the stagnant low rates at Mount Pleasant, and Central’s low (but improving) graduation rates, "we have work to do in the district," she said. "But I think we are all happy to see the data moving in the right direction, and it definitely is. There are some things we have done that will take more time to show up in the graduation rates." That includes the "Graduate Providence" campaign that she and Taveras have led, starting in 2012, that involved visits "to every high school," and meetings with parents regarding the state’s graduation requirements. Guidance counselors, administrators and teachers "met with every student regarding where they were vis a vis meeting these graduation requirements," and schools and families signed off on plans. Numerous academic supports were put in place, as well as work with community partners, she said. Lusi also noted that dropout rates have been steadily declining. (They dropped from 16.9 percent to 12.2 percent between 2012 and 2013). TIm Duffy, executive director of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, said, "I think the numbers bear out that Providence has improved its graduation rate; clearly they are moving in the right direction." Duffy noted that the five-year graduation rates and other alternative plans "have adapted to allow students to go [graduate] at a pace that suits the individual student a little bit more." Our ruling A campaign video for Angel Taveras says "Providence graduation rates are up." Indeed, rates have risen nearly 6 percentage points since Taveras took office. Did Taveras have a role in the increase, as the ad clearly implies? He has taken some steps to boost graduation rates, but he’s been in office only three and a half years -- a caveat not mentioned in the shorthand of a 30-second video. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03487	Says Gov. Rick Scott returned "$1 million in federal funding that would have helped the state cover the cost of overseeing insurance rates under the new health care law."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jun/11/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-rick-scott-returned-1-million-gra/	Sen. Bill Nelson did not have high hopes when he pressured Gov. Rick Scott to veto an insurance regulation bill that Nelson said could harm consumers. Nelson, a Democrat who used to be the state’s insurance commissioner, asked Scott to veto SB 1842, which prevents state regulators from reviewing rate hikes for new plans in 2014 and 2015 as the federal health care law is implemented. "Given the governor’s recent decision to return $1 million in federal funding that would have helped the state cover the cost of overseeing insurance rates under the new health care law, and the fact that he has not even applied for another $5 million in federal funding that is available to help states control their insurance markets, I’m not holding my breath," he wrote in an op-ed. As Nelson predicted, Scott signed the bill. "Rates for new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating the new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period," Scott wrote in a message. In Nelson’s view, Scott and Republican legislators are setting up the federal government to take the fall for increased rates. His column left us wondering whether Scott really rejected $1 million for overseeing insurance rate hikes. Scott didn’t want fed money The task blasted us back to 2011, when the novice politician took office on a tea party-infused platform against Obamacare and big government. He and Republican leaders made a name for Florida by spurning million-dollar grants for the health care law despite having one of the highest uninsured populations and a $3.7 billion budget hole in 2011-12. State leaders yearned for the law to be overturned or repealed, and their hopes heightened when a federal district judge in Pensacola ruled the law unconstitutional shortly after Scott took office. Scott explained to the New York Times in July 2011 that it did not make sense to "waste either federal money or state money on something that’s unconstitutional." We found news accounts saying Scott ordered state agencies to reject health care money. We could not turn up such a directive via public record requests, but we found lots of evidence of Scott talking about rejecting health care money. Among the grants Florida rejected: $8.3 million for a community health center, $4.2 million for moving long-term care patients out of nursing homes, $2.8 million for prevention of teen pregnancy and STDs, $1 million for insurance exchange planning grants and, yes, $1 million for beefing up reviews of insurance premium increases. "Things that are simply implementing the Affordable Health Care Act, or Obamacare, I’m not going to support because I believe this: It’s the biggest job killer in our state, we can’t afford it and it’s going to be bad for patients," Scott said in a 2011 AP story. Scott elaborated on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal. The grant Now let’s get into the rate review grant, among the smaller grants the feds tried to award Florida to prepare for the health care law. The health care law set aside $250 million over five years to help states beef up their scrutiny of rate hike requests. Under the law, any double-digit proposed rate increase by individual or small group market insurers must be closely examined "to make sure it is justified." Florida intended to use its $1 million award to expand its rate review coverage to large group and out-of-state companies; create new premium filing requirements; hire more actuaries; and make it easier for consumers to search premium increase filings on the state insurance regulators’ website. (Read a summary of Florida’s application here.) The state got the money in August 2010, when Florida’s governor was Charlie Crist. In an acceptance letter, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty wrote, "The Office looks forward to our collaboration with the Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight as we move forward to use the grant funds to enhance the rate review process in Florida." McCarty addressed the letter to Jay Angoff, director of the federal Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight within the Department of Health and Human Services. McCarty made personal touches to the letter, crossing out the typed "Director Angoff" and writing "Jay." At the bottom, he scrawled, "Great to visit with you in Vermont!" McCarty’s next letter to Angoff on the subject on Feb. 1, 2011, lacked congeniality and an explanation. It came after the November 2010 elections that saw Crist out of office and Scott in, and after a Florida district judge ruled that the health care law was unconstitutional (the judge, Roger Vinson, said states should keep implementing the law because the matter would be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court). McCarty’s letter contained two sentences: "The purpose of this letter is to inform you that after deliberate consideration, I hereby rescind acceptance of the above-referenced $1 million rate review grant, which occurred in a letter to you dated September 15, 2010. No drawdown of any of the $1 million will occur." Angoff, who left his post at HHS in December 2012 to work for the D.C. law firm Mehri Skalet, told us the change of heart did not surprise him "once it became clear that many of the Republicans were just so maniacally opposed to cooperating with the Affordable Care Act." Florida, Idaho and Oklahoma were the only states to return rate review grants, and four others did not apply. What changed? We were left with simple questions: Why did OIR return the money, and who ordered it? Let’s start from the top -- of the rejection letter’s masthead. McCarty’s office is overseen by the Financial Services Commission, a four-person body comprised of the governor and Cabinet. The 2010 election kicked out moderate-to-liberal members Crist and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink and ushered in Scott and three anti-Obama Republicans. McCarty, who took over for Nelson as commissioner in 2003, is appointed by the commission. Asked directly if Scott rejected the grant or told McCarty to return it, both the governor’s office and Office of Insurance Regulation sidestepped the question. Spokesmen initially sent a 2010 letter from then-House Speaker Dean Cannon to Crist regarding agencies implementing the federal health care law without "waiting for clear and comprehensive guidance from the Legislature." Cannon’s greatest concern was the Office of Insurance Regulation. The federal government was "commandeering" the office, he wrote, which was was developing a system for enforcing new regulations. "Although OIR used routine budget mechanisms to commence these actions with federal grant money, the substantive actions must be subject to more thorough legislative scrutiny," he wrote. Cannon told agencies to submit a detailed list of activities related to the health care law and not to take any more actions to implement the law after Nov. 15, 2010. He did not say OIR needed to return the grant. OIR spokeswoman Amy Bogner sent us a vague statement that did not explain the reason: "The Office had the authority to draw down funds. The Office did not draw down the funds. The Office was not directed to take this action. We do not have any further comment." We searched news clips. The grant did not generate much attention at the time, often lopped in with more expensive ones. McCarty was quoted by the Tampa Bay Business Journal as saying part of the reason he rescinded acceptance of the grant was the federal government’s criticism of a Connecticut regulator approving a rate increase of as much as 47 percent. "We hadn’t drawn down the money, we were concerned about its encroachment on state sovereignty, and yesterday’s decision just made it a cinch," McCarty said in the April 1, 2011 story, referring to the district judge’s ruling. Former Scott spokesman Lane Wright told us for a 2011 fact-check that the governor’s staff examined each grant to determine whether it was intended to implement health care reform. "Some grants were not applied for and some grants applied for under the Crist administration were returned because they were meant specifically for the implementation of Obamacare," Wright wrote. Listed as an example: the premium review grant. Our ruling Nelson said Scott returned "$1 million in federal funding that would have helped the state cover the cost of overseeing insurance rates under the new health care law." It is undeniable that a grant for that purpose in that amount was sought, and a grant was returned. But the official who technically returned the money was the state’s insurance commissioner, a political appointee who answers to Scott as part of his role on the Financial Services Commission. Still, he did so shortly after Scott took office and Scott’s office claimed some amount of credit back in 2011. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-08182	Red light camera installed to "promote public safety."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/29/city-atlanta/atlanta-wants-green-light-red-light-cameras/	(Want to discuss this ruling? Check out our Facebook page.) It's the one piece of mail that makes every motorist who has ever hit the gas at a yellow light cringe -- the letter saying you ran a red light with a picture to prove it. Atlanta officials recently announced one red light camera is coming back, at the busy intersection of Freedom Parkway and Boulevard. They "promote public safety," city officials said in a press release. Is that true? Critics argue red light cameras are nothing more than a moneymaking racket for government. Some researchers contend they don't make intersections any safer. State transportation officials earlier this year denied Atlanta's request to keep the camera at the intersection, saying they found little evidence that the device was reducing the grinding T-bone collisions that typically occur when motorists run a red light. "The crash data at the intersection, compared before and after the device was installed, did not reflect a reduction in the types of crashes caused by red light-running violators," Mark McKinnon, a state Department of Transportation spokesman, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent article. That doesn't mean the red light camera was unsafe, he said, just that it wasn't improving safety, which is its purpose. Red light cameras have been used for years in metro Atlanta in cities like Alpharetta, Duluth and Roswell. Several cities in Gwinnett County shut down the cameras in 2009 after noticing a decline in accidents and injuries, which they believed were associated with adding an extra second for yellow lights. In May, Atlanta's WXIA-TV investigated crash data at several city intersections with red-light cameras. The station found T-bone collisions increased at five of eight intersections with red light cameras. The city's Public Works Department asked the state to reconsider its plans to keep the camera at the intersection of Freedom Parkway and Boulevard. The city sent new data it believed showed better results for the camera. About 48,000 vehicles travel through Freedom Parkway and Boulevard each day, city officials say. The red light camera was initially put at the intersection in December 2007. There were 16 wrecks involving vehicles that ran red lights in the 24 months before the camera was installed, according to a study completed in June for the city by LAI Engineering. There were 15 such wrecks in the 24 months after the camera was installed, researchers found. The number of injury crashes in 2006 and 2007 were exactly the same (34) as there were in 2008 and 2009, the company found. None of the crashes in that four-year period were fatal. LAI Engineering said the camera needed to be there an additional two years to evaluate its effectiveness. Atlanta officials said they also would extend yellow light time at the intersection. In September, the state approved Atlanta's plan to reinstall the camera. "The fact that so many crashes are occurring indicates that some measure is needed for public safety," Atlanta Public Works Department spokeswoman Valerie Bell-Smith told AJC reporter Ariel Hart in a recent article. In 2009, nearly three-quarters of the accidents at that intersection were rear-end collisions. Some experts say that's common at intersections with red light cameras. The Virginia Transportation Research Council, a partnership between that state's Transportation Department and the University of Virginia, conducted a seven-year study of six cities and counties with and without red light cameras. The study found rear-end collisions increased by 27 percent at intersections with red light cameras. Red light-running crashes decreased by 42 percent, the research found. Overall, the number of crashes decreased in three of the six jurisdictions. "Common sense dictates that if the desired effect of red light cameras is achieved, there will be an increase in rear-end accidents," said a report released by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas). "This is because motorists fearing a ticket will panic and slam on their brakes to avoid entering an intersection." "Red light cameras aren’t fixing a safety problem, they’re creating one," the Armey report said. The Urban Transit Institute looked at crashes at red-light cameras in Greensboro, N.C., and found "large increases in rear-end collisions," but fewer accidents involving a vehicle turning left and a vehicle on the same roadway. Researchers concluded "there has been no demonstrable benefit from the RLC program in terms of safety. In many ways, the evidence points toward the installation of RLCs as a detriment to safety." Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel released an audit of that city's red-light camera program. Greuel's office found 12 of the 32 intersections with red-light cameras had more wrecks, four had about the same and 16 had fewer accidents. Studies in other places show red light cameras do not demonstrably improve safety at intersections. The study done for the city of Atlanta found no major difference in accidents since the red light camera was installed. Many researchers believe there is no major difference in accidents with red light cameras, but they do increase the fear factor among some motorists to slow down. The city's claim that the camera "promotes public safety" has some truth, but it leaves out important details, such as the typical rise in rear-end collisions. So motorists, beware when approaching a yellow light. Meanwhile, we rate Atlanta's claim as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	City of Atlanta	None	None	None	2010-11-29T06:00:00	2010-11-12	['None']

pomt-11515	"There are more guns in this country than there are people."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/20/kevin-nicholson/which-higher-number-people-or-number-guns-america/	Days after the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Republican Kevin Nicholson was asked about the shooting and whether anything should be done. Nicholson, who touts his support of the Second Amendment, is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. He appeared on the Feb. 18, 2018 edition of "UpFront with Mike Gousha," a Milwaukee-based public affairs TV show. Nicholson responded to the question, in part, with a statistical claim, saying: The reality is, we're a nation of 300-plus-million people. There are more guns in this country than there are people. If somebody wants to obtain a firearm to commit a crime -- a heinous crime, a disgusting crime like this that puts children in harm's way and ends up taking innocent life -- they're going to do it." Are there more guns than people in the United States? The estimates We found in our first fact check related to the shooting at the high school in Parkland, Fla., that bad numbers related to guns can spread fast. We rated as Mostly False a claim that there had already been 18 U.S. school shootings in 2018, but only 18 in the rest of the world over past 20 years. Hard numbers on the number of guns in the United States are also elusive. In the past few years, headlines in the Washington Post and on Vox have declared there are more guns than people in the United States. Both noted a surge of gun sales following the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. But the headlines suggest the figures are certain when they’re not, given that there is no record keeping that would produce an actual count of guns in the United States. As the Pew Research Center has observed: "Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down." At the same time, there have been studies to produce estimates on the number of civilian guns in the nation. Both the Post and Vox noted an estimate on the high end -- 310 million guns -- that was cited in a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report said the estimate was based on U.S. Department of Justice data and was the "total number of firearms available to civilians" as of 2009. That 310 million count is higher than the U.S. population in 2009 of about 305 million. But one gun-statistics expert, Philip Cook at Duke University, told the Post that the actual figure then was probably closer to 245 million guns, not 310 million, to take into account circumstances such as guns that break down or are lost or destroyed. And Cook and two other experts -- Tom Smith at the University of Chicago and Daniel Webster at the Johns Hopkins at the Center for Gun Policy and Research -- told us the best, most recent estimate is in a study published in October 2017 by researchers from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. A total of 3,949 adults, representative of the U.S. population, were surveyed online. The lead author of that study, Deborah Azrael, told us the respondents were asked if they owned guns and how many, and were instructed not to count BB guns, replicas or other guns that were not functioning. "There are clearly guns we miss," Azrael said, noting that some people might lie about owning guns. "My guess is we probably miss more than we undercount." The estimate: 265 million civilian guns in the United States, as of when the survey was taken, in January 2015. Meanwhile, the U.S. population at that time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was about 320 million. Other highlights of the Harvard study: Of the estimated 265 million total civilian guns, 113 million were handguns. The typical gun owner (the median, in the survey) owned two guns. 39 percent of the estimated 265 million guns were owned by 8 percent of the gun owners -- that 8 percent of all owners owned 10 or more guns. Prior fact check The claim made by Nicholson was also made in 2013 by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the District of Columbia. PolitiFact National, noting the lack of firm numbers, gave her a rating of Half True. That fits here. Our rating Nicholson says: "There are more guns in this country than there are people." There is no official count of the number of firearms in the United States. In one estimate, for 2009, the number of guns exceeded the population. But the most recent estimate cited by gun-statistics experts puts the figure at 265 million guns as of January 2015, when the population was 320 million. We rate Nicholson’s statement Half True.

pomt-13592	"Seventy percent of all Texans are overweight or obese."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/aug/17/baker-harrell/advocate-70-percent-texans-overweight-or-obese/	Something to weigh in advance of your next pile of nachos: "Seventy percent of all Texans are overweight or obese," the leader of a pro-health nonprofit said. Baker Harrell, chief executive officer of Austin-based It’s Time Texas, which says it focuses on preventing chronic disease, made the claim in an interview posted Aug. 15, 2016. A day later, after we inquired, the Texas Tribune amended its article to reflect what Harrell said he’d meant to say--that nearly 70 percent of Texas adults are overweight or obese. "I misspoke," Harrell told us by email. In the Tribune interview, Harrell otherwise elaborated: "Obesity is often discussed as the crisis. Obesity is actually a symptom of the crisis. It’s an important symptom, but it’s a symptom of the crisis. The crisis is that we have engineered health out of our daily lives, we’ve engineered it out of our communities, over the last 40 years." We wondered if someone engineered the 70 percent figure. By phone, Harrell told us he drew his percentage of hefty adults (and again, not children) from the results of a 2009 telephone survey of 10,971 Texas adults. The survey of health risk factors, annually commissioned by the Texas Department of State Health Services, found that 66.8 percent of Texas adults were overweight or obese that year, compared with 63.8 percent of adults nationwide: Source: 2009 Texas Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System, Center for Health Statistics, Department of State Health Services (accessed Aug. 16, 2016) The survey classified anyone with a body mass index of 25 or greater as overweight. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a BMI of 25 and above to be overweight and a BMI of 30 and above to be obese. BMI can be calculated by plugging a person’s height and weight into a chart like this one or you can run this equation: Weight in Pounds / ( Height in inches x Height in inches ) x 703. Generally, the index serves as an easy-to-measure gauge of someone’s risks of chronic disease and early death, the Harvard School of Public Health says on a web page about preventing obesity. Then again, the school says, the calculation doesn’t distinguish between body fat and lean body mass meaning some healthy people might have indexes in overweight territory--a point PolitiFact made in a 2007 fact check. For our part, we also examined up-to-date survey results. To our inquiry, Chris Van Deusen of State Health Services emailed the latest available results, for 2014; they indicate that among 14,058 Texas respondents self-reporting heights and weights, nearly 36 percent would be considered overweight with another nearly 32 percent having BMIs consistent with obesity. The 2014 total of 68 percent adults overweight or obese, Van Deusen said, was up from 66.2 percent of adults in the 2013 survey. Also in 2014, according to that year’s results, 61 percent of adult Texas women fell into the overweight-or-obese category--and a whopping 74 percent of men. According to a 2010 CDC presentation, the share of obese adults in Texas and numerous states has escalated dramatically: From 1989 through 1993, 10 percent to 14 percent of Texas adults had BMIs indicating obesity; from 2004 through 2009, in contrast, 25 percent to 29 percent of adults fit the category. The 32 percent adult obesity rate for Texas in 2014 placed the state 11th nationally among the states, according to an analysis pointed out by Harrell. The Trust for American Health, which says it’s dedicated to making disease prevention a national priority, lists Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi as nearly tied for worst in the nation with about 36 percent of adults having BMIs suggesting they were overweight or obese. And how about overweight and obese kids in Texas? Van Deusen noted that paper surveys taken by Texas high school students indicate that in the latest year of available results, 2013, less than a third of such students had BMIs indicating they were overweight or obese. We checked the agency’s posted results, which indicate 16 percent of students were obese, 16 percent were overweight. The state spokesman also pointed us to research involving younger children. According to results from the 2009-11 version of the School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) Survey, undertaken by the University of Texas School of Public Health, some 43 percent of the state’s fourth graders had BMIs indicating they were overweight or obese; so did 37 percent of 8th graders. Our ruling Harrell said 70 percent of all Texans are overweight or obese. Clarification’s needed here because 2014 survey results indicate that 68 percent of Texas adults (not all Texans) had BMIs suggesting they were overweight or obese. Adding in children drives down the percentage. We rate this since-amended statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-13972	Says Nevada lawmakers voted to allow teenaged boys to "shower with your teenaged girls in public school locker rooms."	false	/nevada/statements/2016/jun/13/nevada-assembly-republican-candidates/gop-campaign-mail-severely-distorts-complex-issue-/	Several Republican state Assembly hopefuls are using campaign mail pieces to try and tie Nevada lawmakers to the debate surrounding bathroom access for transgender students. One such ad by Assembly candidate Steve Sanson depicts Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson looming over a bathroom stall, with overlaid text reading: "Now teenaged boys can shower with your teenaged girls in public school locker rooms." Another from Assembly hopeful Blaine Jones depicts his primary opponent, Assemblyman Derek Armstrong, peering over a bathroom stall and implying that the Republican supports transgender bathrooms. Given recent headlines over bathroom access for transgender students, we thought it was worth checking into how Nevada deals with the issue. Legislative flashback Nevada lawmakers did tackle a bill in 2015 that would have required all students to use the bathroom that corresponded to their biological sex. After heated debate, Assembly members voted down the proposed bill with five Republicans (including freshman Armstrong, another mailer target) breaking rank and joining Democrats to defeat the measure. But the mailers themselves appear to be referring to another bill, SB504, which established a statewide anti-bullying program and was approved by all but a handful of legislators. The vast majority of that specific bill dealt with setting up a new statewide anti-bullying office and setting stricter requirements for reporting and investigating bullying. Several activists seized upon a 2015 legislative briefing released by the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom, which interpreted the new law as creating a "new right" for transgender students to access the bathrooms and shower rooms of their choice. In an endorsement letter, Assemblyman Ira Hansen said the new law "mandated every school district in Nevada make all facilities ‘gender neutral.’" But the law itself isn’t that clear-cut. A tangled legal web A mandate on bathroom access for transgender students is part of an ongoing legal debate that still doesn’t have a clear answer. UNLV law professor Ann McGinley says several federal courts have issued rulings indicating that transgender students fit under Title IX protections for gender equality, but any finality on a federal level will likely come from a future Supreme Court decision. McGinley says the question then falls to the state level, where the law is unclear. There’s nothing in state law that specifically mandates transgender students have the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with, but Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval’s office says the issue is essentially settled through the state’s broadly focused anti-discrimination laws. Lawmakers in 2011 expanded the state’s anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression. Because these "public accommodation" laws cover "place(s) of education," presumably school districts can’t segregate transgender students from using the gendered bathroom they identify with without violating state law. "No change in policy is necessary and the Obama administration has no need to have concerns about Nevada schools," Sandoval spokeswoman Mari St. Martin said in an earlier statement. So how does the anti-bullying bill — SB504 — fit into the debate? Nestled in the bill are several new definitions of bullying, including "blocking access to any property or facility of a school." The Alliance Defending Freedom brief uses that definition, along with the addition of gender identity or expression into classes protected by the legislation, to argue that it creates a "new right" for transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Sanson, one of the "insurgent Republicans" running against Anderson, referred to the ADF brief in several blog posts on his website, which also included letters from Assembly members Hansen and Shelly Shelton. "President Obama recently federally mandated all locker-rooms and bathrooms be designated ‘gender-neutral’, but it was already Nevada law because of Anderson’s leadership," Hansen said in a letter. Anderson called the brief "irrelevant" in an interview with PolitiFact. He said the legislation itself was designed to create general anti-bullying guidelines and that the bill’s language was left intentionally vague. "The goal was to create a vague definition so that school districts could apply their own policies," he said. "To spin it in any other way is frankly disingenuous," he added. McGinley says defining the law as creating a "new right" is probably too broad, but it’s possible the new anti-bullying legislation creates additional legal standing in the event a school district is challenged in court over their policies around transgender students. That’s similar to how the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to tackle the issue, according to the group’s policy director Holly Welborn. She said the ACLU has received several complaints related to transgender student bathroom access, but any lawsuit brought by the civil liberties group would likely stand on the already-existing public accommodation laws. "It (SB504) certainly isn’t creating a new right, it’s a right that already exists," Welborn said. Different statewide standards Transgender student access to bathrooms and other school facilities is largely dependent on individual policies of school districts. The Obama administration used transgender student policy of the Washoe County School District in Reno as an example of best practices for other school districts to follow. The district approved regulations last year allowing students to "use facilities that correspond to their gender identity as expressed by the student and asserted at school" including access to locker rooms. It’s a different case in the rural Elko County, where in 2015 one transgender student’s request to use male-designated school facilities was rejected by the local school board (requiring the student to use unisex bathrooms instead). Elko school district officials told a local newspaper that they interpreted the Obama administration’s letter as a "political statement" and would continue to make decisions on transgender student access on a case-by-case basis. But the vast majority of Nevada’s students are in the Clark County School District (in Las Vegas), which has yet to approve district-wide regulations for transgender students. The district circulated an internal draft in 2014 that would have set a more defined policy for transgender student equal access, but it was never made public. Despite a board member’s 2015 request for clarity, the district has yet to approve any policy changes for transgender student access, instead making decisions on a case-by-case basis. District spokeswoman Michelle Booth said efforts to adopt a policy are ongoing. "The Clark County School District has received the ‘Letter to Colleagues’ from the U.S. Department of Education and is currently studying the details closely to determine what if any changes we will have to make to remain in compliance with federal guidelines," she said in an emailed statement. McGinley said the uncertainty on federal and state levels means there’s no clear evidence of a mandate on allowing transgender students the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. "Each county and school district are making these determinations based on how much risk they’re willing to take," she said. Our ruling Several Republican Assembly candidates are claiming that legislators are forcing "boys to shower with girls." Putting aside questions about the nature of gender, these ads just aren’t accurate. They refer to a piece of legislation that mostly deals with creating new anti-bullying policies. There is no clearly defined mandate in Nevada state law regarding transgender student access to bathrooms and locker rooms, and school districts around the state have very different standards county-to-county. Given the likelihood of future litigation on both a federal and state level, it’s misleading to connect a vaguely worded anti-bullying bill to the much more complicated area of transgender student rights. We rate these ads False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b783899-a799-4b5e-be8a-eae37ab688f1	None	Nevada Assembly Republican Candidates	None	None	None	2016-06-13T18:00:00	2016-05-31	['None']

pomt-13947	Even among "second and third generation" Muslims in the United States, "there's no real assimilation."	false	/nbc/statements/2016/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-theres-no-real-assimilation-us-/	After the mass shooting in Orlando by a man who pledged allegiance to the Islamic terrorist group ISIS, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his call for a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the United States. During an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Trump elaborated on one of the problems he sees with the Muslim community in America. Hannity said that Muslims have different religious and cultural practices than many Americans. He asked Trump, "If you grow up (as a Muslim overseas) and you want to come to America, how do we vet somebody's heart and ascertain if they're coming here for freedom or if they want to proselytize, indoctrinate and bring their theocracy with them?" Trump responded, "Assimilation has been very hard. It's almost — I won't say nonexistent, but it gets to be pretty close. And I'm talking about second and third generation. They come — they don't — for some reason, there's no real assimilation." We were intrigued by the question of whether "there's no real assimilation" among "second and third generation" Muslims in the United States. So we looked at the social-science data and sought expert opinion. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) We concluded that the implication of what Trump said — that Muslims want to isolate themselves from the mainstream American culture — is flat wrong. However, we also learned that the question involves some important nuance. In particular, the task of "assimilation" facing post-1960s immigrants to America is more complicated than, and thus distinct from, what it was for white, Christian, European immigrants who came to the United States in prior generations. By and large, Muslims want to embrace an American identity Several academic studies in the past decade have demonstrated that Muslims do indeed want to become integrated with mainstream American life. One of the major surveys is from 2011, when the Pew Research Center conducted telephone interviews with 1,033 Muslims in the United States, in English, Arabic, Farsi and Urdu. The researchers concluded that "Muslim Americans appear to be highly assimilated into American society." Specifically, 56 percent of Muslim Americans said that most Muslims coming to the United States today want to adopt American customs and ways of life. Only 20 percent said most Muslims coming to the U.S. want to be distinct from the larger American society, Pew found, while 16 percent said Muslim immigrants want to do both. (Incidentally, this is far different than the views of Americans at large; just 33 percent of Americans of all backgrounds told Pew that most Muslim immigrants want to adopt American ways, while 51 percent said Muslim immigrants want to remain distinct from the larger culture.) Notably, Pew found some striking similarities between the views of American Christians and American Muslims. For instance, about half of Muslims said they thought of themselves first as a Muslim, rather than as American. A different Pew survey found a nearly identical fraction of Christians in the United States, 46 percent, saying they thought of themselves first as Christian, rather than as American. And near-identical percentages of Muslims and Christians said there was no conflict with being devout in their own religion and part of a modern society. (Sentiments about identity were similar among native-born and foreign-born Muslims, though those born after 1990 had a somewhat larger preference for a Muslim identity.) Jen’nan Ghazal Read, an associate professor of sociology and global health at Duke University, pointed to data from Pew and other sources showing similar rates of religious practice and beliefs among Muslims and Christians in the United States: Other evidence lines up with what Pew found. Selcuk R. Sirin, an associate professor of applied psychology at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, found that even though 84 percent of 12-to-18-year-old Muslim Americans he studied had faced at least one act of discrimination in the previous year, most were comfortable with their "hyphenated identities" as both Muslims and Americans. "They seem to be pretty happy sitting on the hyphen," has said. "They don't feel the need to pick one over the other." Akbar S. Ahmed, a professor of Islamic studies at American University, found similar sentiments when he did fieldwork for the book Journey into America, which spanned 75 cities and 100 mosques. "Muslims again and again told us that America is the best place in the world to be a Muslim," Ahmed said. "There are countless examples of Muslims who are assimilated and are completely American in every sense." He said that out of the roughly 2,000 personal interviews that comprised in his fieldwork, virtually all Muslims said that Muslims could be American. "So it is dangerous, irresponsible and incorrect for Trump to make statements like this and demonize the entire community," Ahmed said. Some experts have said that, if anything, that the trend is moving even more strongly towards becoming American. "In the 1970s and 1980s, Muslim leaders explicitly urged their people to avoid assimilating into the American mainstream and to withdraw into Islamic community centers, schools, and colleges," Boston College political science Peter Skerry wrote in 2013. "Since 9/11, Muslim leaders have shown a remarkable​ — ​and largely unnoted, or disbelieved ​— ​willingness to adapt to America. Indeed, these leaders have been busily reconstructing an anodyne version of Islam that conforms to the American civil religion." In other words, Skerry wrote, Muslim Americans today "are being reassured that it is permissible​—​even desirable​—​to have non-Muslim friends. And that it is okay to attend business lunches where non-Muslim colleagues drink alcohol. And that it is definitely a good idea to vote and get involved in civic and political affairs." Integration is a bigger challenge for Muslims So there’s clear evidence that, contrary to what Trump suggests, Muslims are embracing American identity and values. At the same time, Muslim Americans by and large do not want to eradicate all traces of their religious and cultural heritage. This is similar to patterns seen in many immigrant groups that came to the United States beginning in the 1960s, when the nation’s immigration system was oriented away from its previous focus on European immigrants and toward other parts of the world. Prior to the 1960s, most immigrants to the United States were white and Christian. They may have had national identities and cultural practices from their native country, but in most cases, they shared a religion and a race with the majority American culture. That meant it was easier for them to "assimilate," as Trump said, in the larger culture. But more recent waves of immigrants from Asia, India and the Middle East often have not shared the same race or religion as the American majority. So "assimilation" in the traditional sense has been a more complicated process. Assimilating to the mainstream American culture to the same degree as someone like Trump’s ancestors did (his grandfather emigrated from Germany) would require a Muslim to renounce their religion and become Christian. (And, obviously, they could not change their skin color or other physical features.) This has led scholars to shift away from the term "assimilation" and toward the term "integration." Sarah Lyons-Padilla, a research scientist at Stanford University, and Michele Gelfand, a professor at the University of Maryland, describe "assimilation" as part of an older "melting pot" model, while "integration" is more like a "mosaic." "We should not confuse integration with assimilation," Lyons-Padilla and Gelfand have written. "Integration means encouraging immigrants to call themselves American, German or French and to take pride in their own cultural and religious heritage." Research by Lyons-Padilla and Gelfand found that Muslim-Americans’ support for "assimilation" — essentially, the melting-pot model — is low, statistically, at 1.76 on a 6-point scale. But they found support for the integration model to be quite high, at 4.96 out of 6. "This tells you that Muslim Americans don't want to assimilate into American culture at the expense of giving up their own cultural identity, but they are very interested in embracing both," Lyons-Padilla told PolitiFact. She added that psychologists generally see the integration model as a more practical one to aspire to. "Decades' worth of research shows that people fare best when they can have a foot in both worlds," Lyons-Padilla said. Our ruling Trump said that even among "second and third generation" Muslims in the United States, "there's no real assimilation." The data and the experts agree that Trump is wrong. Substantial evidence confirms that Muslim Americans want to have an American identity and think that doing so is achievable. In fact, their preferences for self-identification mirror those of Christian Americans. The data show that American Muslims want to be both American and Muslim. That’s different than the widely recognized "melting pot" model where immigrants of generations past blended in fully in their new country based on a shared religion and culture. But the reality is that for most Muslim Americans, religion and race would have made it impossible for them to follow that course in the first place. We rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ccf1be4b-8a88-4196-947c-b78eff07ae33	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-18T05:00:00	2016-06-15	['United_States']
pomt-04046	Since taking office in January 2011, "the ‘rainy day’ fund has increased by 226 percent."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/29/nathan-deal/deal-rainy-day-fund-blossoming/	The state of Georgia, as does most governments, keeps a reserve or "rainy day fund" in case it needs extra money. During his State of the State address, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal's Twitter page offered some specifics. "The 'rainy day' fund has increased by 226 percent" since he took office, Deal's staff tweeted. Amid budget cuts and a sluggish economy, we wanted to know if the governor and his staff were correct. Georgia had to borrow from its revenue shortfall reserve fund in 2009, after the Great Recession began. Georgia’s fund went from nearly $1.5 billion in 2007 to about $104 million two years later, according to state budget records. Most states also had significant declines in their reserves, according to the Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. During the 12-month fiscal year when Deal took office, Georgia’s reserve fund was $116,021,961. During fiscal year 2012, which ended June 30, 2012, the reserve fund was $377,971,440, records show. The increase, as the governor said, was approximately 226 percent. Carolyn Bourdeaux, the former director of the Georgia Senate Budget and Evaluation Office, reviewed the numbers against the most recent annual state audit report and saw an even higher figure for the reserve, which was about $520 million. The current state budget is about $19.3 billion. Bourdeaux, who teaches in the public management and policy department at Georgia State University, noted that Deal has made cuts in various areas and the state has seen modest economic growth in the past two years. Deal asked most state agencies last year to cut their budgets by at least 3 percent due to concerns about the economy. The governor said he wants to find $553 million in reductions through June 2014. Some budget experts, such as the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute’s executive director, Alan Essig, say the budget cuts and midyear revenue adjustments have helped Deal increase the rainy day fund. Essig, though, believes the rainy day fund is still "dangerously low" and that the state needs to raise taxes. He believes the fund should be near 10 percent of the state budget, which would be close to $2 billion. Most states currently have about 2 percent of their entire budget set aside for a rainy day fund, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Georgia has about 2 percent of its budget set aside in reserves. We found nothing that contradicts the governor’s claim. Our rating: True.

pomt-03096	Some "20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions" as a result of "political favoritism and backroom deals."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/sep/24/michael-turner/mike-turner-says-delphi-retirees-lost-pensions-pol/	In April 2012, PolitiFact Ohio issued a "Mostly False" rating to a claim by a congressman from Dayton, Michael Turner, over the loss of pension benefits of salaried retirees from Delphi, the auto parts maker. Turner had said that some "20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions" as a result of "political favoritism and backroom deals." A rating of Mostly False means that the statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. In this case, the loss of pensions was not in question. The pensions were cut after Delphi, which once was part of General Motors, hit deep financial problems. But the rest of the claim, ascribing blame to political favoritism and Obama administration backroom deals, was not supported by facts. We based the ruling on the available evidence, which included Government Accountability Office reports and congressional testimony. We also noted that eventually, a fuller accounting of the Delphi matter would come out from a special inspector general. When it did, we said, we’d consider taking another look. That report is out. And based on it, we are upgrading the rating a notch to Half True. Some background: In 2009, GM was in financial trouble and the federal government bailed it out with a financial package worth more than $50 billion, including a loan and an equity stake in a post-bankruptcy, restructured company. There were others in the auto industry also in trouble, including Delphi. And GM and Delphi were the corporate equivalent of step brothers, if not blood relatives. Delphi was a division of GM until the parts maker was spun off as an independent company in 1999. Before the spinoff, Delphi maintained separate pension funds for its unionized and non-unionized workforces. The non-unionized workers were salaried, many in white-collar or support jobs, and their pension fund was flush. The union pension fund, however, was not. In other cases, this might have meant that the unionized workers would eventually get smaller pensions than planned. But in this case, GM made a deal that kept the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, or UAW, happy, which helped facilitate the Delphi spinoff. The deal was this: GM would make up, or "top-up," the difference between the underfunded pension payments and the amounts the workers would have gotten if their pension fund were in fine health. This was not just benevolence. By agreeing to the top-up, GM was able to hand off Delphi operations without union opposition and keep its outside supply chain running. And so the parties codified the top-up provision and kept it in force. But a decade later, the twin bankruptcies of GM and Delphi created a wrinkle. GM had the right in bankruptcy to void its contracts. That could have meant the end to the top-up agreement. It so happened that by now, the fortunes of Delphi’s nonunion workforce and retirees had turned. The once-full pension fund for non-union, or salaried, retirees was underfunded as well. But unlike their unionized colleagues, the salaried or non-unionized retirees had no top-up deal. So what would happen? Two things: First, the Obama administration would agree to bail out General Motors and give it money to keep operating. But before the final sign-off, the administration through its Treasury Department-appointed auto task force would need to review GM’s obligations and make decisions about what and whether it owed Delphi retirees. Bankruptcies typically involve many parties being told to accept the fact that they are never going to get every penny they are owed. Yet that’s not what happened in the case of the Delphi unionized-worker pensions. GM, with considerable help from the Treasury auto team, agreed that even as it exited bankruptcy as a new organization, it would continue to top-up the UAW pensions from its parts supplier. It also agreed to continue top-ups for the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, and the United Steelworkers of America. But GM and Treasury’s auto team left the salaried retiree pensions alone. The non-union retirees would get no top-up. As a result, those retirees would only collect 30 percent to 70 percent of their expected pensions, which would be paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., or PBGC, the federal agency that takes over failing pension plans. Was this fair? Turner and other lawmakers from auto states said no, as did Delphi retirees. They said that despite the pre-existing top-up agreements, GM’s bankruptcy gave the automaker the right to rewrite the top-up contracts, just as it rewrote a number of unrelated terms with the union’s consent. Even better, they said, GM and Treasury could have worked out a way to make all Delphi retirees whole. But that didn’t happen. There were winners (the union) and losers (the non-union retirees), and that looked like political favoritism and backroom dealing to Turner and other critics. But in 2012, congressional testimony and GAO reports led PolitiFact Ohio to conclude that Treasury and GM made the decision because: (a) the union had long-standing top-up agreements and salaried retirees did not, and (b) any attempt to end those agreements would have caused the UAW to balk or even strike. Treasury maintained that it was vital to get GM stabilized quickly, and an interruption to its ability to get parts for its cars -- due to labor unrest -- could be fatal. There was nothing to back up Turner’s claim that the top-up decision was made because of political favoritism and backroom dealing. The GAO said that "court filings and statements from GM and Treasury officials support that Treasury deferred to GM’s business judgment." Based on this, PolitiFact Ohio gave Turner’s claim a "Mostly False" rating." That’s where matters stood until Aug. 15, when additional information was released though the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, provided federal funds for bank bailouts as well as the auto rescue, and was overseen by Treasury. The report by the special inspector general, an independent watchdog, provided a long-awaited assessment of Treasury’s role in the pension controversy. The SIGTARP report confirmed much of what the GAO already said. It reported that GM and Treasury were concerned about getting the automaker back on its feet quickly -- and that, in the words of Steven Rattner, head of the auto team, trying to get more on pensions "was a game of chicken we didn’t want to play. We were under incredible time pressure." Why, then, upgrade PolitiFact Ohio’s rating? The SIGTARP report contained new information about the dominant role that Treasury’s auto team played. The team’s role in the decision to top-up the pensions of UAW workers was not just advisory, the SIGTARP report said. Treasury’s financial role gave it a dominant position. GM could not make decisions without Treasury. GM’s chief financial officer at the time, Ray Young, told SIGTARP that Treasury’s influence, a result of its financial stake, was such that GM "put forward recommendations, but at the end of the day (Treasury) makes the final decision." This was all done privately. Those with leverage, particularly Treasury and the UAW, were able to make their demands. Delphi’s salaried retirees, who believed the government could make them whole, had no leverage and were largely kept on the outside. That is a clear impression from the SIGTARP report. This is the way most negotiations occur, including many involving individual Congress members, as a Treasury spokesman noted as we discussed this with him. But Turner’s claim did not involve other deals. He was speaking specifically of the Delphi pension matter. So we return to Turner’s claim about "political favoritism and backroom deals." A rating of Half True means the statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Turner’s claim is partially accurate. Treasury’s heavy role, well-reasoned or not, was largely played out in closed meetings. It was not subject to transparency -- a key reason why the White House and members of the House of Representatives government oversight committee, on which Turner serves, continue to spar over the committee’s demands for more information and testimony. Was there political favoritism? We can’t know for sure because of the lack of transparency, nor can Turner, but there isn’t evidence to prove it. And the claim still requires a considerable amount of context to understand fully. But until the SIGTARP report’s release, the extent of Treasury’s role -- the backroom considerations -- were more a matter of speculation than fact. We believe this warrants an upgrade. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.	None	Michael Turner	None	None	None	2013-09-24T16:30:00	2012-04-22	['None']
pomt-05815	Mitt Romney "supervised a company guilty of massive Medicare fraud."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/21/winning-our-future/was-super-pac-right-romney-claim/	Georgia voters, brace yourselves for some rounds of political ad warfare. With two weeks before the Republican presidential primary in Georgia, part of Super Tuesday, surrogates for former Georgia congressman and House Speaker Newt Gingrich are battling supporters of GOP rival Mitt Romney via the 30-second ad. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported last week that Gingrich supporters are paying for radio time to direct listeners to a website, Time to Choose, that lays out the facts about their candidate and the truth about Romney. There, we found several ads produced by a pro-Gingrich super political action committee, Winning Our Future. The ads attack Romney and make claims such as this: "Romney supervised a company guilty of massive Medicare fraud. That’s a fact!" Really? Not so, said Flackcheck.org, a website run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Flackcheck.orgcq played that portion of the ad and flashed the word "MISLEADING" over the video. So who’s correct here, and what is this all about? In 1989, while Romney was head of the investment firm Bain Capital, it bought a medical testing company in Massachusetts called Damon Corp. Bain’s business was buying companies, making them financially sound, and then selling them for a profit. Bain took the company public in 1991 and Romney served on its board of directors. Damon Corp. was sold in 1993 to Corning Inc., according to news reports and "The Real Romney," a biography written by Boston Globe reporters. PolitiFact Florida, investigating a similar claim about Romney, reported: In October 1996, federal prosecutors announced that Damon was agreeing to pay $119 million in both civil and criminal fines after pleading guilty to defrauding Medicare. The company was providing doctors with forms that didn’t make clear what tests included, so doctors were checking off additional tests that weren’t necessary, according to the Globe’s summary of the government’s case. The overbilling went from 1988 through 1993, prosecutors said. "This is a case, pure and simple, of corporate greed run amok," U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said when the settlement was announced. Romney claimed to have uncovered the fraud, but the Globe reported that prosecutors gave the bulk of the credit to exposing the problem to Corning. The Globe first reported on Damon Corp. more than a decade ago. The case was recycled last month before the Florida primary when Gingrich and Romney duked it out for the Sunshine State’s prized delegate count. PolitiFact Florida rated the claim Mostly True that when Romney "was a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions." PolitiFact Florida found it was difficult to assess whether Romney knew about the fraud and what he did to stop it since the implication was that Romney should had known what was going on. Winning Our Future’s claim is more specific. That ad says Romney "supervised," and was not just a "director" of the company. Winning Our Future spokesman Rick Tyler directed us to a recent Forbes article about the issue. Forbes reported much of what was in the Boston Globe, including Romney’s defense and what prosecutors said Corning did to uncover the fraud. Forbes wrote "it would be reasonable to conclude that while the illegal activity was going on under Mr. Romney’s nose, Romney would, himself, bear only some responsibility for perhaps not being as on top of things as one might hope for a company’s director to be." "Every board member has a fiduciary responsibility for the company they serve but Romney’s role was very hands-on at Damon," Tyler told us via email. "He led Bain to acquire the company and he put himself on the board and was a very active member in the company. "Despite this, the fact remains that Damon was engaged in Medicare and other fraud when Bain purchased the company, was engaged in fraud while Bain owned the company and continued to engage in fraud when Bain sold the company, which was sold the same month the subpoenas were issued." The overbilling began before Bain bought Damon and continued for several years. For two years, Damon was under Bain’s ownership before it went public. Afterward, Romney served on its board. Winning Our Future’s claim that Romney "supervised" the Damon Corp. is more specific than the prior claim. It suggests that Romney had a direct role in supervising the company. As PolitiFact Florida found, it is difficult to determine whether Romney was involved in the fraud. Bain had control of Damon for four years, two of those before it went public. We believe Romney had some authority over the policies at Damon. But to say he "supervised" the company is somewhat of a stretch. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07414	"CNN did a poll recently where Obama and I are statistically tied."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/27/donald-trump/trump-says-recent-cnn-poll-shows-him-competitive-c/	At an April 27, 2011, news conference in Portsmouth, N.H., businessman and possible Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump boasted about how good a candidate he would be against President Barack Obama. In a news conference that followed the White House’s release of Obama’s original birth certificate -- after Trump for weeks had publicly raised questions about whether Obama was actually born in Hawaii -- Trump said, "I think, if I do run, I'll do very well. And I think -- look, I'm already leading the polls, and I'm not running. ... CNN did a poll recently where Obama and I are statistically tied. If you would like, I can send it to you. Just call up CNN." There was no need to call up CNN. The network quickly posted a story headlined, "Trump cites CNN poll, but CNN didn't conduct such a poll." The authors of the CNN article said that Trump may have been referring to a Newsweek/Daily Beast poll from February -- more than two months ago. According to CNN, the national survey by Newsweek/Daily Beast "indicated that in a hypothetical general election matchup between President Barack Obama and Trump as the GOP nominee, Obama beat Trump by only two percentage points, 43 to 41, which was well with in the survey's sampling error." More recent polls tell a different story, however, suggesting that the results from Newsweek/Daily Beast head-to-head matchup between Obama and Trump are either outdated, an outlier or both. The website RealClearPolitics, which tracks most political polling, offers six such head-to-head matchups, with an average margin of more than 13 points in Obama’s favor. Here’s the rundown: • ABC News/Washington Post (April 14-17): Obama 52, Trump 40 • McClatchy/Marist (April 10-14): Obama 54, Trump 38 • Rasmussen Reports (April 15-16): Obama 49, Trump 34 • FOX News (April 3-5): Obama 52, Trump 34 • Newsweek/Daily Beast (Feb. 12-15) Obama 43, Trump 41 • Public Policy Polling (Feb. 11-14), Obama 48, Trump 34 A couple of notes: Rasmussen and Public Policy Polling use automated-dialing methods, which many polling experts consider less reliable than polls conducted by human operators. In addition, Rasmussen is widely considered Republican-leaning while PPP is a Democratic firm. The other four firms that asked the question are independent polls sponsored by media organizations and which use traditional polling methodology. In addition, the two earliest polls -- including the Newsweek/Daily Beast poll -- were conducted before Trump became closely identified with the birth certificate issue. On Feb. 10, 2011, Trump for the first time used a high-profile venue to publicly question Obama’s background, when he told attendees of the conservative CPAC conference that "the people that went to school with (Obama), they never saw him, they don't know who he is." (Four days later, PolitiFact gave the statement a Pants on Fire rating.) After Trump began broadcasting his views on Obama’s birth certificate in a series of nationally televised interviews, his head-to-head numbers against Obama worsened. His average for the four polls conducted in April produced an average Obama lead of more than 15 points. So, Trump not only gave an incorrect attribution for the poll that showed him within the margin of error, but he also ignored or didn't know about more recent polls that suggest he would not do well in a head-to-head contest against Obama. We also think it’s misleading of Trump to characterize the poll as "recent." In another context, he might have an argument that it’s "recent," but in a dynamic, fast-changing primary contest, two months is the equivalent of a geological eon. The fact is, the most recent four polls show Trump losing to Obama by near-landslide proportions. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-04884	Says Connie Mack IV has been "a promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/07/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-mack-iv-has-been-promoter-/	The primary isn’t over yet, but Bill Nelson expects his general election rival for U.S. Senate will be Connie Mack IV, and he’s launched his first statewide ad attacking his rival. Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, released the ad against Mack, a Republican congressman from Fort Myers, on Aug. 2. It seeks to paint Mack as a brawling incompetent. Narrator: "Florida, meet Connie Mack IV. A promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage. A big spender with a trail of debts, liens and unpaid bills. He has one of the worst attendance records in Congress this year but he still voted to end Medicare as we know it. Questionable work habits. A sense of entitlement. Connie Mack, he thinks the rules are different for him." That echoes some online attacks by Mack’s Republican primary opponent George LeMieux, who dropped out of the race in June because of Mack’s overwhelming lead in the polls and fundraising. LeMieux claimed that Mack’s only "real job in the real world" was an events coordinator for Hooters. We ruled that Mostly False because Mack had some additional private sector jobs including selling fitness equipment. PolitiFact Florida also recently checked a claim by another Mack Republican rival, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, that Mack missed "almost half" his votes in Congress this year. We rated that Mostly False. Though Mack had missed votes, he had not missed that many. In this report, we will briefly review Mack’s Hooters-related job and whether he had a "history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage." Mack’s work for Hooters Mack campaign spokesman David James told us for our previous fact check about Hooters that Mack was a marketing executive for LTP Management from 1994 to 2000. The company owned and operated several Hooters franchises in Florida, as well as Dan Marino's Town Tavern and Lulu's Bait Shack. Mack never received a paycheck directly from Hooters, but "we never denied he worked on behalf of Hooters," James said. Hooters has often been mentioned in articles throughout Mack’s political career, which started with a state House seat he won in 2000. He won his first congressional race in 2004. A 2000 Palm Beach Post article quipped: "When he announced his candidacy in November, he mentioned his ‘broad business experience’ - surely an unintentional pun." The Tampa Bay Times The Buzz blog recently posted Mack’s Hooters business card. Nelson’s ad cited a 2012 POLITICO blog headline: "Connie Mack’s Hooters connection." The blog stated that Mack, his political action committee and his wife U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack, R-Calif., received nearly $50,000 in donations from Hooters management during their time in office. Our one criticism about this part of the ad is that Nelson didn’t make it clear that Mack’s Hooters-related work ended more than a decade ago. Calling Mack "a promoter for Hooters" leaves the impression that Mack currently works for Hooters. That isn’t accurate -- he stopped working for LTP management in 2000. "A history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage" Now let’s turn to the portion of the ad where the narrator said that Mack had "a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage." On the screen the word "arrest" also appears. The ad cites a March 2012 Associated Press article describing past incidents that occurred in the 1980s and early 1990s when Mack was in his 20s. The Miami Herald also wrote about Mack’s past in February 2012. We will pull from both newspaper articles plus court documents the Miami Herald posted online to summarize these incidents. 1989 nightclub arrest: While at a Jacksonville nightclub called Bananas, Mack, then 22, was arrested by an off-duty Duval County sheriff’s deputy. After Mack or one of his friends was asked to remove his hat (reports conflict on this point), Mack refused and swore at club workers, according to employee testimony. Mack refused to leave and was arrested for resisting an officer without violence. Mack called the arrest a misunderstanding and pleaded no contest. The judge withheld adjudication, meaning he has no criminal record, according to the Herald. The report was sealed by court order. As we'll see, Mack was later involved in litigation that brought the incident to light. 1992 bar brawl: In February 1992, Mack got into a brawl with then-professional baseball player Ron Gant at an Atlanta bar called Calico Jack’s. The Miami Herald reported: "A waitress testified that Mack, who had been heavily drinking beer and Jagermeister shots all night, took the first swing at Gant. Mack testified he couldn’t remember how much beer he drank, but said he had only one liquor shot — of tequila. Gant claims a drunken Mack repeatedly bumped into him, precipitating a fight. Mack claims Gant attacked him for no reason. During the melee, Gant head-locked Mack. Mack testified that he couldn’t breath. So he starting striking and grabbing the ball player’s crotch. At a certain point, the club’s bouncers got involved and Mack broke his ankle. He sued Gant, who was held liable. But a jury awarded no damages." (Here is a court document in which Mack describes that incident at length.) Late 1980s road rage incidents: The road rage incidents came to light in a 1996 deposition involving the Gant case. Here is how Mack described them: In one incident, which Mack placed around 1987 or 1988, Mack and a girlfriend were driving to Cape Coral when he said a man tried to run them off the road after he thought that Mack’s girlfriend had cut in front of him. She drove off the road into a ditch, and Mack and the other man got out. "He attempted a swing at me, and I swung back and hit him..." Mack testified. Mack said he then headed back to his car and the other man, wielding a bat, chased him, tried to hit him and then smashed the windows of Mack’s car. In the other incident, which Mack placed around 1987, occurred in West Palm Beach when he was in a car with friends and stopped at a draw bridge. The guys in Mack’s car had just watched a Howie Mandel video, and one of the guys in the car was "in the back screaming like Howie Mandel." A man in another car apparently got upset. Mack got out of his car, and the other man got out of his car and jumped on top of Mack. Mack said he later received a phone call from a police sergeant who said someone wanted to press charges but that he never heard anything about it again. We don’t have a full account of the road rage incidents -- the Associated Press wrote that court records in the Gant civil suit didn’t include testimony from the other people involved. And there were conflicting accounts in the Jacksonville and Atlanta brawls. For example, in the Gant fight a waitress said Mack bought about 20 pitchers of beer and rounds of shots over five hours and was drunk, while Mack said he felt no effect from two to four beers and one shot over two hours, according to the Associated Press. Mack’s response For this article we asked James, Mack’s campaign spokesman, if he had anything he wanted us to review. James told us in an email that "all of this is very important as PolitiFact found all of this stuff false or mostly false in the spring when LeMieux did it." A Mack spokesman previously told the Miami Herald as for Mack’s past brawls that Mack was "young and foolish" at that time. Our ruling Nelson told TV viewers across the state: "Florida, meet Connie Mack IV. A promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage." The word "arrest" appeared during the ad. Much of that statement is true, but there are some key omissions: • Nelson failed to make it clear that Mack stopped working as a promoter for Hooters 12 years ago. • Nelson omitted the timeline on the criminal history and road rage: Those incidents occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mack was in 20s at the time. He’s now about to turn 45. • We have an incomplete picture of the road rage incidents, making it difficult to discern how much Mack was to blame.

pomt-11154	Gov. Wolf is trying to implement "a severance tax that would be financed by Pennsylvania’s working class"	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/may/25/scott-wagner/pennsylvanians-would-only-pay-fraction-gov-tom-wol/	Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner says Pennsylvanians will bear the financial burden of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan for a severance tax on natural gas production in the Commonwealth. In a May 21 email sent to supporters, the York County-based state senator wrote that Wolf’s plan to impose a tax on natural gas extracted, or "severed," in Pennsylvania "would be financed by Pennsylvania’s working class." But would the severance tax — expected to raise $108 million in the first year — actually be financed by Pennsylvanians? A severance tax is paid by drillers who pass the production expense on to retailers of the commodity, in this case utility companies, who would then likely offset the added expense by charging higher rates to end-of-the-line consumers. The tax has a variable rate based on the price of natural gas and the volume produced by a given well. Terry Engender, a professor with Penn State’s Department of Geosciences, added, "The reality is that any cost put on the industry will be passed on to consumers. That’s a fact of life." In this case, it’s a question of where those consumers are located. And that’s not unusual. According to The Fiscal Times, "Virtually all energy states benefit from passing their cost of government to consumers outside their borders. Texas avoids an income tax in large part by charging a 7.5 percent severance tax on natural gas and a 4.6 percent severance tax on crude oil. North Dakota now gets 40 percent of state revenues from severance taxes." Beth Melena, Wolf campaign spokeswoman, said in an email, "Pennsylvanians are currently paying to improve roads and schools in Oklahoma and Texas while getting nothing in return." At a press conference earlier this year, Wolf argued that in-state consumers wouldn’t see their utility bills spike because of a severance tax. He pointed to an Independent Fiscal Office (IFO) report in making the claim that 80 percent of natural gas produced in Pennsylvania is used by customers in other states and that, as a result, "80 percent of the revenue raised by a reasonable severance tax would be paid by customers outside of Pennsylvania." We reached out to the IFO to see if this interpretation is accurate. Mark Ryan, deputy director for the nonpartisan state agency, said, generally speaking, it is. "I don’t think we’ve explicitly said that, but that could be considered a fair interpretation," Ryan said. Ryan said that based on federal data, the IFO estimates Pennsylvania natural gas consumption is about 20 percent of total production in the Commonwealth. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said because of Marcellus Shale production here, Pennsylvania can meet its own demand. Pennsylvania is one of the largest natural gas-producing states in the country. "The remaining 80 percent — one could assert it’s being exported, and that’s just a rough measure," he added. Those percentages, however, can and do change, shifting the amount of gas remaining in the commonwealth and that which is exported. Meanwhile, Wagner’s camp is doubling down on its claim. "It’s clear Gov. Wolf doesn’t understand simple economics," said Wagner spokesman Andrew Romeo in an email. "If Pennsylvania’s gas industry is taxed further, that tax will be passed on to consumers in Pennsylvania. The governor can try to spin it all he wants, but the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry and the Marcellus Shale Coalition both have disagreed with his assessment of what would happen to utility bills in Pennsylvania." Our ruling Wagner said Wolf’s severance tax "would be financed by Pennsylvania’s working class." And with Pennsylvanians consuming roughly 20 percent of the gas produced here, the severance tax likely will cause utility bills in Pennsylvania to grow. But according to the IFO, more of the expense would be absorbed by consumers in other states where Pennsylvania natural gas is shipped. Additionally, there are many factors that would impact the ratio — everything from market forces to commodity prices to the tax amount levied to the availability of pipeline infrastructure across Pennsylvania to move gas to other markets. Without that nuance, Wagner’s claim leads a reasonable reader to conclude that the entirety of the burden would be borne by residents of the Commonwealth. Given that, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02343	For educational testing, Florida "has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/24/florida-stop-common-core-coalition/florida-stop-common-core-coalition-says-education-/	In choosing the American Institutes for Research to create new accountability tests for Florida, education commissioner Pam Stewart stressed the group’s ability to create tests specifically tailored for Florida. "The new assessment will measure each child’s progress and achievement on the Florida Standards, which were developed with an unprecedented amount of public input," Stewart said in a press release. Common Core foes, who contend the "Florida standards" differ little from the widely adopted national Common Core academic standards, were again disappointed. With their efforts to derail the initiative itself foundering, one group took aim at the testing company instead. They noted the American Institutes for Research, called AIR, was tied to the Common Core with its work creating tests for the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. Then they accused the organization of promoting a homosexual lifestyle for children. "This is completely unacceptable. Besides implementing the same deceptive plan discussed at the governor's summit in August, the state has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old," Florida Eagle Forum lobbyist Randy Osborne said in a Florida Stop Common Core Coalition letter to supporters. The group takes a page from Utahns Against Common Core, which also blasted AIR for its work on LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) issues after that state adopted AIR tests in 2012. There is some basis for the statements. AIR has an active practice area creating materials for schools on LGBT Youth issues, in which it studies the youngsters’ experiences and offers recommendations for how to help them survive a world that can be harsh and judgmental. It describes its practice in this way: "AIR’s Human and Social Development program develops knowledge and understanding about LGBT youth that takes account of their experiences and needs. AIR also enhances opportunities for the healthy development, well-being, and safety of LGBT children, youth, and their families by providing workforce training and technical assistance to service providers across systems addressing behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and homelessness." AIR only provides materials on gay and lesbian issues to schools and organizations that request it. It also does similar work in the areas of bullying and substance abuse in addition to its efforts in education, health and workforce matters. And the group does not promote the issues, spokesman Larry McQuillan said. "We are not an advocacy group," McQuillan said. "AIR is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization. We do educational assessment, research, health policy research and communication, and international development. We have supported many states by providing high-quality assessments of their specific state standards." That is generally how the organization is viewed. "AIR is known for being an independent and important provider of high-quality educational research, resources, and training for federal, state, and local stakeholders," said Anne Hyslop of the New America Foundation. "Their work is widely respected, and they have a long history of producing valuable contributions to the field." She suggested that the attack had more to do with the Common Core than with AIR itself. AIR received no criticism when selected to develop Florida’s hotly controversial "value-added" model of teacher evaluations. When it came to standards-related testing, though, the Stop Common Core coalition suggested that AIR’s work on LGBT issues would come through. "We know that our children's tests will likely include these types of issues and that the test and other data will go to the state, the federal government, and to corporations," said co-founder Karen Effrem, urging tea party conservatives to pressure Gov. Rick Scott to stop the process. (PolitiFact Florida has fact-checked claims that personal data will go to the federal government and found such claims exaggerated.) Effrem and Osborne did not respond to interview requests. The issue could resonate with groups who find that even simple acknowledgement of LGBT people is activism to be demonized, said Daryl Presgraves of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. Florida Department of Education spokesman Joe Follick, however, did not bite at the rhetoric, which he deemed essentially irrelevant. "AIR was chosen for their ability to provide an assessment that aligns with Florida’s standards. Not anything else," Follick said. Republican legislative leaders also backed the commissioner. Senate President Don Gaetz "supports Commissioner Stewart and is confident that AIR will develop a Florida-specific assessment that will test students based on Florida-specific standards," spokeswoman Katie Betta said. Our ruling The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition said that the American Institutes for Research promotes the identification of homosexual lifestyles in young children. It is true that AIR does research on LGBT youth issues and offers advice to organizations that request it on how to assist these children. This is one piece of the group’s initiatives, which also include work on disease management and student assessments. AIR does not advocate a homosexual lifestyle for children, nor is it an advocacy group at all. There is no indication that the organization or the state will have a homosexual agenda in its state testing. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01691	"Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/14/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-tops-its-neighbors-inc/	Wisconsin lagged all of the Midwest in job growth in the latest quarterly employment numbers, released in June 2014. So is it possible that by another economic measure -- the state’s total personal income -- the Badger State is gaining faster than all of its neighbors? Gov. Scott Walker made that claim July 30, 2014 on his campaign Twitter account: Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year. (US BEA Q1 2013 over Q1 2014) — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 30, 2014 In the tweet, Walker cited U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates comparing the first quarter income total for 2014 to those from the same quarter one year earlier. The agency, an arm of the U.S. Commerce Department, publishes quarterly estimates of the total personal income in each state. There’s no "Midwest" category in the agency’s geographical breakdowns. Two of the regions it defines include states often associated as Midwestern peers for the Badger State. One is the "Great Lakes" region (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). The other is the "Plains" region: (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota). When we looked at percentage income growth for both regions, Walker’s claim held up. Among those 12 states, Wisconsin’s 3.33 percent income growth led the way, topping Ohio (3.12 percent) and Illinois (3.08 percent.) Minnesota and Iowa were toward the low end at 1.6 percent and 1.13 percent, respectively. Nationally, Wisconsin’s increase fell below the overall U.S. growth (3.55 percent) and trailed growth in 20 states. The top five states -- Oregon, Colorado, Texas, California and Washington -- ranged from 4.5 percent to 5.35 percent. Wisconsin’s top showing was an improvement over three previous one-year comparisons using fourth, third and second-quarter figures: -- Fourth Quarter of 2013 vs. fourth quarter of 2012: Wisconsin trailed income growth in North Dakota and Iowa. -- Third quarter: Wisconsin was in fifth place. -- Second quarter: Wisconsin trailed two states, North Dakota and Michigan. In March 2014, the Journal Sentinel reported that from 2012 to 2013, Wisconsin's growth in personal income outstripped the national average. Earlier, it had rebounded more slowly from the Great Recession. Reasons for the gains Economist Brian Jacobsen said the uptick in personal income is due to a combination of gains in 2014 and government policies that depressed incomes in early 2013 (the comparison time period). "Not only was there the ‘fiscal cliff,’ which encouraged businesses to pay dividends in the fourth quarter of 2012 instead of the first quarter of 2013," Jacobsen said. "There was also the expiration of the payroll tax holiday and some changes to farm subsidies." Additionally, farm income didn’t drop nearly as much in Wisconsin as in nearby states, said Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls: "The fact that Wisconsin’s agricultural programs didn’t lose as many subsidies as other programs helped." Jacobsen said the best relative performers in the Wisconsin economy have been nondurable goods manufacturing; real estate and rental; management of companies and enterprises; administrative and waste management services; arts/entertainment/recreation; and state and local government. "More business friendly policies have been helping, but so has the general pick-up in the U.S. economy," he said. Before we close up shop, let’s answer how it is aggregate income can be rising faster here than the rest of the Midwest, even while job growth is dead last? One answer is how the government defines "personal income" -- it’s a broader measure than than wages from a job. The three components: -- Net earnings from wages and salaries and bonuses, plus the current-production income of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and tax-exempt cooperatives; -- Rental income, personal dividends and interest -- Transfer payments, such as Social Security and Medicare and unemployment, by all units of government and business. For much of 2013, Wisconsin’s personal income growth was faster in that second category than in wages from employment, the figures show. That shifted in the first quarter of 2014, when job earnings growth far outpaced the other two categories. And therein lies the second answer. We have the income estimates for the first quarter of 2014, but the jobs data is less up to date. The most reliable jobs data has not yet been released for early 2014. Our rating Walker tweeted that "Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year." The governor correctly identified a good-news trend that has seen Wisconsin boost its status from a laggard to a leader on total personal income, including wages, property income and government assistance.

pomt-09207	In Afghanistan "the (military) leadership has proposed a new medal, an award for 'Courageous Restraint' ... for 'NOT FIRING BACK.' "	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/may/21/allen-west/west-claims-military-leadership-afghanistan-propos/	Allen West is a Republican and retired lieutenant colonel who is running for a South Florida congressional seat currently held by Democrat Ron Klein. On a blog on his campaign website, he criticizes what he says is a proposed new medal for troops for "not firing back." Here is an excerpt from his May 16, 2010, blog: "Speaking of miscalculation, the latest from Afghanistan is that the leadership has proposed a new medal, an award for 'Courageous Restraint.' Yes, you heard me right, the military leadership in Afghanistan is considering awarding combat troops for 'NOT FIRING BACK.' There have been some fairly insidious plans proposed in the history of warfare, but never an award for Warriors to not fight. I know, the liberal intellectual elites are going to call me brutish and mean. The leadership proposing this inane action is going to say, 'it is about protecting the Afghan civilians.' My retort is simple, and comes from two opposing Civil War Generals; General Wm T Sherman, 'War is hell' and Cavalry General N Bedford Forest, 'War is about fighting, and fighting means killing.' If we do not want our Men and Women in combat to fight and kill the enemy, I say we retrograde from Afghanistan. The promotion of hesitation in combat by senior military leaders means that more of our American treasure will lose their lives and be forever maimed. I have been in a firefight, it is about gaining and maintaining the initiative, not restraint." The part of West's claim that we wanted to explore was whether "the leadership has proposed a new medal, an award for 'Courageous Restraint' ... for 'not firing back.' " The discussion about such a medal comes at a time when coalition forces have struggled to reduce civilian casualties. "That downward trend has abruptly been reversed: In the first three months of 2010, at least 72 Afghan civilians were accidentally killed by troops, compared to about 30 killed in the same period last year, according to a NATO official in Kabul,'' stated an April 30, 2010, New York Times article. On the subject of a new medal, we found a few news sources discussing the topic in May 2010. A May 4 Associated Press article stated that in an effort to reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan, commanders were considering awarding soliders for "courageous restraint." "The concept comes as the coalition continues to struggle with the problem of civilian casualties despite repeated warnings from the top NATO commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, that the war effort hinges on the ability to protect the population and win support away from the Taliban,'' the AP stated. "Those who back the idea hope it will provide soldiers with another incentive to think twice before calling in an airstrike or firing at an approaching vehicle if civilians could be at risk." British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, a NATO commander in Afghanistan, proposed the idea during a visit by Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Hall to Kandahar Airfield in mid April, the AP wrote. McChrystal was reviewing the proposal, according to the article, which stated that NATO wasn't planning to create a new medal, but use existing ones to recognize those who show restraint. A May 7 article in the Washington Examiner stated that the proposal had sparked concern among U.S. soldiers because among other reasons one captain said it could lead to second-guessing decisions. The article stated that Lt. Col. Edward Sholtis (who also goes by the name of Tadd), a spokesman for McChrystal, said no final decision had been made on the award. "The idea is being reviewed at headquarters ISAF (International Security Assistance Force)," Sholtis said. "The idea is consistent with our approach. Our young men and women display remarkable courage every day, including situations where they refrain from using lethal force, even at risk to themselves, in order to prevent possible harm to civilians. ... That restraint is an act of discipline and courage not much different than those seen in combat actions." When we contacted military sources directly about West's claim, we got a slightly different story. Here's Col. Wayne M. Shanks, U.S. Army Chief of Public Affairs International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, answering PolitiFact Florida by e-mail: "There's no proposal to create a new medal. This was an idea floated by the commander of Regional Command South, Maj. Gen. Nick Carter (UK), which unfortunately got reported in the press before it had received any serious attention from folks here. Because some reporters pounced on it and reported it as fact, the idea acquired a specificity that it never really possessed. As Gen. McChrystal said at his Pentagon press conference Thursday (May 13), he doesn't think we need a new medal to differentiate different kinds of courage." The transcript from the May 13 news briefing shows the following question was posed to McChrystal: "Is it true that you are contemplating -- awarding some sort of special honor for soldiers who make a special effort to avoid civilian casualties?" McChrystal: "The issue of courage -- we have a number of ways to recognize courage in uniform. And I think courage in uniform can come under enemy fire in the most traditional ways, or it can come under actions that may not be as expected or as traditional -- involve killing the enemy; it may involve protecting civilians. There's a great photograph from the Marja operation. I think it's a U.S. Marine shielding an Afghan man and an Afghan child with his own body. He wasn't shooting anyone; he didn't kill any Taliban; but I would argue that he showed as much courage as any that I've seen on the battlefield. So when we talk about courage, I think -- I don't think we need a different medal to differentiate different kinds of courage. " Sholtis, the public affairs officer for ISAF, provided a similar account to PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail: "The idea came up in a discussion between the commander of Regional Command South, UK Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, and Command Sergeant Major Mike Hall, ISAF's top enlisted soldier, and it was also posted to the ISAF website where it was picked up by reporters. However, at the time (and in the article) CSM Hall said the intent was not to create a new medal but to use existing medals to recognize heroism displayed in ways other than combat with the enemy -- for example, in protecting civilians. A subsequent article quoted me as saying that the idea of submitting troops for an award under those circumstances was consistent with our approach to counterinsurgency and was under review. The 'under review' bit was misinterpreted as confirming that the idea of a new medal was under review, which a number of commentators weighed in on over a news cycle or two. However, it was not the case that a formal proposal for a new medal was under review." Sholtis added: "We have no documentation accepting or rejecting the idea of recognizing courage demonstrated in restraint with an existing award because it is only an idea -- not a formal proposal." We did find one item written by the military about it: "Honoring Courageous Restraint" on the International Security Assistance Force website. That article stated "there should be an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the troops who exhibit extraordinary courage and self control by not using their weapons..." When we contacted the West campaign for any information to support the claim, campaign manager Josh Grodin told us, "That was his opinion. It took a 2-second Google search to see the VFW is discussing the same opinion about the proposed medal." So where does that leave us? West said that "the leadership has proposed a new medal, an award for 'Courageous Restraint' ... for 'NOT FIRING BACK.' " It's clear that military commanders did discuss rewarding troops for "Courageous Restraint," but with existing medals, not a new medal. And military officials who talked to PolitiFact said it was an idea, not a formal proposal. Given those facts, we rule this Half True.

pomt-07914	President Barack Obama supports immigration amnesty.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/01/paul-broun/congressman-tweets-obama-wants-amnesty-during-stat/	Shouting "you lie" at President Barack Obama? That’s so 2009. During 2011’s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, lobbed his real-time critiques in the form of tweets, all from his office. "Mr. President, you don’t believe in the Constitution. You believe in socialism," Broun posted on his Twitter account. "Obama’s policies kill free-enterprise," said another. Broun made headlines. Critics noted how his tone clashed with the conciliatory one politicians struck after the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Jan. 8. We took notice because Broun addressed a subject that’s been on our minds: immigration policy. "President Obama is calling for amnesty," Broun tweeted. We’ve never heard Obama say he supports "amnesty," but we’ve heard his opponents say over and again that he does. So is the president for or against it? Broun spokeswoman Debbee Keller said the tweet responded to a reference Obama made in his speech to the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which failed during last year’s lame-duck session. It would have allowed illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children to become citizens if they attend college or serve in the military. The DREAM Act would affect a smaller segment of the country’s roughly 11.1 million illegal immigrants than a Republican effort that failed in 2007 under President George W. Bush. That proposal would have granted temporary legal status to nearly all illegal immigrants in the country while allowing them to apply for residence and eventual citizenship. By definition, "amnesty" means to overlook an offense, Keller said. Since the DREAM Act would have forgiven certain people for immigrating to the U.S. illegally, it counts as amnesty. Simple enough, right? Well, maybe. Maybe not. Opponents to the DREAM Act criticize it by calling it "amnesty." Backers of the legislation don’t. They prefer "legalization" and "earned legalization" because "amnesty" has such negative overtones. Obama doesn’t use "amnesty" either. In an official position statement on the broader topic of immigration reform, he says "the immigration debate has often been portrayed as a false choice between amnesty and mass deportation." We talked to Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. The group believes fewer immigrants should be allowed into the U.S. It thinks the DREAM Act has some merits but needs major revisions. We also talked to Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that has studied the DREAM Act. Camarota and Rosenblum noted that under existing DREAM Act proposals, forgiveness comes with strings attached. Rosenblum emphasized that it grants citizenship only under certain conditions that many may be unable to meet. According to the MPI’s July 2010 analysis, slightly more than 2.1 million youths and young adults could be eligible to apply for legal status if the legislation were enacted. But historical trends indicate that only 38 percent would likely be able to complete the requirements to become permanent, legal residents. That’s because the odds are against them. Dropout rates for Hispanic youths are at about 20 percent, vs. 5 percent for non-Hispanic whites. Many live at 200 percent of the poverty rate or lower, a group that tends to complete college associate’s degrees at lower rates. We found the DREAM Act’s strings are bigger than those in the U.S.’ only major legalization program, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That legislation, which was described as "amnesty" at the time, had no college education or military service requirement. Illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982; were not felons or convicted of three or more misdemeanors in the U.S.; and demonstrated a basic knowledge of English and American history and government. Both experts agreed that the term "amnesty" is so charged that it complicates the debate. Since 1986, it has become "a bad word," Rosenblum said. Rosenblum does not describe the DREAM Act as "amnesty." Unlike the 1986 bill, the DREAM Act requires that when they apply, they commit to future actions -- such as completing two years of college -- in order to gain legal permanent residence. This means it will be easier to monitor for fraud and compliance. Rosenblum also notes it bears significant resemblance to another already-existing "earned" path to citizenship. Currently, foreigners under the H1B temporary work visa can petition to earn their green card. Camarota thinks the DREAM Act amounts to amnesty. He notes that one of the reasons some DREAM Act backers avoid the word is that it doesn’t do well in focus groups. But more to the point, just because the DREAM Act attaches conditions to forgiveness doesn’t mean it’s not amnesty, he said. Amnesty for offenses such as unpaid taxes or parking tickets typically include conditions. "This is like a parking tax amnesty or a tax amnesty. ... It’s not that different from 1986," Camarota said. So what does this mean? We found that people who like elements of the bill, not just its opponents, can make good arguments that "amnesty" is appropriate based on the bill’s specifics and past examples. You can also use that information to make a good argument that the label is inaccurate. And so here we have a case where in the middle of the State of the Union address, and in the midst of a years-long debate on a vexing issue, Broun uses a tweet to label Obama’s policy "amnesty." The tweet was unequivocal and without nuance. But the label is debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation. Broun’s statement is accurate but leaves out important details. It meets PolitiFact’s definition of Half True.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-02-01T06:00:00	2011-01-25	['Barack_Obama']

The photo suggests that former first lady is campaigning for election in 2020. This photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Obamas did pose for the photo, but the image was doctored to misrepresent the text of the t-shirt (which is white in the original photo). In June 26, 2015, then-president Barack Obama tweeted from his @POTUS44 account the picture of him and his wife. The actual shirt that he was holding said "Hate Won’t Win." That text was typed at the center of two hands creating the heart symbol. (Michelle Obama is making the same sign.) The tweet also said, "So inspired by the grace shown by the Simmons family and all the victims' families in Charleston. #HateWontWin." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Obama post came days after a deadly mass shooting by a white supremacist at a predominantly black church in Charleston, S.C. A movement called "Hate Won’t Win" emerged after the shooting, to "create a more culturally cohesive society that appreciates and celebrates differences instead of allowing them to divide us." It encouraged people to show "an act of love to someone of a different race, religion, economic class, age, etc. by posting a picture or video to your social media page with the hashtag, #hatewontwin" and to challenge others to do the same. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, names of democrats have been floated around speculating whether they would run against President Donald Trump. Michelle Obama has shut down any speculation that she might run. "I don’t want to be president. I don’t think I should be president. I think I can do a lot of things, but that’s not one of them,’’ Obama said during conference in Boston in April. She’s made no public indication that she’s interested in running for any other public office. A viral image suggesting Michelle Obama is running for public office in 2020 is fake.

pomt-10173	John McCain wants to "give oil companies another $4-billion" in tax breaks.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/barack-obama/better-context-for-a-once-questionable-tax-claim/	During the presidential debate, John McCain and Barack Obama sparred over taxes. McCain discussed his support for a reduction in corporate tax rates, which he said would help create jobs. A few moments later, he criticized Obama for voting for the 2005 energy bill, which McCain said was full of unnecessary spending. "It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments," McCain said. "It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Sen. Obama voted for it." "John, you want to give oil companies another $4-billion," Obama retorted. We've checked the controversy over Obama's energy vote previously . We found the bill, which did become law, included both incentives for clean energy and tax breaks for oil companies. Obama has said he felt the good in the bill outweighed the bad. Here, we'll look at Obama's claim that McCain wants to give oil companies $4-billion in tax breaks, a claim he's made several times. The Obama campaign defends this claim because McCain supports cutting corporate taxes, reducing them from a maximum rate of 35 percent to a maximum rate of 25 percent. Based on that tax change, the Obama campaign estimates that oil companies would save $4-billion a year. Specifically, they cite a study from the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund. That group analyzed financial statements from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the five largest oil companies and calculated current and deferred taxes paid in 2007 to the federal government for income earned from U.S. operations. They then calculated how much less those companies would pay if the corporate tax rate were dropped from 35 percent to 25 percent. The total savings to the five oil companies, $3.8-billion; $1.2-billion Exxon Mobil alone. In our previous look at this $4-billion claim, Obama didn't mention McCain's position on cutting corporate taxes for all companies. We concluded that Obama was cherry-picking by singling out oil companies. That led us to rule his statement Barley True. But at the debate, the two candidates had just discussed McCain's position on corporate taxes and were talking about how overarching policy could affect tax breaks for oil companies. The context of the exchange explained McCain's overall policy on corporate taxes. As a result, when Obama made the claim in the debate, it was True.

pomt-11578	"45.6 million people watched (the State of the Union), the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/01/donald-trump/trump-state-union-ratings-not-highest-history/	Television ratings have long been a fixation for former reality TV star President Donald Trump, so it’s no wonder he shined a spotlight on the ratings for his first State of the Union. "Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart!" Trump tweeted on Feb. 1, 2018. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump exaggerated crowd sizes before, so we wondered whether ratings backed up his latest boast. His claim about Fox News holds up, but not so much for total State of the Union viewership. State of the Union ratings The Nielsen Company, the primary collector of television ratings data, indeed reported that 45.6 million Americans above the age of 2 tuned into the president’s address across 12 networks between 9 and 10:30 p.m. That wasn’t a record, though. Trump came in sixth in total State of the Union viewers since Nielsen began collecting the data in 1993. George W. Bush garnered 62 million viewers in 2003; Bill Clinton 53 million in 1998; W. Bush 51.8 million in 2002; Obama 48 million in 2010; and Clinton 45.8 million in 1994. The ranking is even lower when we also count first addresses to the Joint Sessions of Congress. That’s the first-term equivalent of the State of the Union, but the president is assumed to be too new to describe how the nation is faring. Including those addresses, Trump’s State of the Union ranks ninth, outdone by his own first address to the Joint Sessions of Congress, which had 47.7 million viewers. Clinton ranks first with 66.9 viewers in 1993, and Obama’s 2009 address had 53.2 million viewers. When we asked about the "highest number in history," the White House said Trump had been talking about cable news history. That works only if we exclude Trump’s Joint Address to Congress in 2017 and only include the three major cable networks (CNN, Fox News Network and MSNBC) dating back to 2001, when all three aired the address. Nielsen does not track State of the Union viewership from cable and broadcast networks separately, so we tallied up ratings for the major networks across the years. That wasn’t clear in the tweet, however, as the 45.6 million people encompassed watchers of both cable and broadcast networks. Fox News Fox News had an average of 11.5 million viewers between 9 and 10:30 p.m., according to Nielsen. Using the same data set, Fox reported 11.7 million viewers between 9:15 to 10:30 p.m. (The speech ran from 9:09 to 10:30 p.m.) That was a record high for Fox News during a State of the Union speech. It came in second for a presidential address to Congress only to Trump’s Address to the Joint Sessions of Congress last year. Fox indeed beat out the other major networks, as Trump claimed. CNN raked in 3.1 million viewers and MSNBC had 2.7 million viewers during the State of the Union. ABC delivered 5.4 million viewers, NBC 7.1 million, CBS 7 million and FOX 3.6 million, according to Nielsen. If, as the White House explained, Trump was talking only about cable news networks, that wasn’t the first time Fox News beat out the other cable networks during a State of the Union address. While the time stamps vary slightly for each network, Fox beat out CNN and MSNBC every year according to Nielsen, save for 2016. Our ruling Trump said "45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in." 45.6 million people watched Trump’s State of the Union, but that wasn’t the highest number in history. Five other State of the Union speeches raked in more viewers, and eight other presidential addresses to joint sessions of Congress did, too. If we only look at cable news airings of the State of the Union among the major networks, this year indeed raked in the highest numbers. That wasn’t clear in the tweet. Fox News delivered 11.7 million viewers for the duration of the president’s speech, give or take a few minutes. It beat every other network airing the speech. That wasn’t a first, though, as the network’s ratings have consistently beaten other cable providers’ during the event. Given the misleading nature of the first statement, and the accuracy of the second, we rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12453	District attorneys "have advertised that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a United States citizen, so they won’t be deported."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/10/jeff-sessions/sessions-claims-district-attorneys-charge-immigran/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions raised concerns to New York law enforcement officers over practices of some district attorneys that he said favored immigrants. "It troubles me that we’ve seen district attorneys openly brag about not charging cases appropriately under the laws of our country, so that provides an opportunity for individuals not to be convicted of a crime that might lead to deportation," Sessions said April 28 in Long Island, N.Y. "Some have advertised that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a United States citizen, so they won’t be deported. That baffles me." Is Sessions right about district attorneys advertising leniency in charges toward immigrants over U.S. citizens? The Justice Department, led by Sessions, referred us to policies and practices of the Brooklyn District Attorney, Santa Clara District Attorney and Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office. While all three jurisdictions refuted Sessions’ characterization of their policies, we found that some offices are considering alternative offenses a defendant can plead to in order to avoid "disproportionate collateral consequences," such as deportation. They also point to a U.S. Supreme Court case that said considering deportation consequences in the plea-bargaining process may be a wise move for defendants and states. Here’s an overview of those policies. Brooklyn Sessions spoke about "criminal aliens," a term generally applied to non-U.S. citizens – living in the United States legally or illegally – who are convicted of crimes. On April 24, Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced a new policy for the handling of cases against non-U.S. citizens defendants, designed to minimize "collateral immigration consequences of criminal convictions, particularly for misdemeanor and other low-level offenses." The office hired immigration attorneys to advise prosecutors when making plea offers and sentencing recommendations for non-U.S. citizen defendants, the DA said in a news release. Certain convictions put immigrants in the country illegally at risk for being a priority for deportation. For instance, the state misdemeanor of possession of marijuana is a felony for immigration purposes, but trespassing is not, the DA’s office said. As a result, attorneys may consider "reasonable modifications" in sentence recommendations and alternative offenses that a defendant can plead to in order to reach an "immigration-neutral disposition," the policy said. In certain cases, a non-U.S. citizen if appropriate may be offered a plea for a lesser offense "in light of the disproportionate immigration consequences a higher level offense may result in," the office said in its release. "When possible, the alternative should be similar in level of offense and length of sentence to that offered to a citizen defendant, while the charge may be different," the Brooklyn DA said. Sessions said DAs advertise "that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense," but a spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA said their policy "does not pertain to charging decisions." But rather to the sentencing recommendations and offenses to which defendants can plead, which happens after charges are made. "The charges decision is completely neutral. The charges happen before there’s even thought about immigration status," Oren Yaniv, spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA’s Office told PolitiFact. It’s toward the end of the case when the office takes into consideration their policy, he said. The American Bar Association describes the plea bargaining process as involving "the defendant's pleading guilty to a lesser charge, or to only one of several charges. It also may involve a guilty plea as charged, with the prosecution recommending leniency in sentencing." The policy "does not create two systems of justice, one for immigrants and one for citizens, as some have alleged," Oren Yaniv, spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA’s Office told PolitiFact. The goal of policies like the one in Brooklyn is to ensure that appropriate pleas are offered and entered in light that deportation might also be added onto any criminal penalties, said Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. "Rather than ‘special treatment,’ the policy might be looked at as trying to ensure that the punishment fits the crime," Johnson said. Santa Clara In September 2011, Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen issued a memo to fellow prosecutors for the consideration of "collateral consequences" in certain cases. The consideration should not apply to cases involving a serious or violent felony, he said. The memo said a prosecutor may alter a charge toward an "immigration-neutral result," where the conviction does not lead to deportation. "The contention that we charge an immigrant with a ‘lesser’ offense is false. In some appropriate cases, we agree to immigration-neutral charges, but as a practical matter this results in a longer sentence or greater number of charges -- or a quicker guilty plea," Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen told PolitiFact. "Our collateral consequences policy -- which can also factor in employment, education, housing, pregnancy-- is open to both citizens and non-citizens." Rosen cited the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court case Padilla vs. Kentucky, which centered on a lawful permanent U.S. resident facing deportation after pleading guilty to drug distribution charges in Kentucky. The defendant claimed his counsel failed to effectively advise him that pleading to that charge could lead to deportation. The U.S. Supreme Court held that counsel must inform a client whether a plea carries a risk of deportation. Justices also noted that prosecutors and defense attorneys may consider immigration consequences when negotiating a settlement, and that this could better satisfy the interest of both parties, Rosen said. Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said the main obligations are for criminal defense attorneys, who should not accept a plea for their client that would have negative immigration consequences unless they advise the client specifically about those consequences. The underlying proposition, Gilman said, is that the whole criminal justice system (including prosecutors) must understand immigration consequences to be tightly intertwined with criminal consequences. The Supreme Court’s opinion was recently enshrined into California law, Rosen said. Part of that law says the prosecution "shall consider the avoidance of adverse immigration consequences in the plea negotiation process as one factor in an effort to reach a just resolution." Baltimore The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office issued a news release May 4 saying it had instructed prosecutors to "strongly consider their prosecutorial discretion" related to minor, non-violent criminal cases that involve immigrant victims, witnesses and defendants. The Baltimore Sun reported the directive April 28. Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said prosecutorial discretion should be used to consider "the unintended collateral consequences that our decisions have on our immigrant population." The release did not specify what the prosecutorial discretion entailed. Our ruling Sessions said district attorneys "advertise that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a United States citizen." District and state attorneys in Brooklyn, Santa Clara and Baltimore have issued directives for prosecutorial discretion in the handling of non-violent cases involving non-U.S. citizens (which includes immigrants living in the United States legally and illegally). Attorneys told us that the alternative sentences are designed to help people avoid deportation for minor crimes, and that sometimes the plea deals mean the person ends up with a stricter or longer sentence, or a faster guilty plea. They also contend that they are not charging immigrants favorably over citizens, as policy consideration goes into effect after charges are made. The Supreme Court recently recognized that deportations can represent a disproportionate punishment. A recent case found that defense attorneys must inform their clients when a plea carries a risk of deportation. Justices also noted that considering deportation consequences in the plea bargaining process may benefit both defendants and states. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06171	DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz "denied unemployment went up under Obama."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/dec/15/republican-national-committee-republican/did-dnc-chair-wasserman-schultz-deny-unemployment-/	Bloggers could not believe it. South Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, insisted on national television that unemployment did not increase under President Barack Obama. "Denial — it ain’t just a river in Egypt," wrote HotAir.com blogger Ed Morrissey. "Appearing on Fox News this morning, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insisted that unemployment didn’t go up in Barack Obama’s term of office, a hilarious argument on several levels." Morrissey blogged about a 4-minute interview between Wasserman Schultz and Gretchen Carlson, co-host of Fox and Friends, on Dec. 12, 2011. Their back-and-forth over unemployment inspired the Republican National Committee press team to package Morrissey's post with several other accounts in an e-mail blast to political reporters. "This morning Delusional Debbie denied unemployment went up under Obama -– a claim now gracing Drudge Report and a number of other news sites," the RNC e-mail read. "Either Wasserman Schultz needs to study up (here are the stats for her: from BLS.gov: unemployment January ’09: 7.8 percent, unemployment November ’11: 8.6 percent), or she’s deliberately trying to deceive Americans." We think the interview -- and what exactly Wasserman Schultz and Carlson said -- warrants another look. Here's a transcript of the exchange (distilled here in a 40-second video), which came on the heels of talk of GOP presidential candidates and Obama's understanding of the economy. Carlson: "Unemployment has gone up precipitously since he (Obama) took office." Wasserman Schultz: "That is simply not true." Carlson: "Yes it is." Wasserman Schultz: "In fact, unemployment has now dropped below 9 percent. It's continuing to drop. He's been focused on..." Carlson: "But it's higher than when they promised that the stimulus would lower it to 8 percent ..." Wasserman Schultz: "See, that narrative doesn’t work for you anymore, though, because when President Obama…" Carlson: "It's not my narrative. I'm just talking about facts, where the unemployment numbers are." Wasserman Schultz: "You just said that the unemployment rate has been going up since he took office, and it hasn't." Carlson: "Is unemployment higher now than when President Obama took office?" Wasserman Schultz: "What’s happened since President Obama took office..." Carlson: "Is unemployment higher than he took office?" Wasserman Schultz: "Unemployment is nearing right around where it was when President Obama took office and it's dropping. You just said that it's been increasing, and that's not true." A quick note about the back-and-forth. Carlson said "they," meaning the White House, promised the stimulus would lower unemployment to 8 percent. We rated nearly identical claims from House Speaker John Boehner and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann Mostly False. But for this fact-check, we're honing in on whether Wasserman Schultz denied that the unemployment rate has increased since Obama took office. There is no denying the rate is higher now (8.6 percent in November 2011) than it was in February 2009, Obama's first full month in office (8.2, which itself was up .4 percentage points from January 2009). Bloggers pointed to this and other workforce figures to emphasize the silliness of Wasserman Schultz's (supposed) insistence that unemployment is not up since Obama took office. "Maybe the DNC should consider having a chair who has some connection to reality," Morrissey wrote. An analysis of the Fox interview shows the conversation didn't go down that way, though a quick look at Wasserman Schultz's quotes (i.e. "That is simply not true") may lead someone to believe it. The host and guest's back-and-forth is pretty muddy, stuffed with implications and ignored points. It's mostly confusing because Carlson and Wasserman Schultz refuse to share a frame of discussion. Carlson wants to talk about how unemployment is higher since Obama took office, but she uses a misleading word, precipitously, to start it off. Wasserman Schultz ignores Carlson's larger point and reacts instead to her interpretation of what Carlson said, that unemployment is rising. There are grains of truth. We consulted professional linguists and economists to help us find them. Carlson may have been trying to state the obvious -- that unemployment is up since Obama's first day -- when she segued into the unemployment discussion. Her use of "precipitously," though, immediately changed the tone and put Wasserman Schultz on defense. The word could be a fair choice to describe the jump from the April 2008 unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, with President George W. Bush at the nation's helm, to the Obama-led October 2009 rate of 10.1. An increase of 5.2 percentage points in an 18-month span is indeed precipitous, said Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. About half of that increase happened in Bush's tenure, though, he added. The word is not accurate if you interpret Carlson as saying unemployment is rising precipitously now, as Wasserman Schultz did and as most people would, said Alec Marantz, New York University linguistics and psychology professor. "If Carlson meant, 'Unemployment is significantly higher than when Obama took office,' what she said doesn't convey that," Marantz said. "The use of the adverb 'precipitously' suggests a steady, steep upward slope, which corresponds only to the beginning of Obama's presidency, not to a period between 'since he took office' and now." The jobless rate has tapered off since its October 2009 peak, lingering mainly within the range of 9.2 and 8.8 percent. The most recent rate available is 8.6 percent, its lowest point since March 2009. Wasserman Schultz wants viewers to consider the zigs and zags of unemployment data because they cast the administration's record in a more promising light. This explains why she immediately responds to Carlson with, "That's simply not true." She isn't denying unemployment has gone up, but that it has gone up "precipitously." Carlson tries to adjust her point so that it's about "where the unemployment numbers are." So she asks Wasserman Schultz, "Is unemployment higher now than when President Obama took office?" The answer is an unequivocal yes. But Wasserman Schultz does not offer a direct answer. Her response, "Unemployment is nearing right around where it was when President Obama took office and it's dropping," implies the rate has increased but articulates that unemployment is going down. It's not a denial; it's a dodge. Wasserman Schultz sees Carlson's point but wants to shift to recent declining jobless numbers under Obama for political reasons. And to be clear, the national unemployment rate is "nearing" the January 2009 rate of 7.8 percent, and it's even closer if you take the February 2009 number, Burtless said. But it's not yet "near," he said. Our ruling The enemy of clarity is cross-talk. The twists and implications in this conversation happen fast and are not explained to viewers, leaving some with the impression that Wasserman Schultz emphatically disagrees with the fact that there are more people without jobs today than in early 2009. The devil is usually in the details, however, and in this case, Carlson's start to the conversation did not express exactly that. Did Wasserman Schultz really insist that unemployment did not go up during Obama’s term, as claimed by bloggers and then propagated by the Republican National Committee? No. Wasserman Schultz insisted something else -- that it hadn't gone up precipitously and that it is not going up. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01313	Says Scott Walker "gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/28/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-scott-walker-deal-lets-company-kee/	Before introducing former President Bill Clinton at an Oct. 24, 2014 campaign event in Milwaukee, Democrat Mary Burke leveled a number of criticisms at her election rival, Gov. Scott Walker. Including this one: "He gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce." Typically, when the state offers financial assistance to a company, the company has to create jobs. So what’s going on here? The deal Burke was alluding to a deal offered by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to Ashley Furniture Industries. WEDC is the state’s primary agency for helping businesses create jobs. Walker created it to replace the state Department of Commerce; he heads the WEDC board. Ashley Furniture, based in Arcadia in western Wisconsin, is the country's largest furniture manufacturer and retailer. The deal for the furniture company was reported in late-August 2014 by the Wisconsin State Journal. According to the Madison newspaper, the WEDC board in January 2014 approved a $6 million enterprise zone tax credit that would help Ashley Furniture with a $35 million expansion of its headquarters. More specifically, the $6 million would pay for the relocation of Meyers Valley Creek, which flooded downtown Arcadia and the Ashley plant in 2010, allowing for the company to launch a 480,000-square foot expansion to reconfigure and change the layout of production lines. The company, which the State Journal said had 3,848 Wisconsin employees at the time, did not have to commit to create a certain number of jobs. In fact, the credits would remain in place even if the company laid off as much as half of its workforce within the next several years. Quoting a memo to the WEDC board, the newspaper reported that Ashley Furniture had indicated "that if the project is not undertaken, it will either downsize or close the Arcadia manufacturing plant completely." So, based on what the company was telling the WEDC, the agency was motivated to try to stop the loss of many jobs. The tax credits deal had not been made public because WEDC had not finalized a contract with Ashley Furniture, although the company confirmed to the newspaper that it was seeking state subsidies that include terms allowing for job reductions. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel followed up on the story. Ashley confirmed that the deal would allow the tax credits to stand even if Ashley cut up to half its Wisconsin employment. But the company said it was advertising 200 job openings and had no plans to cut jobs in western Wisconsin. The company said the layoff provision was meant to cover a worst-case scenario -- protecting the company, for example, in case a disastrous fire or flood should force a shutdown and layoffs. Moreover, the deal amounts to a pass-through, rather than cash in Ashley’s pocket, given that the company would be donating $6 million to the City of Arcadia for the flood-control project. WEDC spokesman Mark Maley told us that the WEDC board has discussed giving the tax credits to Ashley for the flood-control project. He would not release details of the board’s closed-door meeting at which the credits were approved, saying there still is not yet a signed contract between the agency and the furniture maker. But he said: "WEDC is committed to doing whatever it can to work with the company and preserve those jobs." Our rating Burke said Walker "gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce." Walker heads the board of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., and that board has approved $6 million in tax credits to aid an expansion of Ashley Furniture. The tax credits would be used toward a flood-control project in the city where the furniture maker is headquartered, but the project clearly is part of the company’s plan to expand. If Ashley did lay off half its workforce, the credits could still remain in place, but since they would be used for a flood-control project, it’s not as though the company could "keep the money." For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-05352	Says Lee Leffingwell "raised property taxes 20 percent in three years."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/may/11/brigid-shea/brigid-shea-says-lee-leffingwell-raised-austins-ta/	Brigid Shea, running for mayor of Austin against incumbent Lee Leffingwell and activist Clay Dafoe, sent a mailer we spotted May 7, 2012, including a double-digit claim about hizzoner and taxes. "Lee raised property taxes 20 percent in three years," the mailer says. All that much, and by his lonesome? Fortuitously, we had in hand a chart provided by the Travis Central Appraisal District showing the tax rate set by the Austin City Council each year from 1990-91 through 2011-12. Before Leffingwell was elected mayor, the council set a rate of 40.12 cents per $100 of appraised value for 2008-09, meaning the fiscal year through September 2009. Last year, the Leffingwell-led council set a rate of 48.11 cents for 2011-12. Put another way, the liability on a property valued at $100,000 before Leffingwell became mayor was $401.20. The liability in 2011-12 was $481.10. On its face, that’s a 20 percent increase over three years -- as referenced on the flip side of Shea's mailer, which says: "Lee voted to raise your property tax rate 20 percent in three years." But no mayor can set a tax rate on his or her own, which Shea knows because she’s a former council member. Each year, the seven-member council votes on the rate as it completes the city’s budget. In Austin’s form of government, the mayor has one vote, like fellow council members. Asked by email about Shea’s claim, the mayor’s campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said: "Lee did not raise these taxes — the Austin City Council raised these taxes." Another wrinkle: Leffingwell, a retired airline pilot, was on the council before he ran for mayor and had a vote on city tax rates set for every budget starting in 2005-06. Through his council tenure, the tax rate has dipped and gone up, according to the appraisal district’s breakdown. In Leffingwell’s first year on the council, members kept the previous year’s rate of 44.30 cents per $100 in appraised value. Members cut the rate each of the next three years before raising it each of the next three years. Ed Van Eenoo, the city’s budget officer, told us the council voted 7-0 for the three tax-rate changes — all increases — with Leffingwell as mayor. However, tax-rate changes alone don’t reveal the pocketbook impact of city property taxes. Notably, for instance, Leffingwell said recently that Austin has the lowest tax rate by far of the five biggest Texas cities. That’s so, but we rated his claim Half True after pointing out that any touting of tax rates is incomplete if it fails to fold in how much property-owners actually pay out. That’s because property valuations and tax exemptions also influence what property owners pay. To gauge the property taxes owed the city, for instance, take your house’s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate — with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than "48.11 cents." Van Eenoo put it this way in an email reply to our inquiries about changes in the rates on the mayor’s watch: "Simply looking at tax rates does not provide a complete analysis as tax rates are heavily influenced by home values. When property values go up, the revenue needed to maintain operations can generally be achieved at a lower tax rate. Vice versa when values go down as they did in 2010 and 2011." One way to evaluate property tax rates without ignoring the role of home values, Van Eenoo said, is to compare the tax rate adopted by the council with what’s known as the "rollback rate." That’s the maximum rate the city is allowed to set under state law without triggering a voter referendum. The rollback rate, Van Eenoo told us, is calculated as the rate that would bring in 8 percent more in revenue for operations and maintenance than in the previous year, plus enough money to pay the coming year’s debt service. In keeping with the time period behind Shea’s claim, let’s focus on Leffingwell’s mayoral years. In his first year leading the council, the tax rate set by the council was the rollback rate, as it had been for the previous three years. In the latter two years of Leffingwell’s mayorship, the adopted tax rates were lower than the rollback rate, Van Eenoo said. In those years, then, the council didn’t raise taxes as much as it could have. Yet another measure that takes into account changes in property values is the "effective tax rate." That’s the rate that the city would have to set to bring in roughly the same amount of revenue it received the year before on properties taxed in both years. In each year of Leffingwell’s mayoral term, according to city data, the council’s adopted tax rate exceeded the effective rate; on average, the rate was nearly 4 percent higher. Looking beyond rates, we wondered how much typical homeowners’ city property tax bills had changed in the years Leffingwell has been mayor -- though we should note, of course, that the city is only one of the entities taxing Austin properties. Others include school districts, county government and community colleges. To support her statement that Leffingwell "raised property taxes 20 percent in three years," Shea sent us data that she said showed tax bills for Austin homeowners had increased more than that amount since Leffingwell became mayor. Shea’s analysis, which does not take into account exemptions, calculates annual tax bills using two different measures for home values: the median and average prices of homes sold in February of each year. Shea obtained the sales price information from the Texas A&M University Real Estate Center, which gathers data from real estate professionals across the state. Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a "middle" value — median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half the city's homes sold for more and half sold for less. For this reason, we put aside Shea’s data on average sale price and stuck with her figures for the median. Those show that the city tax bill for a home valued at the February median sales price increased about 23 percent from 2008-09 ($753) to 2011-12 ($924). Still, Shea’s data relies on the prices of homes sold in a single month each year. That’s a small pool. We wondered whether there was a better representation of a typical Austin homeowner’s property value. We found one in data from the city: annual "median taxable value." Samantha Park, a city spokeswoman, told us that the "taxable value" of a home is the amount on which the city can actually tax. It’s based on the appraised value, determined by the county’s assessment, minus exemptions. The "median taxable value," then, is the value at which half the city's homes were valued at more and half were valued at less. Next, we used the city’s data to calculate how much the city taxes on a home with the median taxable value had changed during Leffingwell’s mayoral term. Our calculations found an increase of about 25 percent from 2008-09 ($700) to 2011-12 ($877). That’s greater than the 20 percent Shea cited on her mailer. Another factor to consider: inflation. Adjusting Shea’s tax bill figures for inflation reduces the size of the increase during Leffingwell’s mayorship to about 18 percent. Doing the same to the figures in our analysis of city data reduces the property tax increase to about 20 percent. We ran our work by the city. Park told us that our calculations of the city-provided data were fine, but that she had a quibble with our use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index to account for inflation in property tax increases. The CPI, Park said, "takes into account the change in price for goods and services purchased by households, not government services that are provided," which is what taxpayers are funding through their property tax bills. And she suggested that rising prices may be hitting governments harder than consumers. To illustrate her point, she noted that the price of a gallon of milk rises more slowly than the price of health care services for city employees. Also, she said, our analysis does not consider the cost of "improvements in service delivery." As an example, she pointed to the City Council’s decision to turn the the city’s animal shelter into a "no-kill facility." We take this as saying the city chose to do more things — and those had costs. In response to the city’s concern about the CPI, we used a different index — one from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis that gauges inflation for state and local governments — to adjust the tax bill figures in Shea’s and our data. That reduces the increases by only half a percentage point compared to our calculations using the CPI. Our ruling Mindful that tax rates alone paint an incomplete picture of the impact of property taxes, which are also driven by changes in property values, we found that what a typical Austin homeowner — one with the median-value home — paid in taxes went up 25 percent in the three years that Leffingwell’s served as Austin mayor. Adjusted for inflation, that figure drops somewhat, but is still about 20 percent. So, taxes went up 20 percent, or more, with Leffingwell as mayor. However, no Austin mayor can raise taxes solo commando. Leffingwell had one of the seven votes that were cast each year in setting the city’s rates. This significant perspective is absent from Shea’s statement, making her claim Half True.	None	Brigid Shea	None	None	None	2012-05-11T12:05:44	2012-05-07	['None']

pomt-11761	"The violent crime rate has risen, and the homicide rate has risen by more than 20 percent in just two years, really after 30 years of decline in violent crime."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/04/jeff-sessions/violent-crime-some-still-well-historical-highs/	In Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ testimony to Congress about Russia in November, he brought up a recent increase in the rate of violent crime and murder in the United States. "The violent crime rate has risen, and the homicide rate has risen by more than 20 percent in just two years, really after 30 years of decline in violent crime," said Sessions on Nov. 14. We wanted to check out his numbers. Sessions got his information from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report for 2016. After doing some math, we found that from 2014 to 2016 violent crime rate increased by 6.8 percent, and the murder rate increased by 20.4 percent. The FBI defines violent crime as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Sessions’ numbers are accurate, but his focus on the more recent years doesn’t show the full picture. On average, for the last 30 years violent crime has been declining. In 1986, the violent crime rate was 620 violent crimes per 100,000 people. In 1991, the rate increased to 758, which was the highest it has been since 1960. "For 15 to 20 years both the violent and nonviolent crime rates as measured by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report (UCR) have been dropping like a rock. It is now at the level of the early 1950s. It is very low," said Alan Lizotte, a professor in the School of Criminal Justice at the University at Albany, in email correspondence with PolitiFact. The murder rate in 2014 was 4.4 murders per 100,000 people and in 2016 it was 5.3. Because the numbers are relatively small, a change in the rate is reflected as a seemingly larger percentage. "To be clear, you can have an uptick in crime from 2015 to 2016, and yet the numbers in 2016 are still lower than what they were a decade ago," said Kenneth Leon, professor at the George Washington University. "Sessions has a structural incentive to emphasize law-and-order-related rhetoric and make statements that suggest there is a crime wave, or that the U.S. is ‘less safe.’ He is selectively curating the data to fit his needs." Others see the increase as a worrying sign that could be the start of a new trend. Richard Rosenfeld, a professor at the University of Missouri St. Louis, shared a National Institute of Justice study he participated on that examined the recent rise in homicide in the United States. "If not wholly unprecedented, the recent homicide increase in the United States was relatively large, especially in several of the nation’s big cities," said the report. The report expressed concern at the sudden rise and said that it would take five years, if the rates continue to increase at high rates, for the homicide rates to reach the levels of the 1990s. Sessions gave a speech when this data was first released at the end of August and said that the work that law enforcement officers do is about to get harder. "That’s because we are fighting a multi-front battle: an increase in violent crime, a rise in vicious gangs, an opioid epidemic, threats from terrorism, combined with a culture in which family and discipline seem to be eroding further and a disturbing disrespect for the rule of law," said Sessions. The National Institute of Justice study explored the potential causes of the homicide increase but said that because it was such an abrupt increase, it was difficult to definitively say what the cause was. It encouraged further research. Our ruling Sessions said, "The violent crime rate has risen, and the homicide rate has risen by more than 20 percent in just two years, really after 30 years of decline in violent crime." That is accurate, but it needs additional information. The murder rate spoke is driven by a small increase in cases, and still well below historical highs. Experts say the increasing murder rate may be the start of a trend, or could be a random increase before a return to historic lows. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04253	Budget analysts say the looming tax hikes and spending cuts would "take us into a recession and kill jobs."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/15/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-cbo-warns-trip-over-fiscal-cliff-/	Here’s how you might explain Congress and tax cuts to a third grader: Congress cuts taxes, but it doesn’t necessarily make the cuts permanent. They last only as long as lawmakers can justify from a budgetary standpoint (more than a third grader needs to understand). Then the tax cuts expire, just as Congress mandated. And then Congress goes: OMG, taxes are about to rise. The same thing happens with scheduled spending cuts, or what lawmakers currently call sequestration. Congress in 2011 wrote a law mandating about $100 billion of them a year over a decade, starting in January 2013 and spread them across discretionary programs. These were supposed to be a poison pill as congressional negotiators tried to find some other way to stem the rising federal debt. But Congress failed, so the pill must be swallowed. The result of these spending and tax policies kicking in simultaneously is described as the looming "fiscal cliff." And one of last year’s negotiators, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, recently described the consequences of going over that cliff. In an interview with the Dallas Morning News, Portman said, "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has just told us that these massive tax increases and defense cuts, and other aspects of so-called sequestration, will take us into a recession and kill jobs." Did Portman accurately cite the CBO’s analysis? Could the cliff be that bad? According to the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the answer is yes -- for a while. On Nov. 8, the CBO posted a synopsis of a new report on its website, saying, "Significant tax increases and spending cuts are slated to take effect in January 2013, sharply reducing the federal budget deficit and causing, by CBO’s estimates, a decline in the nation’s economic output and an increase in unemployment. " How awful might these be? Allowing all of the scheduled tax hikes and spending cuts to take place would cut the gross domestic product, a measure of the nation’s economy, by 0.5 percent in 2013, says the full CBO report. Economic growth is already less than robust -- the third quarter GDP growth was 2.0 percent, below the historic average since 1947 of 3.25 percent but higher than the 1.3 percent in the previous quarter. A contraction in the economy would cost jobs, with the unemployment rate rising to 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, the CBO said. That compares with today’s national unemployment rate of 7.9. (The rate in Ohio is 7.0.) There are ways to temper the pain, however, which is why the CBO conducted its analysis. Congress could allow some but not all the tax cuts to expire. It could limit the immediate spending cuts. Each of these might soften the harsher consequences. So why not just stop the whole thing, extend all the tax cuts and keep spending money? Because the resulting national debt -- a result of tax revenue being inadequate to keep up with spending (the political parties disagree on which of these bears the most blame) -- would continue to drag down the economy. In fact, the CBO says that if the pending spending cuts and tax hikes are allowed to kick in as scheduled, "after next year, by the agency’s estimates, economic growth will pick up, and the labor market will strengthen." The unemployment rate would shrink to 5.5 percent by 2018, the CBO says. In other words, next year’s pain would lead to eventual gain. Conversely, the CBO says, if none of the tax cuts were to expire and government spending went on and on uninterrupted, "the economy would remain below its potential and the unemployment rate would remain higher than usual for some time." And if this continued indefinitely. the federal debt would keep surging, raising the risk of a crisis "in which the government would lose the ability to borrow money at affordable interest rates." So something must be done, or so you could assume from the CBO’s analysis. Congress just has to decide what and when. But with the economy still struggling and millions of Americans already looking for work, few lawmakers -- even the majority who agreed to the poison pill -- advocate tough fiscal medicine immediately. The CBO provided Congress with some economic assumptions as it weighs its options, including phasing in some changes and delaying others. And while Portman chose words with somewhat more rhetorical flair, his description of the consequences laid out in the CBO report is accurate. The CBO did not use the word "recession," as Portman did, but a recession is generally defined as an economic contraction in two consecutive quarters. That fits the CBO’s technical explanation -- a decline in GDP in the first half of 2013 -- and "recession" has been used in media reports as the shorthand.. Portman also is accurate when describing the potential for higher unemployment, based on the CBO report. It is important to note that Portman was not delivering a thesis on the CBO report. Rather, he was telling a newspaper interviewer about the desire to avoid the short-term pain while addressing the long-term problems. Whether his solutions, which include corporate tax reform, would work is immaterial here. His claim about the immediate consequences of going over the cliff, based on the CBO’s analysis, is True.

pomt-11585	"70 percent of the income tax that the state collects happens to come from Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and New York City"	true	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/01/robert-mujica/do-downstate-ny-residents-contribute-more-income-t/	More than two-thirds of income tax collected by New York state comes from downstate residents, the state’s budget chief said. "The reality is that 70 percent of the income tax that the state collects happens to come from Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and New York City," state Budget Director Robert Mujica said in a radio interview. Mujica was defending a proposal to overhaul the state’s tax code that would primarily benefit the state’s high-income earners. Many of the earners live in New York City and its suburban counties. Is Mujica right that 70 percent of the state’s income tax revenue comes from the New York City area? In context State lawmakers are considering several options to respond to the new federal tax code’s cap on state and local tax deductions. The new federal law caps those deductions at $10,000. One proposal would shift state income tax from the employee to the employer. Businesses and corporations can still deduct state and local taxes without a cap under the new tax law. The employee would no longer pay a state income tax, but the employer would take on a new, deductible tax. The shift would be voluntary. If a business did not want to make the change, it could choose not to do so. The proposal would primarily benefit residents with higher incomes who could no longer deduct their full income tax. Data The state collected more than $47.5 billion in income taxes in the last fiscal year, according to the state Division of Budget. About $19.2 billion, or 40 percent, came from New York City residents alone. Those in Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties paid $12.1 billion in state income taxes. The total for those in New York City and the three counties came to $31.3 billion, or 66 percent of the state total. Another $7.8 billion came from non-residents who commuted into New York state for work. Most of those filers worked in New York City, according to a spokesperson from the agency. If you add the revenue from non-residents to that of New York City, Westchester, and Long Island filers, the share increases to 82 percent of the state total. The New York City region’s high share of income tax revenue shouldn’t come as a surprise, considering its population. Close to 12.3 million people live in New York City, Westchester and on Long Island. That counts for about 62 percent of the state’s total population. Residents in upstate counties, meanwhile, paid close to $8.4 billion in income taxes, or about 18 percent of the state total. Our ruling Mujica said "70 percent of the income tax that the state collects happens to come from Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and New York City." The actual number is somewhere between 66 percent and 82 percent, according to data from the state Division of Budget. Upstate counties only provide about 18 percent of the state’s income tax revenue. We rate his claim True.

pomt-03422	As a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981, "there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-when-he-went-college-los-angeles/	When President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change on June 25, 2013, he reached back more than three decades for a personal anecdote to support his argument. "Now, what you'll hear from the special interests and their allies in Congress is that (my climate change plan) will kill jobs and crush the economy and basically end American free-enterprise as we know it," Obama said. "And the reason I know you'll hear those things is because that's what they said every time America sets clear rules and better standards for our air and our water and our children's health. "And every time they've been wrong," Obama continued. "when I was going to school in 1979, 1980 in Los Angeles, there were days where folks couldn't go outside -- and the sunsets were spectacular -- because of all the pollution in the air. "At the time when we passed the Clean Air Act, to try to get rid of some of this smog, some of the same doomsayers were saying, ‘New pollution standards will decimate the auto industry.’ Guess what? It didn't happen. Our air got cleaner." Many Twitter users asked us whether it was really true that during Obama’s days in Los Angeles "there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air." We’ll start with some background on smog. The smog predominant in Los Angeles -- formally known as "photochemical smog" -- is created when light reacts with motor vehicle and industrial emissions to form ground-level ozone. This ozone can make it difficult to breathe, causing asthma attacks and lung inflammation, as well as making eyes itchy and watery. In the United States, at least, Los Angeles has been ground zero for smog for decades, due to its heavy automobile usage, its industrial base and the presence of mountains and valleys, which prevent polluted air from floating elsewhere. Los Angeles smog emerged in the 1940s and worsened from the 1950s to the 1970s. It got so bad in October 1954 that the city virtually shut down for the entire month (and gas masks were common, as the photograph below illustrates). Smog became so closely identified with Los Angeles that "smog in a can" became a popular gag gift. Today, Los Angeles still has smog -- in April 2013, the American Lung Association ranked L.A. first in the nation for ozone pollution, as well as fourth for particulate pollution such as dust and soot. But concerted environmental efforts have reduced the extent of the problem significantly. In rising order of seriousness, smog alerts for southern California start with health advisories and move upwards to stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3. The last stage 3 smog alert came in 1974 -- so long ago that Ronald Reagan was still governor. The last stage 2 alert came in 1988, and there has been only one stage 1 alert since 1998 (it came in 2003). "Peak ozone levels in southern California today are roughly one-third of what they were in the late 1970s, due to aggressive and innovative air pollution controls here," said Sam Atwood, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the air-pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange County and portions of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. So what would Obama have experienced when he was a student at Occidental, the college he attended before transferring to Columbia University for his junior and senior year? We can approximate the impact based on statistical and anecdotal evidence. Occidental, located in the Eagle Rock neighborhood northeast of downtown L.A., would have been subject to many of the smog risks typical of the region from 1979 to 1981. According to South Coast Air Quality Management District data, a health advisory -- a comparatively low-level alert -- was issued somewhere in the agency’s region of jurisdiction 169 times in 1979, 152 times in 1980 and 159 times in 1981. The stage 1 threshold was met 120, 101, and 99 times during those three years. Even allowing that Occidental itself may have experienced just a fraction of these episodes, the university still would have faced a significant number. So what did these advisories mean in a practical sense? For a health advisory, the lowest of these levels, all children are supposed to "discontinue prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise lasting longer than one hour," and "susceptible persons, such as those with heart or lung disease" should "avoid outdoor activity," including "calisthenics, basketball, running, soccer, football, tennis, swimming laps, and water polo." For the more severe stage 1 episodes, all children are supposed to "discontinue all vigorous outdoor activities regardless of duration," including "physical education classes, sports practices, and athletic competitions." Finally, for stage 2 or stage 3, all children are supposed to "discontinue all outdoor activities." This suggests that Obama’s claim is slightly exaggerated. He said that "there were days where folks couldn't go outside," but nothing in the rules addressed what healthy adults could do, including healthy college-age kids. Rather, the rules addressed adults with compromised health as well as children. Still, the reality of smog alerts was not pretty, and by all accounts, staying inside, if feasible, was certainly preferable. The White House pointed us to a Newsweek article from Sept. 24, 1979, when Obama was just settling in at Occidental, that documents what it called the worst L.A. smog in 24 years. "Tennis courts stood empty," the article said. "Golf courses lay nearly deserted. Schools canceled recess, and the usual parade of joggers around Pasadena's Rose Bowl dwindled to just a handful." We found other first-hand testimony. Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College in the Los Angeles suburb of Claremont, recalls enduring smog alerts when he was a student at neighboring Pitzer College in the mid 1970s. "There were way too many days when you could not see the mountain that today frames my office window," he said. "It was possible to not know it was there for months at a time." And William Kelly, the co-author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles, recalls attending Occidental a few years before Obama. "When I got there in 1973, I played a vigorous game of basketball in an un-air-conditioned gym," Kelly said. "I don't remember the end of the game, just waking up in the early evening with a pounding headache and watering eyes and wheezing in my dorm room. Turns out there was a stage 2 smog alert going on that afternoon, and I didn't have a clue." Our ruling Obama said that as a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981, "there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air." The idea that "folks couldn’t go outside" is an oversimplification. The advisories -- and they were only advisories -- were aimed at children and people who had existing health concerns. But Obama is right that smog was a severe problem at the time in the Los Angeles region. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-08291	"Congressman Nye voted against a bill which would have defunded the $5-10 billion" the IRS needed to implement health care legislation.	false	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/01/scott-rigell/scott-nigell-says-glenn-nye-voted-against-bill-wou/	The fact that Rep. Glenn Nye voted against President Obama’s health care overhaul isn’t enough for Virginia Beach businessman Scott Rigell, Nye’s Republican challenger for Virginia’s 2nd District seat. In a release on Rigell’s website critiquing Nye’s performance following a debate, Rigell calls into question one of the Democratic Congressman’s votes related to health care. The release says that "on June 24, 2010, Congressman Nye voted against a bill which would have defunded the $5-10 billion required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to implement and enforce the health care legislation, including thousands of new IRS agents and employees." The legislation requires all Americans to carry health insurance. IRS agents will enforce that mandate. We were intrigued by Rigell’s claim and took a a closer look. Asked to support the statement, Rigell’s camp pointed to a procedural vote on a rule held during consideration of HR 5175, the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act. What does the Disclose Act have to do with Health Care? Not much. But among the political maneuvers that day was a last-ditch effort by Republicans to create legislation that would have blocked funding for the IRS to expand its staff to oversee the health care legislation. The vote Rigell cites arose from a request by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, that House members defeat a motion to consider The Disclose Act. That would have given Republicans a chance to introduce H.R. 5570, a bill that would have blocked IRS funding to enforce the health care law. What Nye and all but eight fellow Democrats actually voted forwas to proceed with the scheduled agenda rather than allowing Republicans to hijack the floor during a rules vote. "By voting against it, the Democrats would essentially lose control of the floor to the Republicans to vote on what they want. It’s a gotcha sort of vote," explained Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. Even if the Democrats had lost the floor, Ellis noted, the was no guarantee the minority Republicans could muster enough votes to introduce and pass legislation that would have eliminated money for the IRS. "That’s a real stretch," said Ellis. "This is incredibly convoluted and who knows what the vote would’ve been if the Republicans had taken control. They totally would have been like the dog who caught the car." The $5 billion-$10 billion figure came from a Dec. 19, 2009 Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill, which became the basis for the bill that was passed by both chambers and signed into law. The analysis said the IRS "would probably" incur those total costs over 10 years. So, let’s take a look back at the specifics. Rigell says that Nye voted against a bill that would blocked funding for the expansion of the IRS to implement and enforce health care legislation. First, is it correct to say that Nye voted "against a bill"? No. To start with, the issue in question was a procedural vote on a motion to proceed on legislation unrelated to health care, not a vote against a bill. That said, there’s a tiny fraction of truth in the suggestion that Nye’s vote closed the the door on a bill that might have eliminated funding for a portion of health care reform. But, Nye didn’t vote "against" anything. He voted for House consideration to proceed on the Disclose Act. It is far-fetched to make such a sweeping conclusion based on a procedural vote. For that reason, we find the claim to be False.	None	Scott Rigell	None	None	None	2010-11-01T18:49:18	2010-09-08	['None']

pomt-02733	"Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. ... And there are more uninsured children in Texas than in any other state."	true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/19/kathleen-sebelius/texas-has-highest-uninsured-rate-and-most-uninsure/	As a congressional committee prepared for a North Texas hearing about Obamacare "navigators," U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius rose to their defense. Texas particularly needs them to educate and enroll others in the online health insurance marketplaces created by the law, she said. "Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. ... And there are more uninsured children in Texas than in any other state," Sebelius wrote in a Dec. 15, 2013, opinion column in the Dallas Morning News. In the piece, which later appeared in the Dec. 18, 2013, Austin American-Statesman, Sebelius said Texas could have helped many immediately by accepting the Affordable Care Act’s offer of federal dollars to help pay for expanding Medicaid. We recently rated as True a claim from President Barack Obama that a million Texans could get insurance right away if the state agreed to the expansion. Critics have noted how few Texans have health insurance for decades, though in March 2013, PolitiFact Texas rated as False a claim by state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, that Texas had the most uninsured residents of any state at 6 million. In fact, California had about 1 million more uninsured residents in 2011. Then again, California’s population then exceeded Texas’ by some 12 million. Rate of uninsured residents When you look at the percentage of uninsured residents instead of the raw numbers, Texas has the highest, as Sebelius said. Drawing on U.S. Census Bureau research, the Kaiser Family Foundation said 24 percent of Texas residents in 2012 had no health insurance, followed by Nevada (23 percent) and Florida (21 percent.) Nationwide, the uninsured rate was 15 percent. A September 2013 analysis by the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education, said Texas in 2012 had the highest rate of nonelderly uninsured: 26.9 percent. Uninsured children Census spokesman Robert Bernstein guided us by phone through 2012 American Community Survey data on uninsured children, helping us produce a table that showed Nevada ranked first in percentage uninsured, followed by a grouping of states with statistically similar percentages: Alaska, Arizona, Texas and Montana. So in 2012, Texas was tied for second among states with the highest share of uninsured children. But Sebelius cited the raw number of uninsured children, not rate. As above, in raw numbers one might expect the most-populous states to have high totals. But despite having fewer residents than California, Texas had more uninsured children in 2012. Spokeswoman Emma Sandoe at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, part of the federal Health and Human Services Department, guided us to the 2012 Census estimates of uninsured children by state. Texas ranked first, with 1.1 million uninsured children, followed by California with 891,000; Florida with 528,000; and Georgia with 321,000. Our ruling Sebelius said, "Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. ... And there are more uninsured children in Texas than in any other state." Texas has the highest rate of uninsured residents overall, about a quarter of its population, and has the most uninsured children (though not the highest rate of uninsured children). We rate the secretary’s statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-07847	Oregon families pay an extra $1,400 a year on higher insurance premiums to cover those who do not have insurance.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/12/peter-defazio/peter-defazio-says-oregonians-pay-extra-cover-unin/	Don’t look now, but the health care debate, in all its high-decibel, combustible glory is revving up again. The House has already approved a bill calling for the 2010 law to be repealed. The Senate considered a similar proposal but Democrats defeated it. And now, Rep. Peter DeFazio is stepping into the battle with legislation that would dismantle a central element of the law -- the so-called "individual mandate" that requires every American to carry health insurance. DeFazio says doing away with the requirement would end legal challenges questioning its constitutionality and save people money. "Congress can quickly resolve the issues of constitutionality and the limits of the federal government by reforming the individual mandate with an opt-out clause that allows for full personal responsibility. I believe buying insurance should be a choice, not a matter of federal coercion," DeFazio writes in a Feb. 1, "Dear Colleague" letter. Money, though, is a central element of his pitch. "Oregon families pay an extra $1,400 a year ... on higher insurance premiums to cover those who do not have insurance," DeFazio wrote in his letter. The clear inference is that if a person voluntarily decides to live without health insurance, the rest of us are off the hook if something bad happens. "If they waive their right to the federal health care backstop, then they alone are burdened with their future health care costs," DeFazio writes. It’s a clever device that accentuates the emotional argument while conveniently side-stepping some important nuances. First is the question of cost. DeFazio’s claim that the average Oregonian with insurance absorbs a $1,400 surcharge to cover those without insurance is correct. The practice is called cost shifting and it means that those who have insurance pay higher rates than necessary to cover the cost of those who do not. DeFazio’s letter suggests, but does not explicitly say, that people’s health insurance premiums would cost less if the mandate is removed. The reason, he says in the letter, is that anyone who makes the choice not to carry insurance would have to sign an affidavit and agree to pay all medical costs. Multiple studies over the years have analyzed the practice. Most agree that nationally, the cost of health insurance for a family is $1,100 higher as a result of the uninsured. (Politicians from both sides have used the figure, including President Barack Obama.) One of the first studies came in 2005 from the interest group, FamiliesUSA, which calculated the cost to a family would be $992. Ironically, the group cited that surcharge as a reason for requiring everybody to have insurance since that would spread the cost -- and the coverage -- over a larger population. As the health care debate intensified, the 2005 work was updated. In 2008, the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress calculated that the "hidden tax" jumped, on average, to $1,000. It also provided state-by-state estimates, with the surcharge in Oregon calculated to be $1,400. "This ‘hidden tax’ on health insurance arises from a failure to continuously cover all Americans and accounts for roughly 8 percent of the average health insurance premium. This cost-shift amounts to $1,100 per average family premium in 2009 and $410 per average individual premium," the center said in a 2009 report. So it’s well established and mostly beyond debate that premiums for those with health insurance are higher to absorb some of the cost for those who don’t have it. But things break down for those like DeFazio, who try to draw a straight-line cause and effect. "We do not necessarily assume that the private revenues used to subsidize care to the uninsured inevitably cause higher private payments and insurance premiums," the Kaiser Family Foundation study found. "In particular, the Families USA approach omits the possibility that providers who treat substantial numbers of uninsured people have lower profits. In fact, we are highly skeptical that the high and growing cost of private insurance is strongly related, if at all, to the amount of uncompensated care delivered by private providers or to the growing number of uninsured people," Kaiser analysts concluded. DeFazio’s claim about the "hidden tax" is based in fact but he fails to provide sufficient nuance to a complex and emotionally wrought question. For that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-11856	"When I saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/03/michael-kearns/kearns-constant-critic-sheldon-silver-while-assemb/	Assemblymember Michael P. Kearns, a Democrat who’s running on the Republican line for Erie County clerk, says he has a history of standing up to leadership in government. Kearns claims in a television ad that he wasn’t shy about calling out Sheldon Silver, who served as State Assembly speaker for two decades before his conviction on federal corruption charges in 2015. "When I saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign," Kearns says in the ad. Some of his colleagues in the Assembly found it difficult to oppose Silver, even after his arrest. Kearns says he didn’t fall into that camp. Is that true? Sexual harassment in the State Assembly Kearns first called for Silver to resign in 2013. It was Kearns’ first full year in the Assembly. Kearns chose to conference with the Democratic majority in the Assembly when he first took office in 2012. That lasted about a year. Then news broke that Silver had helped cover up reports of sexual harassment in the State Assembly. A state ethics report accused former Assemblyman Vito Lopez of harassing at least eight women during his time in the chamber. The report accused Silver and his staff of failing to properly investigate the sexual harassment claims against Lopez. Silver also approved a confidential settlement of more than $100,000 for two women who accused Lopez of harassment. When the ethics report was released, Kearns called for Silver to resign. He also left the Democratic conference in the Assembly. "I am a father with a teenage daughter," Kearns wrote in The Buffalo News. "I must ask, ‘Would I trust my daughter’s welfare under Sheldon Silver’s leadership or supervision?’ The record is clear beyond a reasonable doubt: The answer is ‘no.’ " Silver’s corruption charges Kearns again called for Silver to resign in 2015. Silver was arrested on federal corruption charges in January 2015. Federal prosecutors accused Silver of using his position as speaker to accept millions of dollars worth of bribes and kickbacks. Kearns, who never re-joined the Democratic conference, called for Silver’s resignation the morning he was arrested. "Secret settlements, sex scandals and now criminal allegations. All of the above should disqualify Silver from keeping leadership position," Kearns said in a tweet minutes after Silver’s arrest. At first, most Democratic Assembly members rallied behind Silver, their leader of two decades. Silver eventually stepped down after calls for his ouster mounted. Kearns did not re-join the Democratic conference until Silver was convicted later that year. His conviction has since been overturned, but prosecutors are expected to bring a new case against the long-time assemblymember. Our ruling Kearns said when he "saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign." Kearns first called on Silver to resign in 2013. He even left the Democratic conference because he did not support Silver as speaker. His position never changed. We rate his claim as True.

pomt-08827	Says Democrat Hank Gilbert "has a criminal conviction for theft, has multiple years of unpaid taxes, has multiple tax liens and fines, unsafe driving convictions (and) has recently been accused of taking a bribe and is on record lying to the press this year about his criminal record."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/13/todd-staples/todd-staples-consultant-says-democrat-hank-gilbert/	On behalf of Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, a campaign consultant recently ripped Staples’ Democratic challenger, Hank Gilbert. Consultant Bryan Eppstein’s July 15 e-mail to PolitiFact Texas says: "The (D)emocrat candidate for Texas commissioner of agriculture has a criminal conviction for theft, has multiple years of unpaid taxes, has multiple tax liens and fines, unsafe driving convictions, has recently been accused of taking a bribe and is on record lying to the press this year about his criminal record." Bombshells? Hardly. Several news articles have been written on Gilbert’s legal history, and the Staples campaign has aired them on its "Guilty Guilty Gilbert" website. Generally, the campaigns have sniped so much that the Houston Chronicle has called the race a "snarling, gouging, roll-in-the-dirt rhetorical grudge match," a reference to their 2006 faceoff when Staples beat Gilbert to win his office. Novel or not, the Staples campaign (through a surrogate) lobs six (count ‘em) charges. Do they stick? Let’s start with the criminal conviction. In January 2001, according to a Smith County court document, Gilbert, who lives near the East Texas burg of Whitehouse, pleaded guilty to a Class C misdemeanor theft charge, paying a $100 fine plus court costs. Earlier this year, the American-Statesman quoted as Gilbert saying the arrest originated in miscommunication between accountants for a cleaning service he and his wife own. That miscommunication, Gilbert said, led to three months’ worth of payroll taxes going unpaid. The snafu, Gilbert said, also resulted in a $100 check that he thinks was written to Lowe’s, the home improvement store, initially going unpaid. The check touched off the theft charge, according to Gilbert. Vince Leibowitz, Gilbert’s campaign manager, objected to calling the misdemeanor conviction "theft," saying it was "theft by check." He shared a copy of what he said was Gilbert’s plea agreement; it says he was charged with "theft by check," a Class B misdemeanor. A judgment signed by a county court-at-law judge says Gilbert pleaded guilty to the "lesser included offense of Theft C." We contacted the Smith County district attorney’s office where Leslie McLean, an assistant district attorney, confirmed that Gilbert was originally charged with Class B "theft by check." On a related front, McLean said Gilbert’s case stemmed from a $149.39 check paid to a local resident — information a bit different from what Gilbert said earlier this year. As to unpaid taxes, the Statesman quoted Gilbert as saying he and his wife had 18 months remaining on an IRS repayment plan. According to the newspaper’s report, Gilbert had to pay back not only missed tax payments, but also two years’ worth of penalties and interest to cover for the period he did not know their business had missed his payments. "Small businesses go through this kind of thing every day," Gilbert told the Statesman. "Unfortunately a lot of them choose the easy way out and stiff whoever they owe and never pay them. That’s not the kind of people we are." Smith County records posted by Staples’ campaign indicate that Gilbert faced tax liens for unpaid taxes in 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2002. All told, the records indicate, he accumulated $77,126 in taxes and penalties. Leibowitz told us Gilbert is repaying everything. And Gilbert’s driving record? A Smith County document posted by Staples’ campaign indicates Gilbert got a ticket for driving with an expired driver’s license in April 2008 for which he paid a $134.50 fine plus court costs in January 2010. That month, his campaign told the Dallas Morning News that Gilbert dealt with the ticket after aides noticed he was driving with the expired license. The newspaper said he’d gotten the ticket for the expired license when he got a speeding ticket in 2008. Another Smith County document says Gilbert was ticketed in March 2005 for driving without a seat belt, later paying a $53 fine plus court costs. "I never wear one," Gilbert was quoted in the Morning News this January. "I just plug them in to keep them from dinging." Linda Culp, chief clerk of the county’s Precinct 3 Justice of the Peace court, checked county records and found that in addition to what the Staples campaign highlighted, Gilbert paid fines for tickets he got in 1997-98 for speeding, not wearing a seat belt and not having auto insurance. In Gilbert’s defense, Leibowitz said: "When you look at driving without a seat belt, that is not necessarily unsafe to other passengers on the road. That is unsafe to you." The campaign manager said Gilbert does use his seat belt, contrary to what the candidate told the Dallas newspaper. Let’s pull over and assess the first four charges in Eppstein’s statement. Criminal conviction for theft? Actually, Gilbert was charged with the Class B misdemeanor of "theft by check" and pleaded guilty to a lesser, Class C charge, according to the court documents provided by his campaign. Multiple years of unpaid taxes? Yes (though Gilbert’s said he’s paying them back). Multiple tax liens and fines? Yes, yet note the repayment declaration. Unsafe driving convictions? Gilbert acknowledges tickets he’s paid, including for speeding and not wearing his seat belt. Smith County says he previously paid for tickets on other violations. Next, let’s tackle the rest of Eppstein’s sally — that Gilbert has recently been accused of taking a bribe and is on record lying to the press about his criminal record. Kinky Friedman, Gilbert’s opponent for the Democratic nomination for agriculture commissioner, raised his eyebrows in January at the revelation in campaign contribution and expenditure reports that Gilbert fielded $150,000 in donations from Farouk Shami, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, in late 2009 after Gilbert left the governor’s race to run for ag commissioner. Friedman called the donations a bribe. Gilbert’s campaign replied there was no payoff. Shami said likewise. And that’s where everyone left it, far as we can tell. Eppstein’s last punch — that Gilbert is on record lying to the press this year about his criminal record — refers to Gilbert’s responses on a questionnaire from the Dallas Morning News. Staples’ website says the question was: "Have you ever been arrested?" Gilbert answered that he was arrested for an "unpaid traffic ticket," according to an excerpt from the questionnaire posted by Staples’ campaign. Eppstein, objecting, said Gilbert omitted his 2001 conviction. However, Leibowitz told us, the Democrat was never arrested on that charge, a point confirmed by Laurita Vodak, court coordinator for Smith County Court-at-Law No. 3. How do the last two claims by Eppstein rate? Well, Gilbert was accused of taking a bribe, but that charge came from a political opponent, hardly an impartial force. Staples’ last claim — that Gilbert lied by not including his theft conviction in answering the question about arrests — is flawed. Gilbert wasn’t arrested on the charge, though he certainly faced justice and could have mentioned the conviction on the questionnaire. All in all, we rate the Staples campaign’s statement Half True. Footnote: We’d be happy not to sort multi-part charges again. That OK with everyone?	None	Todd Staples	None	None	None	2010-08-13T06:00:00	2010-07-15	['None']
pomt-09458	Reconciliation was used "for tax cuts for the rich twice under Bush."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/04/alan-grayson/bush-tax-cuts-were-passed-reconciliations-50-votes/	Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., has a reputation for using political rhetoric that pushes the envelope. On March 3, 2010, he appeared on CNN's Larry King Live along with Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., who's also known for her outspokenness from the opposite ideological perspective. Bachmann started the exchange by saying the Senate should not finalize health care reform by using reconciliation, a parliamentary maneuver that requires only 50 votes, instead of the 60 needed to stop filibusters. Bachmann said the Senate would have to "break their own rules in order to pass the bill." Grayson disagreed, naturally. "My esteemed colleague from Minnesota is entirely wrong," Grayson replied. "There's nothing in Senate rules that prevents reconciliation. It's been used 22 times overall and 14 times by Republicans. If it's good enough for tax cuts for the rich twice under Bush, it's good enough to provide health care for all Americans." We'll have to wait for events to play out before we learn if health care reform meets the parliamentary rules for reconciliation. The final call on the matter will likely depend on how the legislation is written and determinations made by the Senate parliamentarian and the Senate president, a role fulfilled by the vice president. We know from our previous reporting that Grayson is also correct that reconciliation was used 22 times overall and 14 times by Republicans. Here, we wanted to check Grayson's statement that reconciliation was used "for tax cuts for the rich twice under Bush." We checked with Grayson's staff, and they said he was referring to the large tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. We checked the votes, and both were passed by reconciliation. The 2001 tax cuts passed 58-33. All the Republican senators (with the exception of John McCain, R-Ariz.) were joined by 12 Democrats to pass the measure. But the tax cuts were across-the-board rate reductions for all tax filers, a detail that Grayson omitted when describing them as being "for the rich." It's true that the wealthy tend to pay the most taxes and thus saw the biggest drops to their tax bills. But many other taxpayers saw declines in their tax bills as well. Our previous reporting indicates that the tax cuts for the middle class during the Bush years were more costly than the tax cuts for the highest incomes, because the middle class outnumbers the very wealthy. The 2003 tax cuts were also passed by reconciliation. These were more controversial, because at this point the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had started, and later the same year Congress passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The vote in the Senate was 51-50, with vice president Dick Cheney breaking the tie. (The vice president is technically the president of the Senate and can break ties.) In this vote, only two Democrats joined the Republicans. The 2003 tax cuts included a number of measures, but the most significant reductions were taxes on dividends and capital gains taxes. Typically, these taxes are on investment income, and those cuts tend to give a bigger break to taxpayers with higher incomes. Grayson is taking a bit of a liberty by describing the measures as "tax cuts for the rich," especially the 2001 cuts, when tax rates were rolled back across income categories. Still, the wealthy did receive significant benefits from the tax cuts since they pay the most taxes, and that was particularly true of the 2003 package. Grayson is correct that the tax cuts were both passed by reconciliation. The 2003 vote, in fact, passed by the narrowest of margins. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-04269	"Mitt Romney made over a hundred million dollars by shutting down (a Marion, Ind. paper) plant."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/nov/05/priorities-usa-action/ad-claims-mitt-romney-made-over-hundred-million-do/	A dramatic TV ad featuring an employee of a plant shuttered by Bain Capital is getting new life in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Virginia and Florida. It claims Mitt Romney "made over a hundred million dollars" by shutting down a paper products factory in Marion, Ind. Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC, created the TV ad, which has also been viewed more than 2.7 million times on YouTube since its debut in June. The ad, designed to portray Romney as an enemy of the middle class, tells the story of employees who built a stage — only to watch company officials announce they had all lost their jobs. "Turns out that when we built that stage, it was like building my own coffin. And it just made me sick," says Mike Earnest, one of the workers. Near the end of his story, Earnest claims: "Mitt Romney made over a hundred million dollars by shutting down our plant, and devastated our lives." It’s a heart-wrenching story. We wondered: Is it true that Romney "made over a hundred million dollars" by shutting down the plant? As it turns out, there are several things wrong with this claim. Bain, Ampad and SCM Office Supplies Romney was CEO of a private equity firm, Bain Capital. A Bain company called Ampad did buy the Marion paper plant in 1994, while he was on leave running for Senate, and shut it down in 1995. At the time, Ampad was profitable. But there’s disagreement about the health of the Marion plant, known as SCM Office Supplies. Workers argued it was fine before Ampad came along, and the super PAC and the Romney camp marshal various documents to argue it made a profit, and that it didn’t. Either way, it was quickly in trouble when workers, who had to reapply for their jobs after the Ampad purchase, decided to strike rather than accept lower-paid positions. But what is clear is that no one made "made over a hundred million dollars" from shutting down a paper plant. Bain and its investors made over a hundred million dollars from their entire investment in Ampad, which they purchased in 1992, before the company was liquidated in 2001. (They sold off most of their investment and gave up control of the company with a public offering in 1996, according to Bain spokeswoman Charlyn Lusk.) A chart from the Boston Globe shows Bain and its investors made their money primarily through two main events: as part of Ampad’s borrowing to buy an envelope and stationery maker in 1995, and by selling Ampad stock in 1996. Under Bain, Ampad grew to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, far beyond the scale of the single Marion plant. We contacted Priorities USA Action for support for its ad’s claim. Spokesman Brennan Bilberry pointed us to evidence that Romney was directly involved with the decision to shut down the Marion plant, and to prospectuses and news articles showing Bain earned a more than 2,000 percent return in its Ampad investment — at least $102 million. He argued that reducing costs from the Marion plant helped drive Ampad’s profit. Still, the evidence he provided shows that was the profit for a much larger investment involving multiple acquisitions over years. Our ruling A former plant employee in an ad from Priorities USA Action says, "Mitt Romney made over a hundred million dollars by shutting down our plant." The Marion plant’s purchase and closure was part of a larger investment in paper products manufacturing that earned Bain and its investors over $100 million. It’s a sad tale for Marion workers: Their plant was sold. They lost their jobs, had to reapply to make less, and went on strike. Ultimately Bain closed the plant. But shutting down the plant didn’t make Romney $100 million. That was the profit made by Bain and its investors, only some of which would have been earned by Romney. And it was earned for the entire Ampad investment — not as a result of closing a single manufacturing site. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-01954	"One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/22/texas-future/texas-might-grow-15-million-people-25-years-it-won/	A May 2014 video ad opens with the narrator saying: "One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years. And since people can’t bring their roads with them, that means we’ll have a lot of extra cars without additional driving space." If only to mull the narrator’s drawl, we recommend you watch the ad from Texas Future, an entity that has surfaced in advance of November 2014 balloting on a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing lawmakers to tap the state’s rainy day fund for road projects. We wondered about the 1,000-a-day statement and the declared link to 15 million more residents within a quarter century. 1,000 additional Texans a day We’re ready to deem "1,000 people a day move to Texas" a golden oldie of flawed factoids, because it doesn’t acknowledge people routinely quit the state, too. The state demographer, Lloyd Potter, who we asked about the group’s claim, counseled by phone that more than 1,000 people a day may have moved to Texas from other states and countries from July 2012 through June 2013, but plenty of people also left, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Potter noted by email that net migration over the 12 months -- people moving in less people moving out -- totaled 177,715. "Dividing that by 365, we estimate that there were on average 487 net migrants to Texas each day," Potter emailed. That’s not as high (or catchy) as what Texas Future said. But there’s a way to get to a factually stout rendition of the 1,000 factoid. Overall, Potter and Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman, previously cited the bureau’s Texas estimates to say the state gained an average of 1,061 residents a day over the 12 months -- taking into account net migration as well as births here outpacing deaths. We gathered a slightly longer view of the 1,000-a-day figure from Steve Murdock, a Rice University sociologist and former state demographer and past director of the census bureau. Murdock said by email that per bureau population estimates covering April 2010 through June 2013, Texas added nearly 1,100 people a day with more than half the increase due to births outnumbering deaths. Net migration into Texas from abroad and from other states, he said, accounted for a gain of 515 people a day; births exceeding deaths was responsible for 577 more people a day. Fifteen million additional Texans in 25 years Enough about the first part of this claim; do all the expected additional residents mean there will be 15 million additional residents 25 years from now, as the group says? After our first-pass interviews with Potter and Murdock, a Texas Future spokesman, David Polyansky, said by email the projection of 15 million additional Texans has appeared in state reports including a March 2011 report on transportation by an advisory panel to the Texas Department of Transportation. It refers to 15 million Texans "projected to arrive over the next 25 years." We nudged Potter about that. He confirmed such a projection, but cautioned it’s not expected to occur simply due to 1,000 new residents a day. Potter said the state’s projections based on population growth from 2000 to 2010 indicate a potential addition of 15 million residents in about 25 years by assuming that as more people settle in, an escalating number of babies will be born. "Thus the growth in our population projections is more geometric (or compounding) in nature," Potter wrote. In contrast, Potter said, simply adding 1,000 residents a day to the population (as the group’s statement says) reflects "arithmetic growth, which is substantially slower," meaning it would take nearly 39 years to gain 15 million additional residents by this factor alone, he said. Polyansky later agreed the average of 1,000 new Texans a day combines natural population growth as well as in-migration. The ad, he said, "should be phrased differently," though it remains the case more people potentially puts more pressure on the highways. Our ruling Texas Future said: "One thousand people a day are moving to Texas, which means there will be 15 million more people over the next 25 years." More than 1,000 people a day move to Texas, but at the same time hundreds leave. Still, the population grows by more than 1,000 a day, though that's mostly due to births outpacing deaths rather than Californians and other out-of-staters parking their Teslas. Another wrinkle: The state demographer agrees the population could grow by 15 million within about 25 years. But contrary to the group’s message, reasons for the potential growth extend beyond the number of people that could flock here from elsewhere. On balance, we rate this claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:40 p.m., June 23, 2014: We revised our quotation of Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, to make it clear what he told us about the effects of net migration and there being more births than deaths in the state. This didn't affect our rating of the claim.	None	Texas Future	None	None	None	2014-06-22T06:00:00	2014-05-08	['Texas']
pomt-02201	"In 2005, Dan Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/24/texas-right-life/texas-lawmakers-including-dan-branch-tightened-lim/	Have Republican voters advanced a candidate for attorney general who tried to make abortion more accessible? Texas Right to Life said in a March 21, 2014, email blast about state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, "In 2005, Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas!" The blast said the change "would have endangered disabled, unborn babies." Well, it was an amendment to an amended amendment, and it would have provided an exception to an abortion restriction that didn’t yet exist. Does that mean Branch "tried to expand" late-term abortions? Branch faces state Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the GOP nomination in the race to replace Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. Backup: An amendment to an amendment By email, Texas Right to Life legislative director John Seago pointed us to an amendment Branch offered May 16, 2005, as the House was considering Senate Bill 419 to maintain the state medical regulatory agencies. From the front of the House chamber, Republican Rep. Will Hartnett of Dallas put forward an amendment to the state’s Occupations Code prohibiting third-trimester abortions "when the abortion is not necessary to prevent the death of the woman." Hartnett’s move--which won legislative approval and the backing of Republicans including Branch--amounted to a tightening of the existing state law, which barred third-trimester abortions unless the physician performing the abortion found the action "necessary to prevent the death or a substantial risk of serious impairment to the physical or mental health of the woman; or the fetus has a severe and irreversible abnormality, identified by reliable diagnostic procedures." (That law was left in place, however, though the new restrictions superseded the old language due to a long-time legal provision stating that when laws are irreconciliable with one another, the law of more recent enactment prevails.) During House consideration of his proposal, Hartnett amended it to bar third-trimester abortions if "the viable unborn child does not have a severe, irreversible brain impairment." Branch then proposed adding "or vital organ" after "brain:" Recapping: Hartnett’s amended amendment would allow late abortions if a "viable unborn child" had irreversible brain damage. Branch’s amendment, which Hartnett opposed, would have added another exception, allowing third-trimester abortions if the viable unborn child had irreversible damage to vital organs. Branch offers rationale not mentioned in '05 debate We sought to interview Branch about why he offered his amendment. Branch campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us via email that Branch "was concerned that, by focusing arbitrarily on the brain, to the exclusion of the heart or lungs, the Legislature might give a court an excuse to question the rational basis of the law." Branch didn’t explicitly mention potential court concerns in the House floor debate, according to the House’s archived online video (debate on Branch’s amendment starts at the 2:08:11 mark). But he repeatedly said it was rational to roll in irreversible vital organ damage if Hartnett’s amendment already specified irreversible brain damage as an exception. Branch said, "What this is merely attempting to do is to be intellectually honest with the fact that there are other vital organs besides the brain in a third-trimester fetus. That’s all I’m trying to do." Branch, saying he was "strongly opposed as a general matter to third-trimester abortions," told the House, "If you’re going to have this exception for severe, irreversible brain damage, then my point is, as a son of a neurosurgeon, as a brother of a neurosurgeon, as someone who’s lived through this with multiple children and multiple miscarriages, the term ‘or vital organ’ merely says that the heart -- it acknowledges that the heart or the lack of lungs or the kidney or the liver are all also vital organs in addition to the brain." Branch in debate: 'Pro-life position' After about 40 minutes of debate on his proposal, Branch said, "I hope you understand I’m coming from this in a pro-life position; I’m really just trying to be careful and precise and intellectually honest. If we’re going to make this exception for the brain, then we ought to include absolutely essential organs." Hartnett, moving to table Branch’s proposal, told House members that "vital organ" was too broad: "I just think ... we’re getting into the posture of trying to water it down by drip, drip, erosion," he said. "You can live without a kidney is my understanding, you can live without a lung, you can live without just about anything except your brain, and that’s why we’re drawing the line at the brain." The House tabled Branch’s amendment before voting to adopt the Hartnett amendment and another that Hartnett offered requiring girls under age 18 to have a parent's permission before getting an abortion. In the end, both Hartnett measures were regarded as tightening abortion restrictions. News stories from May 17, 2005, described the amendments as abortion limits, including a Fort Worth Star-Telegram story that quoted Hartnett as saying, "It's important for our (abortion laws) to be drawn tighter, rather than broader, to protect the children and to give these children an opportunity to be born." So Hartnett’s measure tightened abortion limits; Branch’s amendment would have added a second exception to one of them. Groups diverge Returning to the present day: In the Texas Right to Life email, Texas Eagle Forum leader Cathie Adams and state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, author of abortion restrictions that the Republican-led 2013 Legislature approved, are quoted as saying Branch's amendment would have expanded access to abortion. On the other hand, Joe Pojman, executive director of Austin-based anti-abortion group Texas Alliance for Life (which endorsed Branch on April 11, 2014), told us by email that his organization regards it as "as highly misleading and disingenuous" to say Branch tried to expand late-term abortions. Pojman said neither Hartnett’s fetal brain-damage exception nor Branch’s vital-organ exception would have expanded third-trimester abortions because the existing restrictions -- which lawmakers left in place -- didn’t significantly limit late abortions. "Third-trimester abortions were effectively legal in Texas in 2005" because of the mother’s-mental-health clause, he said. Our ruling Texas Right to Life said, "In 2005, Dan Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas." TThis statement would hold up if Branch's amendment loosened established limits. To the contrary, lawmakers including Branch embraced specific restrictions superseding a broad limit stating that any fetus with a severe, irreversible abnormality could be aborted in the third trimester. If Branch's proposal had been adopted, such abortions could have taken place if a fetus had a severe irreversible impairment to the brain or--Branch’s wrinkle--another vital organ. The bottom line is Branch’s proposal would have restricted such abortions more than they'd been limited, which makes this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-11070	"You can’t (end the separation of families at the border) through an executive order."	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/21/donald-trump/trump-changes-course-stops-family-separation-borde/	Since early June, President Donald Trump has insisted that his hands were tied and families who wanted to enter America without permission had to be separated. The adults went to one place to await criminal charges, while their children were sent to another facility. As the number of children being held rose above 2,000, Trump continued to blame the Democrats for blocking a solution. "I hate the children being taken away," Trump told reporters June 15. "The Democrats have to change their law. That’s their law." Pressed on the option to use executive action, Trump said "you can’t do it through an executive order." Flash forward. Sitting in the Oval Office June 20, Trump signed an executive order that directed the Homeland Security Department to "maintain custody of alien families" while their cases move through the immigration system, "to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations." "It's about keeping families together, while at the same time being sure we have a very powerful very strong border and border security will be equal, if not greater than previously," Trump said. Trump’s order sounds at odds with his previous statements, so we wanted to examine Trump’s shift on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures an official’s consistency on an issue. Mounting pressure for change While families attempting to enter the country had been separated in the past, immigration officials did so as an exception and not a rule. It was only in April when Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings that the numbers of separated families ballooned. Previously, first-time offenders, who often sought asylum, were put on a legal path that left them free to come back for a hearing. Under the new policy, government agents charged undocumented people with a crime and sent them directly to detention centers. Any children were sent to be cared for in separate facilities. According to the latest reports, the government was holding over 2,300 minors under the age of 12. The outcry against the practice grew steadily louder. Democrats railed against the zero-tolerance policy and visited the centers where the children were kept. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told Trump he could change the situation with the stroke of a pen. A dozen Republican senators called on Sessions to change policies to end the separations. Through it all, Trump and his allies were adamant: As much as they didn’t like taking children from their parents, they insisted it was inevitable. "It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation," Trump tweeted June 20. "If the Democrats would sit down instead of obstructing, we could have something done very quickly," he said at a June 18 White House event. "Good for the children, good for the country, good for the world. It could take place quickly." Attorney General Sessions cited the Bible as the foundation for enforcing a zero-tolerance policy. "I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes," Sessions said June 14 in Fort Wayne, Ind. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said, "It is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States. Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix it." But with two-thirds of the public saying they opposed breaking up families, and religious leaders including Pope Francis calling it morally unacceptable, Trump changed his mind. The June 20 order Trump’s executive order reversing the practice continued to argue that Congress’ inaction allowed the situation to happen. "It is unfortunate that Congress’s failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law," it says. Nonetheless, it goes on to announce a "temporary detention policy" for keeping apprehended families together through court proceedings — breaking from his administration’s prior choice of enforcement. The order calls on all government agencies, especially the Defense Department, to provide any facilities that might be suitable to house families. For the Pentagon, that could include building new housing. Trump also told the attorney general to ask for a federal district court to allow the detention of families under a 1997 agreement known as the Flores settlement. The Obama administration had tried something similar. "The Flores settlement will need to be revised to allow indefinite detention of children," said immigration law professor and dean of the UC Davis School of Law Kevin Johnson. "That seems unlikely. The court refused to allow the Obama administration to detain children for long periods in response to the influx of Central Americans in 2014." Trump’s order also directs the attorney general to "prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families." It was not clear how or if the policy would affect children already separated from their families. Trump promised "you will have lots of happy people," but the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the children’s care, said in a statement "it is still very early, and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter." The statement said it aims to reunify the children with their parents. Trump said the zero-tolerance policy remains in effect. Our ruling Trump said he couldn’t change the policy of separating children from their parents at the border. It was up to Democrats to change it. Then he signed an executive order to end the policy. The order is clearly at odds with Trump’s previous statements. We rate this a Full Flop. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-06-21T07:16:41	2018-06-15	['None']
pomt-08108	Says Jim Renacci ran against the Washington establishment in the election, but is now "hypocritically embracing it with big money, special interest fundraisers."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/13/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-congressional-campaign-committe-takes-l/	Winning his bid for Congress has put Wadsworth Republican Jim Renacci in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s crosshairs for the foreseeable future. On Dec. 7, the campaign arm of House of Representatives Democrats sent a "Republican Hypocrisy Alert" to reporters titled "Representative-elect Jim Renacci Tells Washington Special Interests He is ‘Open for Business.’" The news release cited news reports that listed Renacci among a group of newly elected Republican legislators who held post-election fundraisers in Washington, D.C., to pay off the debt from their campaigns. "Representative-elect Jim Renacci claimed to run against the Washington establishment, but less than a month after being elected Renacci is hypocritically embracing it with big money, special interest fundraisers," DCCC spokesperson Ryan Rudominer said in the release. On Dec. 8, Renacci spokesman James Slepian confirmed Renacci held a Dec. 7 lunch fundraiser to help retire his campaign debts. He said it was attended by about a dozen people, including political action committee representatives. Slepian called it "disingenuous" for the DCCC to attack Renacci for holding a fundraiser with PACs in light of the fact that the DCCC-backed incumbent that Renacci beat, Rep. John Boccieri, got most of his election money from PACs. During his term in Congress, Boccieri held numerous PAC fundraisers in Washington, according to a Sunlight Foundation database of fundraising invitations. "We are just raising some money the way every other elected official is trying to do," Slepian said. "There wasn’t an ‘open for business’ sign anywhere." Is Renacci being hypocritical for raising PAC money after his election? During his campaign for Congress, Renacci often criticized his Democratic rival for relying on political action committee money. It’s a standard charge that challengers throw at incumbents. An Oct. 15 news release from Renacci said that "John Boccieri has consistently relied on Washington special interests and union bosses to finance his campaign — with a majority of his contributions coming from political action committees." A review of Boccieri’s latest Federal Election Commission report shows the incumbent got about $1,047,000 from political action committees and $983,000 from individuals, which means he got roughly 52 percent of his money from PACs. A Center for Responsive Politics analysis of Boccieri’s PAC donations shows about a third of them came from organized labor, a third came from businesses and a third from "ideological or single issue" groups. But even as Renacci complained about Boccieri’s political action committee money, he took it himself. Federal Election Committee records show that Renacci’s campaign got about $317,000 from political action committees and $1.1 million in donations from individuals. Renacci, an independently wealthy businessman, also loaned about $750,000 of his own money to the campaign. That’s the debt he’s now trying to pay off. About 15 percent of Renacci’s money came from PACs, about half was from individual donors, and about a third came from his own pocket. Renacci accepted money from political action committees long before he won his election. Those that gave him $10,000 before November include committees representing Timken Co., Murray Energy and the American Health Care Association. The bulk of his PAC money came from committees operated by GOP politicians and from businesses, according to a Center for Responsive Politics breakdown of Renacci’s donations. During the campaign, Renacci was up front about his political action committee backing, putting out news releases when well known conservative PACS like the Family Research Council Action PAC, the Ohio Right to Life PAC, the House Conservatives Fund, and The Citizens United Political Victory Fund, announced they’d back him. Dictionaries define a hypocrite as someone whose actions contradict their stated beliefs. While Renacci publicly denounced Boccieri for accepting a large proportion of PAC money, he accepted PAC money himself all along, and continues to do so. He also publicly touted some of the ideological group PACs that backed his campaign. So while there is an element of hypocrisy given Renacci’s past criticism, the DCCC’s indignation needs to be put in context, especially since its candidate received a majority of his contributions from PACs. If Renacci’s PAC fundraising begins to outstrip his individual fundraising, he could end up deeper in hypocrisy territory. Meantime, we say the DCCC’s charge is Half True.

pomt-12915	"We give (foreign aid) to developing countries, and 70 percent of it's stolen off the top."	false	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/17/rand-paul/no-70-foreign-aid-not-stolen-top/	The United States spends about $50 billion on foreign aid, or about 1 percent of the entire federal budget. Much of it, whether in the form of development, health, humanitarian or military aid, involves the State Department at some point in the process. So at a confirmation hearing for Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., asked Tillerson about corruption in foreign aid. "There are many, many, many reports talking about corruption within foreign aid," Paul said. "That we give it to developing countries, and 70 percent of it's stolen off the top." Tillerson answered that he had once seen military forces steal shipments of food aid right at the airport. He said that sort of thing could be avoided if America picked the right partners to deliver aid. In this fact-check, we decided to take a closer look at Paul’s 70 percent figure. Across the board There is no question that the aid bucket can leak. Sergio Gor, Paul’s spokesman, told us Paul "was pointing out how often foreign aid is stolen." But neither Paul’s office nor any expert we reached could point to any study that found that 70 percent of what we give winds up stolen. Gor sent us an article by noted aid researcher William Easterly at New York University that argued something altogether different. Easterly wrote that as of 2008, 76 percent of all American aid went to countries judged by the private consulting group PRS to be most corrupt. Does that mean all that money was lost? No. The corruption ranking is an indirect measure at best. It aims to help businesses figure out the risk of investing in a country and puts the most weight on patronage, nepotism and "suspiciously close ties between politics and business." Easterly himself told us that his analysis is "suggestive" but in no way conclusive that 70 percent of aid money is stolen. "It is inherently impossible to calculate the number ‘x percent of aid is stolen’ from the numbers that I use on how much aid goes to corrupt countries," Easterly said. "The actual stealing of aid happens mostly in secret, using many tricks intended to deceive any outside observers. So nobody knows how much is actually stolen." Easterly wrote recently that in the name of fighting terrorism, the United States has "redirected aid money to some of the most autocratic, corrupt, and oppressive regimes in the world" such as Uzbekistan, Ethiopia and Uganda. He argued that this increased the risk of money going astray, but again, he said he couldn’t quantify the diversion. Morten Broberg, a law professor at Copenhagen University, focuses on corruption in development assistance and humanitarian aid. "I do not recall coming across any detailed and convincing statistics," Broberg told us. Broberg called the 70 percent figure incorrect. Worst case examples Gor, Paul’s spokesman, told us "there have been entire projects which have been fraudulently executed." He pointed to an op-ed about Nigeria that claimed, without any documentation, that hundreds of billions of dollars had been stolen from the government since 1960, an amount nearly equal to the foreign aid donors had sent. He also cited an Economist article that said that a year after Western governments had given the African nation of Malawi $1.2 billion, "corrupt officials, businessmen and politicians pinched at least $30 million from the Malawian treasury." If true, that would be a lot of money, but it would amount to about 2.5 percent of the total aid -- not 70 percent. Providing aid in war zones is particularly susceptible to fraud. Government auditors for the U.S. Agency for International Development investigated 25 cases of fraud and corruption within the humanitarian aid effort in Syria. In one case, a Turkish vendor had replaced lentils with salt in food ration kits for Syrians running from the fighting. Out of $835 million spent, they said their investigations "resulted in more than $11.5 million in savings." They also said at one point, as much as $300 million worth of program work was on hold, pending review. That does not mean fraud or theft had taken all that money. About a quarter of those funds were later allowed to move forward. Afghanistan and Iraq are major sinkholes of American aid. A 2014 Special Inspector General report on Afghanistan reconstruction said about $1.6 billion in aid was flowing through ministries that "were unable to manage and account for funds." The report did not estimate how much aid was stolen. The report said that even when U.S. Agency for International Development staff knew that controls were weak, they continued to approve grants. For Iraq, the congressional Commission on Wartime Contracting estimated that the cost of fraud "ran between 5 and 9 percent" between 2002 and 2011. That amounted to as much as $18.5 billion over that period. Our ruling Paul said that 70 percent of foreign aid is "stolen off the top." Paul’s office was unable to point to a study that backed that up for all American aid, and experts who study the issue knew of no such estimate. While theft is real, and possibly extreme on individual projects, it is not on the scale Paul asserted. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c2956347-4ba9-4b1b-a0a9-2794c2448aa9	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2017-01-17T17:04:19	2017-01-11	['None']
pomt-01799	"Last year, I was involved with an effort to to help prosecutors get their first pay raise in more than 10 years."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/24/jon-richards/assistant-district-attorneys-didnt-get-raises-over/	In campaigning for state attorney general, state Rep. Jon Richards made a claim that made us wonder how prosecutors in district attorney’s offices across Wisconsin have been getting by. In a video released June 16, 2014, the Milwaukee Democrat stated: "Last year, I was involved with an effort to to help prosecutors get their first pay raise in more than 10 years." No raises for more than a decade? No. But let us explain. The background The main job of the state's locally elected district attorneys and the assistants they hire is to prosecute felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well as well juvenile cases, in circuit court. Wisconsin has 72 counties but 71 district attorneys, as one DA serves both Menominee and Shawano counties. The assistant district attorneys were county employees until 1990, when a change in state law made them state employees and allowed them to collectively bargain for wages. The pay for the assistants has been a concern for years. A University of Wisconsin-Madison study in 2011 that called for raises found that dating back 2005, annual turnover among assistant district attorneys exceeded 18 percent. Richards’ evidence We asked Richards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda for evidence to back the claim that Richards helped get prosecutors their first pay raise in more than 10 years. He suggested we contact David Feiss, a Milwaukee County assistant district attorney and president of the Association of State Prosecutors, the statewide union for assistant DAs. Feiss told us it would be wrong to say the state’s prosecutors have not received any pay raises in more than a decade. Indeed, contracts that the union negotiated with the state provided a number of across-the-board raises, as the UW-Madison study noted: Year pay raise effective Amount of raise 2004 1 percent, plus 10 cents/hour, plus $250 lump sum 2005 2 percent 2006 2 percent 2007 April: 2.25 percent; July: 2 percent plus $1.25/hour 2008 1 percent So, how can Richards claim there were no raises? Feiss pointed out to us that the contract covering 2003-’05, unlike previous contracts, contained no provision for merit pay raises and that subsequent contracts have not, either. In other words, assistant district attorneys couldn’t advance in pay beyond the across-the-board raises. That changed after the Legislature in 2012 created a new merit pay structure, which was implemented as part of the 2013-’15 state budget. As Richards noted, he helped lead that effort. The new pay progression plan consists of 18 hourly salary steps, from $49,429 on the low end to $119,471 at the top. Each step is worth $4,120. Effective in July 2013, prosecutors were moved up in pay by one step. And going forward, based on merit, they can get a raise of one step or more each year, although the total annual raise cannot exceed 10 percent. Our rating Richards said that in 2013, he "was involved with an effort to to help prosecutors get their first pay raise in more than 10 years." Since a merit pay system was eliminated in 2003, assistant district attorneys could not get merit raises or "step" raises -- to a higher place on the pay scale -- until a new merit and step-pay system was put in place in 2013, with Richards’ help. But prior to that, they received across-the-board raises for five consecutive years, from 2004 through 2008. We rate Richards’ statement False.

pomt-10164	"My plan offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain's."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/30/barack-obama/are-you-middle-class/	Middle class. According to a recent study, more than half of Americans say that’s what they are. More than a third of Americans with incomes below $20,000 describe themselves as middle class. So do a third of people with incomes above $150,000. The government doesn't officially define the "middle class." But this much is certain: Since most people consider themselves middle class, politicians want their vote. In a recent campaign ad focusing on economic issues, Sen. Barack Obama directly appealed to this important constituency. "Instead of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest — I’ll focus on you," Obama said. "My plan offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain’s." The claim refers to a report from the Tax Policy Center, which analyzed the tax plans of Sens. Obama and John McCain after interviews with their top economic advisers. The analysts concluded that under Obama’s plan, people with incomes in the middle 20 percent would see their federal income tax burden go down by $1,118 in 2009. Under McCain’s plan, those same people would see their federal taxes cut by $325. That’s more than "three times as much tax relief." But a couple qualifiers are in order. First, those figures are for just one year of Obama's tax plan, 2009. If you look down the road, say at 2012, those in the middle quintile would see tax cuts of $2,197 under Obama’s plan; $1,441 under McCain’s. Not "three times as much." Also consider that the middle 20 percent of incomes translates to people making between $37,595 and $66,354. Suppose you consider yourself middle class, but you make between $66,354 and $111,645 (in the 60 to 80 percent quintile). Then Obama’s plan would translate to a tax cut of $1,264 in 2007, as opposed to a cut of $994 under McCain’s plan. Not "three times as much." "Like all of these things, everyone is cherry-picking the facts," said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. Obama’s claim that his tax plan would result in three times as much tax relief for the middle class "is for one year (2009), not the whole lifespan of the tax plan," Williams said. "There’s so many things happening at different times in the plan." The nonpartisan, business-backed Tax Foundation points out another caveat. The tables cited by the Obama campaign in the Tax Policy Center analysis don’t include the candidates’ health care plans. The McCain camp has argued that some of his biggest proposed tax cuts for the middle class come through his idea to replace the income tax exclusion of employer-paid health insurance with a refundable income tax credit of $2,500 for individual coverage or $5,000 for family coverage. Obama has a direct pay plan that would provide subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase insurance, as well as a mandate for health insurance coverage for children. As both health plans are not part of the tax code, it’s probably not fair to include them in a head-to-head comparison of McCain’s and Obama’s tax plans. But the Tax Policy Center did provide a preliminary report that concluded that under McCain’s health care plan, people with incomes in the middle 20 percent would see after-tax income increase by $1,559 in 2009. Under Obama’s health plan, those folks would see their income rise $269. While it’s not fair to simply add the difference between those figures to the earlier analysis, "it’s probably safe to say that if you include McCain’s health care tax cuts, you do not get this three times greater figure" that Obama cited, said Gerald Prante, a senior economist with the Tax Foundation. And then there’s the issue of defining the middle class. Is it the middle 20 percent? The middle 60 percent? It’s certainly fair for Obama to pick the middle 20 percent. But picking, say, the middle 60 percent would yield much different results. This much we can say for sure: A higher fraction of Obama’s tax cuts would go to the middle class than McCain’s. Perhaps the most stark contrast in tax distribution comes for those in the top quintile, people making more than $111,645. Under Obama’s plan, those folks, on average, would be paying $3,017 a year more in federal taxes in 2007, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. Under McCains plan, they would be paying $6,498 less. As for Obama’s claim that his plan offers "three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain’s," it’s true for one year, and under one sensible definition of middle class. But since it’s not true when you look at the fourth year of the plan — and we are talking about electing a president for four years — we rate Obama’s claim Half True.

pomt-03418	The Senate immigration bill "has immediate legalization ... and the border security is sometime in the future, and just like in 1986, it's designed never to come into being."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/27/ted-cruz/border-security-immigration-bill-designed-never/	A 1986 immigration law signed by President Ronald Reagan casts a long shadow over the current immigration reform debate. Opponents of today’s immigration bill say that law gave away the farm -- it granted amnesty and failed to button down the border -- and they don’t want to see history repeat itself. This was the main argument from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in a Fox News interview. On the day a key amendment passed a crucial Senate vote, Cruz warned that the bill "has immediate legalization ... and the border security is sometime in the future, and just like in 1986, it's designed never to come into being." Cruz and the Senate Republican leadership say the border must be able to keep people out before those who are here without documents are given any path to legal status. To do otherwise, they argue, would only invite a flood of unauthorized immigration. We’ll examine both parts of Cruz’s statement. Does legalization come before the border is secure? And is border security treated as it was in the 1986 law and "designed to never come to pass"? Defining legalization The matter of when legalization happens is relatively easy to resolve, although we found two different meanings to the word. For some, such as Cruz, it means any formal status that allows a person to stay and work in the U.S., even temporarily. For others, it means permanent legal residency, often referred to as a green card. The Senate bill, grants what it calls "registered provisional immigrant" status, or RPI. This is not a green card granting permanent legal status; but it does mean a person has passed a criminal record check, paid a fine, and met other requirements. With provisional status, a person can stay and work for at least six years. However, under an amendment crafted by John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Bob Corker, R- Tenn., no one can apply for that until the Department of Homeland Security puts together and launches a border control plan (formally called the Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and the Southern Border Fencing Strategy). There’s also a similar status for agricultural workers called a blue card. Is either status legalization? Cruz would certainly say yes. More important, so does the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the analytic arm of Congress. The CBO’s assessment of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, the bill’s formal title, tallies the number of people expected to qualify under the new rules. In one table, it lists legalization programs and under that are the provisional status (RPI) and the blue card. We checked with the CBO and there is no mistake. The provisional status and the blue card are legalization in the eyes of the CBO. We also contacted the Migration Policy Institute, a group that studies population movements worldwide. The institute defines legalization the same way as the CBO. Supporters of immigration reform often focus on the rules and timing for getting a green card and consider that to be legalization, but the CBO definition carries great weight in this debate. Getting back to the bill, a border security plan must be underway before people can begin to apply, but that security plan need not be completed. The CBO estimates the application process wouldn’t begin until sometime in fiscal year 2015, but it would come before all border tightening measures are in place. Hardening the border If Cruz had stopped with legalization, he would have been on more solid ground, but he went further and said the Senate bill neglects border security. He said it was like the 1986 reform act, and he went so far as to say it was "designed" to lead to nowhere. We asked Cruz’s office for specific supporting evidence. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier noted several deficiencies in the Hoeven-Corker amendment, including that it fails to require a biometric system -- such as a retina scan -- for monitoring people as they enter and leave the country. But even more fundamental is the timing in the legislation. "The border security assets required by the amendment have to be in place 10 years in the future before illegal immigrants can obtain green cards," Frazier said. "Meaning border security does not have to happen if an administration does not care about giving them green cards… and just leaving them as RPIs in perpetuity. "There is no guarantee in this bill that the border will ever be secured, so we essentially have a bill that offers legalization and little else." Frazier said. The CBO analyzed the Hoeven-Corker amendment, which has become the latest version of the bill. The report said, "The proposed amendment would appropriate $46.3 billion for expenses related to the security of the southern U.S. border and initial administrative costs." About $30 billion would go to hire at least 19,200 additional border patrol agents; close to $8 billion would go to building a fence along the border. There is an important verb in that sentence from the CBO. It is "appropriate." Congress controls the purse strings on government spending. The smallest step it can take is to authorize money. Authorized dollars mean little until Congress takes the real step and appropriates the money. Appropriations, on the other hand, are actual dollars that are there for an agency to spend. The Senate bill appropriates over $46 billion to beef up border security. The time frame for most of the spending is 2014 to 2018. Cruz said this is "just like 1986." We looked at the 1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act. When it comes to border security, it only authorized spending. The current bill both authorizes and actually appropriates spending for border security. It sets aside a designated pot of money -- the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund -- and it puts $46.3 billion into it by Oct. 1, 2013. Taking note of the sequence of events, if the bill becomes law, the agencies start spending money on agents and other measures immediately. The bill sets many goals for border enforcement. Beyond the new patrol agents, it adds 350 miles of fencing and creates an entry/exit system to track not just when people enter the country but when they leave. It requires all employers to use an employment verification system. Our ruling Cruz said the Senate immigration bill offers immediate legalization of unauthorized immigrants and that it indefinitely defers action on border security. Cruz said this bill was just like the major reform bill in 1986. On legalization, the process would not be immediate, but as the CBO uses the term, it would come before the border is fully secured. Proponents of the bill refer to this as "provisional" status. By and large, immigrants could not apply to receive permanent legalized status until border security meets certain benchmarks. The Senate measure also appropriates more than $46 billion for border security and makes that money available immediately. So Cruz is wrong to say the security measures are designed "never to come into being." Cruz was reasonably accurate on legalization but was way off the mark on the bill’s border security being "designed never to come into being." We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-14029	"More people today are leaving Virginia than moving in."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/31/nikki-haley/nikki-haley-more-people-today-are-leaving-virginia/	South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley came to Richmond recently and torched Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s management of the state’s economy. Haley came to endorse and raise money for fellow Republican Ed Gillespie, who plans to run for governor in 2017. She said Virginia has taken a "nose dive" since McAuliffe, a Democrat, took office in 2014 and is a "non-issue" in the competition among states to recruit new businesses. At a forum arranged by Gillespie’s PAC, Haley hearkened to the days of Gov. Bob McDonnell, McAuliffe’s Republican predecessor. "Virginia was a tough guy to beat," she said, adding, "... and then, to turn it around and find out what no state ever wants: More people today are leaving Virginia than moving in." She made a similar statement a half-hour later while talking to reporters. "Most disturbing is that you’ve got more people leaving Virginia than coming in," Haley said. "That’s a sign of an economy that is going down, and going down fast." We wondered if it’s true that more people are exiting than entering the state. It’s a claim that Gillespie has previously made, foreshadowing a campaign that will promise economic change. Gillespie, noting PolitiFact’s presence among the journalists covering Haley’s visit, provided on-the-spot sourcing for her comments. He said they were based on 2013 data from the Internal Revenue Service. The numbers The IRS publishes annual statistics on the number of households that moved and filed federal tax returns from a different state than the one in which they lived the previous year. Demographers and economists use these figures to track the "net migration" of families in the U.S. from year to year. The data show that from 1991 through 2012, Virginia always had more families coming in than going out. That changed in 2013, when there was a net loss of 3,082 households. In 2014, the last year for which figures are available, Virginia lost a net of 12,463 households. This doesn’t mean there’s been a massive flow out of Virginia. To give some perspective, about 3.8 million Virginia households annually file federal taxes. The combined net losses to other states in 2013 and 2014 come to less than half of 1 percent of households. The U.S. Census Bureau also tracks net migration through an annual survey. It estimates that Virginia gained a net of 3,099 people through domestic migration during a 12 month period that ended July 1, 2013. Then, the state had had estimated net losses of 20,400 for the 12 months ending at the start of July 2014, and 23,813 for the 12 months ending in July 2015. The reason Jobs are the main reason people are leaving Virginia for other states, said James V. Koch, an economist and former president of Old Dominion University. Virginia is home to large military bases and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers which drive the economy of Northern Virginia. It has been hurt in recent years by efforts to curb federal spending through sequestration programs. Koch and other state economists have said those efforts largely are responsible for Virginia’s flat economic growth in 2014, the latest year for which statistics are available. Only two states did worse: Mississippi and Alaska. The result, Koch said, is that many Virginians whose paychecks were dependent on federal spending, particularly for defense, have left the state in recent years for new jobs. Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, wrote an article in September that also cited sequestration as a reason people were leaving Virginia. Lombard added that more retirees are exiting Virginia than coming into the state. Overall population All of these migration figures might give you the impression that Virginia’s overall population is declining, but that’s not the case. Virginia’s population is growing every year. It expanded from 8 million in 2010 to an estimated 8.38 million in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. What explains the seeming contradiction? Again, net migration is a narrow statistic that measures the number of people or households moving to different states. It doesn’t take into account the two much larger influences on population: •More people are being born in Virginia than are dying here, and •More people are coming into Virginia as first-year immigrants and temporary foreign workers and students than are leaving to live in other countries. Now let’s get back Haley. Her claim that more people are moving out of Virginia than into the state doesn’t count immigrants. If we include them, her claim unravels. The most current figures from the Census Bureau - tracking the 12-month period that ended on July 1, 2015 - shows an estimated net gain of about 39,000 such foreigners in Virginia compared with a net loss of about 24,000 people who moved to a different state. Put together, the numbers suggest there was a net gain of almost 15,000 people who chose to move to Virginia during those 12 months. Final note: As we’ve said many times previously, governors have little control over the economies of their states. In this case, Haley holds McAuliffe responsible for problems that economists say resulted largely from sequestration actions begun by Congress and the White House in March 2013 - nine months before McAuliffe became governor. McAuliffe took office in January 2014. The IRS data show the first year Virginia experienced a net loss of households was 2013. Census data suggest the losses began swelling in the latter half of 2013. Our ruling Haley said, "More people are leaving Virginia today than moving in." She made her statement in a partisan attack on McAuliffe’s economic stewardship, saying Virginia no longer is competitive in attracting and keeping businesses. Her claim was based on IRS data on the number of people who moved and filed tax returns from a different state than the one in which they lived the previous year. Economists and demographers use these figures to chart migration in states. In 2014, Virginia had a net loss of 12,463 households to other states. The latest Census Bureau figures estimate Virginia lost a net of 23,813 people to other states during a 12-month period ending in July 2015. Because Haley was talking in the context of Virginia competing with other states, we think her claim largely holds up. But there’s a caveat. If you add first-year immigrants and temporary foreign workers and students to the mix, then annual Census Bureau estimates show more people continue to enter Virginia than leave it.

pomt-08944	"Of all the illegals in America, more than half come through Arizona."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/23/john-mccain/mccain-campaign-ad-claims-more-half-illegal-immigr/	One of the points of contention over Arizona's tough new immigration law is the number of illegal immigrants pouring into the state. And it's an issue Sen. John McCain, who was a leader in the bipartisan efforts for immigration reform in 2007, has taken up in campaign ads. "Drug and human smuggling, home invasions, murder," says McCain as he walks along the border fence in Nogales, Ariz., with Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu. "We're outmanned," says Babeu, matching McCain's slow pace, hands together behind his back, in an ad known as "Complete the danged fence" that was posted to YouTube on May 7, 2010. "Of all the illegals in America, more than half come through Arizona." That number seemed high to us, so we decided to check it out. Because the claim was made in an ad produced by the McCain campaign rather than Babeu himself, we are attributing it to the McCain campaign. We found the numbers were different than the ad claimed. It is true that about 45 percent of immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally most likely cross through Arizona, according to statistics on apprehension rates published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Apprehension rates appear to be closely correlated to actual rates of entry, according to Jeff Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center. However, not all illegal immigrants enter the country illegally. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 40 to 50 percent of all people residing illegally in the U.S. actually entered the country legally, according to a report cited in congressional testimony by John Morton, assistant secretary of homeland security for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For example, they came as tourists or on a temporary visa, and then overstayed their visit. A 2005 report published by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 30 to 40 percent of people with visas stay longer than they are permitted. "Only slightly more than half (of all illegal immigrants) sneak into the country," said Passel, adding that the data on those who enter legally shows that "very few come through Arizona." So the McCain ad overreaches by saying that "more than half" of the illegal immigrants come through Arizona. While it is true that 45 percent of the immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally come through the state, the total number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. also includes the "overstayers," so the percentage coming through Arizona ends up being lower. We couldn't find a precise estimate on the percentage of illegal immigrants who crossed through Arizona, but estimates indicate it's much lower than the figure cited in McCain's ad. For example, if you assume 50 percent of the current illegal immigrants in this country entered illegally, then only 22.5 percent crossed through Arizona. Even if you assume that 70 percent entered the country illegally, a high estimate, then only 31.5 percent entered through Arizona. The McCain ad would have been right if it said, "Of all the people who enter this country illegally, nearly half come through Arizona." But the claim as worded is pretty far off. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

The original statement was simply, "People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result of the law." Controversy surrounding the Affordable Care Act isn’t going away anytime soon. Republicans have vowed to make Obamacare a central theme of the 2014 campaign, while Democrats insist that troubles with the initial rollout are subsiding and that millions of Americans now have health insurance as a result of the law. A new congressional report on the law, meanwhile, appears to stoke potential arguments on both sides. U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby toured Oregon recently, meeting with 100 business owners in as many days. Wehby is running for the GOP nomination to face Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. During a stop in La Grande, Wehby said the new law threatens to hinder Oregon’s efforts to dig out of the Great Recession. "We obviously have a lot of concerns about the health care law," she told a gathering of about 15 people at a La Grande coffee shop. "People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result of the law." There have been many claims about the Affordable Care Act, but this one caught our attention. Is the law causing businesses to shrink? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We contacted Wehby’s campaign and got a response from Charlie Pearce, her communications manager. In addition to providing links to national news stories reporting that some major companies are cutting employee hours to avoid ACA-related insurance costs, he directed us to Robert Decker, owner of Westcare Healthcare Management in Salem, a company that operates health care facilities for veterans and the disabled in several states. Decker said costs associated with the new law prompted him to sell three care facilities in Idaho in 2012. When he ran the numbers, he found it would cost him between $800,000 and $1 million to provide health insurance for the 650 employees he had in Idaho at the time. Spending that much money on insurance, Decker said, would have rendered those businesses unprofitable. "The health care law was a big driving force in our selling those facilities," Decker said. "It had a big impact on us, no question." Two supervisors with the company that bought the bulk of Westcare Management’s Idaho holdings confirmed the March 2012 sale. Both declined to give their names, saying they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the transaction. The company’s human resources director did not return our calls. To gauge the accuracy of Decker’s health-care costs claim, we called T.J. Sullivan, a partner in Huggins Insurance in Salem. His agency has been advising Oregon businesses on how the health care law affects them. The average premium for ACA-approved business plans runs about $250 to $300 a month, he said, with management picking up about half of that. Assuming costs of $125 per month for 650 workers, Westcare Management’s costs under the new law would run roughly $975,000 annually, Sullivan said. On that score, Decker’s assertion checks out. Decker’s company is privately held and he declined to discuss profits, however, so we weren’t able to independently verify that a cost of $800,000 to $1 million would have rendered the businesses unprofitable. Sullivan said he has seen effects of the new law locally, as well. One provision, the so-called employer mandate, has been delayed until 2015. It requires businesses that employ more than 50 people -- who all work at least 30 hours a week -- to provide insurance to their workers. However, Sullivan said he is working with at least one Salem-area company in that category that’s trimming hours to get employees under 30 per week. The company has multiple locations and employs about 100 Salem-area residents. The company’s owner, Sullivan said, is aiming to trim work hours to get 60 to 75 of those employees under the 30-hour threshold. The owner isn’t hiring workers to fill the gap -- nor laying anyone off, Sullivan said. He declined to name the company, saying that he wanted the owner to speak for himself. The owner did not return our calls. From Sullivan’s description, however, the business is "shrinking." A new report from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that the new law will mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021 as hours are reduced. The report contains an important caveat, however, in noting that many of those losses will be voluntary as people opt to keep their incomes low to remain eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid. Next, we wondered whether state employment data reflect either trend -- larger companies not hiring that 51st employee or smaller ones hiring more part-time employees to avoid health-insurance requirements. Not according to a blog entry posted Nov. 6, 2013, by Josh Lehner, senior economist in the state Office of Economic Analysis. "Here in Oregon," Lehner wrote, "over 90 percent of the jobs added between 2009 and 2012 have been full-time positions, on net." Later in the post, he added, "Of course, the so-called ‘employer mandate’ under the health law doesn’t take effect until 2015, so it’s possible that employers are simply waiting to cut hours until closer to the deadline. But there’s little evidence they’ve started yet." Clarity on the issue may not be coming anytime soon. According to Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, "This is a really tough one to get a handle on. Even after enough time has passed for the impacts of the law to show up in the aggregate data, these impacts will be difficult to isolate." Oregon, like the rest of the country, continues to wrestle with the Affordable Care Act. The two major political parties are largely split on whether it represents government overreach or the best way to control health-care spending while providing insurance to those who don’t have it. Wehby told a small audience in La Grande that "People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result." It’s true that Wehby said businesses are "having" to shrink their operations. There’s a nuance there suggesting businesses are being compelled to make cuts. Because we can’t assess motives, we chose to look more narrowly at whether businesses are or are not making cutbacks in response to the law, accepting that the overwhelming majority would be acting with their businesses’ bottom line in mind. Wehby’s campaign provided an example of a significant scaling back of an Oregon-based business, though aspects could not be independently verified. She also gave us links to national news stories reporting similar cuts elsewhere. An Oregon consultant also outlined an example of a business trimming employee hours as a result of the law.

pomt-08966	"We're not engaged in nation-building" in Afghanistan.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/20/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-us-not-engaged-nation-building-afgh/	During a July 18, 2010, interview on ABC's This Week, Vice President Joe Biden made a clear characterization of U.S. policy in Afghanistan. "If you notice, what we have is a counter-insurgency plan along the spine of the country, where the population is," Biden said. "It's not a nationwide counter-insurgency plan. We're not engaged in nation-building, which the original discussion was about. We have ... a date where we're going to go look and see whether it's working. And we have a timetable in which to transition." The part that caught our eye was the notion that the United States is "not engaged in nation-building." We thought it would be worth seeing whether that's a fair characterization of what the U.S. is doing. Our initial challenge was to define what "nation-building" actually means. One concise definition offered in America's Role in Nation-Building: From Germany to Iraq, a 2003 study by the RAND Corp, is "to use military force to underpin a process of democratization. Substitute "stablilization" or "reconstruction" for "democratization" -- as many recent commentators have done -- and that serves as our definition. We should start by noting that the term isn't exactly in favor these days. In recent years, "nation-building" has variously taken hits from the right, for seeming to place battle-hardened troops in softer roles of promoting civic society, and from the left, for fear of an open-ended military commitment. "Labeling it as such would help discredit such interventions," said Ivan Eland, a senior fellow at the Independent Institute, a libertarian think tank, and author of an upcoming book on counterinsurgency warfare. True to form, the Obama Administration avoids the term "nation-building" as if it were allergic to the concept. We were unable to find any instance in which a White House official used the term to describe what was actually happening on the ground in Afghanistan. Just about the only time the term is used is when the administration seeks to explain what the U.S. is not doing. In a Dec. 1, 2009, speech at the U.S. Military Academy intended to outline the administration's policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Obama said that "there are those who oppose identifying a time frame for our transition to Afghan responsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation-building project of up to a decade. I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan." Two days later, in Congressional testimony, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sounded the same note. "This approach is not open-ended 'nation building,'" Gates said. "It is neither necessary nor feasible to create a modern, centralized, Western-style Afghan nation-state -- the likes of which has never been seen in that country. Nor does it entail pacifying every village and conducting textbook counterinsurgency from one end of Afghanistan to the other. It is, instead, a narrower focus tied more tightly to our core goal of disrupting, dismantling and eventually defeating al-Qaida by building the capacity of the Afghans -- capacity that will be measured by observable progress on clear objectives, and not simply by the passage of time." The administration is essentially arguing that it is not undertaking "nation-building," first, because the goal of strengthening civil society in Afghanistan is secondary to the narrower goal of taking on al-Qaida, and second, because the U.S. role in the mission is not one that will keep personnel on the ground indefinitely. Marvin Weinbaum, a former Afghanistan specialist at the State Department and now a scholar at the Middle East Institute, said the U.S. will have an interest in supporting Afghanistan's development long after the troops leave. But since the context of Biden's comment was a discussion of military policy, we'll keep our analysis narrowly focused on military-led nation-building. Meanwhile, Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that "nation-building" is not only a loaded term, "it's also a vague term." Some foreign-policy experts say the administration has some justification for distinguishing between current U.S. policy and "nation-building." While we did not receive any clarification from the Vice President's office, O'Hanlon said that "in Afghanistan, our goals are relatively limited to ensuring some semblance of security and stability. In that sense, the vice president is right" that the mission in Afghanistan is more limited than full nation-building would be, O'Hanlon said. Lawrence Korb -- a former Defense Department official under President Ronald Reagan who now serves as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal group with close ties to the Obama Administration -- added that the time element is important too. A strict interpretation of the term "nation-building" would suggest that the U.S. would "literally stay until everything was secure and a functioning government was in place." But the administration is saying that the Afghans "have 18 months to shape up," Korb said. That 18 months would end in July 2011, according to current plans. That said, both O'Hanlon and Korb agreed that there is significant substantive overlap between what goes on under the traditional definition of "nation-building" and what the U.S. is doing in Afghanistan. "There certainly are major elements of what one might call 'state-building' going on, starting with creation of a strong army and police," O'Hanlon said. Indeed, key policy documents outline a variety of duties that would seem to fit well within our definition of nation-building. The administration's National Security Strategy document released in May 2010 says that the U.S. "will continue to work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan Government to improve accountable and effective governance. As we work to advance our strategic partnership with the Afghan Government, we are focusing assistance on supporting the president of Afghanistan and those ministries, governors, and local leaders who combat corruption and deliver for the people. Our efforts will be based upon performance, and we will measure progress. We will also target our assistance to areas that can make an immediate and enduring impact in the lives of the Afghan people, such as agriculture, while supporting the human rights of all of Afghanistan’s people--women and men. This will support our long-term commitment to a relationship between our two countries that supports a strong, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan." If this sounds a lot like nation-building, so does a portion of the Army's Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which was authored by Gen. David Petraeus in 2006. While the document was written during the Bush Administration, it still holds significant sway, especially given that Petraeus is now the top commander in Afghanistan. One portion of the manual says that "particularly after security has been achieved, dollars and ballots will have more important effects than bombs and bullets. This is a time when 'money is ammunition.' Depending on the state of the insurgency, therefore, Soldiers and Marines should prepare to execute many non-military missions to support (counterinsurgency) efforts." It even goes so far as to use the now-taboo words: "Everyone has a role in nation-building, not just Department of State and civil affairs personnel." Another portion of the manual says that "success in (counterinsurgency) operations requires small-unit leaders agile enough to transition among many types of missions and able to adapt to change. They must be able to shift through a number of activities from nation-building to combat and back again in days, or even hours." Such overlap suggests that for the current administration, the difference between its policy in Afghanistan and nation-building is, to a certain extent, one of nomenclature. Doug Bandow, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said, "Of course they are engaged in nation-building, and of course they are denying it." Eland added, "They are simply doing it and using a different name." So let's recap. When Biden says that "we're not engaged in nation-building" in Afghanistan, he's correct that the administration doesn't use that word, and that the U.S. commitment is narrower and more time-limited than a nation-building effort might be. However, many of the things the U.S. is seeking to do in Afghanistan would fall under a reasonable definition of what used to be known as nation-building. So while we acknowledge the limits of U.S. military intentions in Afghanistan, we don't think it's right to let the vice president simply deny the existence of the types of activities formerly identified with "nation building" by disavowing the phrase. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2010-07-20T11:26:21	2010-07-18	['Afghanistan']

pomt-03667	Says "Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/apr/27/mark-johnson/there-craft-brewery-every-legislative-district-ore/	The Oregon House voted recently to designate brewer’s yeast as the state microbe. House Concurrent Resolution 12, which honors Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is now in the hands of the Senate after receiving unanimous support in the House. Before it passed, resolution sponsor Rep. Mark Johnson, R-Hood River, hammered home the economic importance of craft breweries to Oregon. "Designating Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or brewer’s yeast, as the official microbe of the state of Oregon is an important recognition of the impact this little microbe has had on our state’s economy and on our culture," Johnson said. "Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers." All that craft brewery talk made PolitiFact Oregon feel rather parched. Had Johnson just mapped out a summer road trip for us to quench our thirst (for knowledge of Oregon political geography, of course)? Is there really at least one craft brewery in every legislative district in the state? Johnson’s office provided us with a list of breweries by Senate and House district. Every Senate district contains two House districts; we wanted to ensure at least one craft brewing facility exists in each of the 60 House districts. Johnson’s legislative aide, Rainier Butler, said it appeared that every district contained a craft brewery except House District 17, which covers Stayton, Lebanon and Scio. To double check Johnson’s data, we visited the Oregon Liquor Control Commission website and downloaded a spreadsheet of the more than 15,000 alcohol licenses issued by the state. We narrowed the list to the 222 facilities that had active brewery and brewery-public house licenses. These are facilities that make malt beverages and then sell them primarily at wholesale or retail. Mark Friesen, an online producer at The Oregonian, geocoded and mapped the 222 facilities by legislative district. The results confirmed that House District 17 lacks a licensed brewery, as does House District 47, which covers a large portion of East Portland, and House District 4, which covers Central Point, White City and Eagle Point. We checked with the offices of Rep. Dennis Richardson, a Central Point Republican who represents District 4; Rep. Sherrie Sprenger, a Scio Republican who represents District 17; and Jessica Vega Pederson, a Portland Democrat who represents District 47, to see if they knew of any craft brewing facilities in their districts. They did not, though their staff said it was not the type of information they kept close tabs on. We should also note that businesses constantly open and close, so perhaps a craft brewery in those districts recently closed unbeknownst to us or is slated to open soon. However, our map of OLCC licensed breweries also indicated that two more districts — 28 in Beaverton and Aloha, and 40 in Oregon City and Gladstone — lack craft breweries. Johnson’s office said those districts include a branch of McMenamins, which they believe count as craft breweries even if they don’t brew their own beer on site. We’re not sure we buy that. If they don’t brew their own beer on site, they’re just like any other bar serving beer brewed elsewhere. McMenamins does have one pub in each of those two districts, but company spokeswoman Renee Rank confirmed for us that the Beaverton and Oregon City pubs do not brew beer on site. The beer is brought in from other nearby breweries, she said. Lastly, we shared our findings with Brian Butenschoen, executive director of the Oregon Brewers Guild, which represents 103 brewing companies. He couldn’t think of any craft breweries in House Districts 4, 17 or 47, though all the other districts have at least one. "It’s pretty close, but I don’t think every single one does," he said. We asked him if a McMenamins pub that served beer brewed off-site would count in his book as a craft brewery. "It’s not a super-important distinction to most folks," he said. "Would I count that in my list of breweries? No." Our investigation found that districts 4, 17 and 47 do not have craft breweries. We’re also skeptical that a McMenamins pub that doesn’t brew on site qualifies as a craft brewery. "The vast majority of Oregon does have access to quality craft brewery products," Johnson said after we shared our findings. "The craft-brewing industry is incredibly fast growing. It continues to be a bright spot in the midst of an otherwise slow economy." Even if we exclude the two districts with McMenamins pubs, more than 90 percent of House and Senate districts in Oregon have at least one craft brewery. If Johnson had hedged his statement a bit and said that "nearly" every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery, this would be a True. But that’s not what he said. Johnson said in his floor speech that every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery. We rate this statement False — and hope to see you out on the beer trail soon to toast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	None	Mark Johnson	None	None	None	2013-04-27T03:00:00	2013-04-11	['None']
pomt-02787	Says Vladimir Putin said, "President Obama and his fellow Democrats are either idiots or deliberately trying to destroy their own economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/05/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-says-vladimir-putin-accused-barack-o/	After a bumpy rollout of his health care law, President Barack Obama has taken his share of criticism lately. But did that include some trash-talking by Russian President Vladimir Putin? This week, a reader forwarded us a Facebook meme with Putin’s picture and the quotation, "Any fourth grade history student knows socialism has failed in every country, at every time in history. President Obama and his Democrats are either idiots or deliberately trying to destroy their own economy." Did Putin really call his colleague Obama an idiot? You may wonder why you hadn’t heard about the large-scale diplomatic crisis. We did, too. So we took a look. As it turns out, the alleged quote is not new. It appeared repeatedly on social media during the past few years, surfacing on Facebook and far-flung corners of the Internet. As long ago as 2009, it surfaced on Godlike Productions, a site that regularly discusses UFOs and conspiracy theories. While some commenters questioned the quote’s veracity, many lauded it: "Even Putin knows history and he is an intellectual man-with EXPERIENCE. Regardless of his early years in KGB-he seems fairly aware and likely giving sound advice," wrote one user. Another site called "Obama sux" even used the quote as its motto, putting Putin’s name in Cyrillic letters – Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин – to add an authentic touch. But we just needed a little Web sleuthing to confirm that the original source of the quote was a blog post in February 2009, on a site called Scooter’s Report. It was part of a short article titled, "Putin: Obama ‘Idiot’ For Adopting Socialism." The article quoted Putin as saying that Russian history clearly proves Obama’s approach is a recipe for failure. It ended with this rebuttal by an Obama spokesman: "We're going to do socialism better." So what is Scooter’s Report? It’s a blog that mixes satirical articles with offensive, manipulated images of Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. It only appears to have been updated once since 2011. A different site, World News Bureau, is operated by the same blogger, publishing such posts as "Chris Matthews not allowed to masturabte during Obama interview" and "Unexplained Phenomena Reported At Monticello." The people distributing Putin’s alleged quote didn’t bother to look at a disclaimer on Scooter’s Report that says: "Like I have to tell you. This is fictitious satire and any resemblance to persons, places, or events is coincidental." Our ruling A recent Facebook meme said Vladimir Putin accused Obama of being an "idiot" for trying to implement socialism in the United States. The alleged quote has circulated online for almost six years, but we can say with confidence that the quote comes from a satire website, a truth that could have been easily discovered through a few clicks on the Internet.

pomt-13048	Says that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, "you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses" spike.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/nov/23/james-quintero/james-quintero-says-salmonella-and-other-illnesses/	Reused grocery bags made Californians sick, a conservative Texas analyst suggested. James Quintero, director of the Center for Local Governance at the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation, brought up health implications of shoppers reusing bags during an Oct. 10, 2016, SXSW Eco panel discussion. "There are health consequences in that," Quintero said. "I believe this is in San Francisco: When they enacted their bag ban, you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses—you saw that number spike." Someone on the panel responded: "Wait, that’s curious. I never heard that before." Quintero replied: "So you have a reusable bag, right? And then of course, people don’t clean out these bags. So when you mix meat with vegetables and fruits and other goods, and you don’t clean out that bag on a regular basis, then people are susceptible to foodborne illnesses." Take note: Health authorities recommend you wash bags regularly used to carry meats and vegetables. For this fact check, we were curious about what happened when San Francisco banned plastic bags. Quintero cites professors’ paper We asked a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, to share the basis of Quintero’s claim. By email, Espinosa pointed us to a November 2012 paper, "Grocery Bag Bans and Foodborne Illness," by Jonathan Klick and Joshua Wright, law professors at the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University, respectively. In their write-up, posted by a University of Pennsylvania research center, the authors noted that San Francisco County barred large supermarkets and pharmacies from using "non-compostable plastic checkout bags," effective Oct. 20, 2007. In 2012, the county’s board of supervisors "expanded the non-compostable plastic checkout bag ban to cover all retail and food establishments in" the county, effective Oct. 1, 2012, the paper says, also requiring stores to charge at least a dime for any bag provided. "To analyze emergency room visits," the authors wrote, "we used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development’s Emergency Department and Ambulatory Surgery Data for each quarter from 2005-2010. These data provide the county of residence of each person admitted to a California ER, as well as the principal diagnosis for the individual using ICD-9 codes. Given the prevalence of coliform bacteria, especially E. coli, in reusable grocery bags, we focus on ER visits involving E. coli," the two said. And? The San Francisco bag ban is "associated with a statistically significant and particularly large increase in ER visits for E. Coli infections. We find increases between one fourth and two thirds, suggesting an increase in visits between 72 and 191 annually," the paper said. All told, the authors said, the bag ban there is "associated with a 46 percent increase in deaths from foodborne illnesses. This implies an increase of 5.5 annual deaths for the county." On the other hand, the study’s small sample size make "any inferential claims" tentative, the authors wrote. We emailed and telephoned each professor and didn’t hear back. San Francisco County memo Hunting perspective, we then ran the authors’ names through the Nexis news database. That query led us to a March 2013 story posted by Texas-based D Magazine stating a San Francisco health officer had spelled out flaws in the professors’ paper. That story included a web link to a Feb. 8, 2013, memo from a San Francisco County health officer, Tomás Aragon, to Eileen Shields, a county public health information officer. The memo said the county Department of Public Health had reviewed the professors’ paper which, the officer noted, "has not been submitted for rigorous scientific peer review and publication." Generally, the memo states, "Klick & Wright’s conclusion that San Francisco’s policy of banning of plastic bags has caused a significant increase in gastrointestinal bacterial infections and a ‘46 percent increase in the deaths from foodborne illnesses’ is not warranted." One weakness, the memo says, was that the professors presumed a link between reusable bags and a seeming spike in gastrointestinal bacterial infections--yet they failed to establish the link. "Drawing causal conclusions from this type of study is called an ‘ecological fallacy,’" the memo states. "The basic study flaw is that persons that use reusable bags frequently may not be the same persons that were diagnosed with gastrointestinal bacterial infections in their study. This is the reason epidemiologists will not use ecological studies to test causal hypotheses. At best, ecologic studies raise epidemiologic causal hypotheses but cannot test them." The memo continues: "In testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to measure the outcome (gastrointestinal infections) and exposure to the putative cause (reusable bags) in the same persons. Because of their study design, this was not possible." Also, the memo says that in "testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to ‘control for’ alternative causal explanations (called ‘confounders’). Because of their study design, this was not possible. For example, gastrointestinal bacterial infections are not only caused from contaminated food, but also from contaminated water, improper food handling or preparation, or from person-to-person spread (such as sexual activity, especially in men who have sex with men). In any causal study, investigators always adjust for the ‘usual suspects,’" the memo says. Moreover, the memo notes that the study’s focus on illnesses identified in emergency rooms misses that people seek care at other places--or not at all--leaving the data incomplete. Alternatively, the memo says, laboratory-confirmed diagnoses reported to the health department are "the proper basis for surveillance of microbiological data on these infections in our population." The official went on to say there had been increases in some illnesses oft linked to food. Specifically, according to the memo, health department data show an increase in campylobacteriosis, one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness. Then again, the memo says, there was no detected increase in salmonellosis or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which is transmitted by food or water contaminated with animal or human feces. "Interpreting these changes is not straightforward," the memo continues. "The epidemiology of enteric pathogens in San Francisco differs compared to surrounding counties because we are an urban center with a larger population of ethnic immigrants and men who have sex with men (MSM)," the memo states. "Research studies need to adjust for these population differences." The memo also disputes the professors’ conclusions about deaths going up after the bag ban, mostly by declaring that 111 of the 140 San Francisco deaths from 2001 through 2010 figuring into the paper were attributed to Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile--an intestinal infection most commonly tied to exposure to antibiotics, particularly among hospitalized patients. "Foodborne exposures is not yet an established cause of C. difficile enterocolitis, but is an active area of research," the memo says, going on to say the authors shouldn’t have included C. difficile deaths in their analysis. Summing up, the memo says "the idea that widespread use of reusable bags may cause gastrointestinal infections if they are not regularly cleaned is plausible. However, the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and deaths due to reusable bags has not been tested, much less demonstrated in this study. It would be a disservice to San Francisco residents and visitors to alarm them by claiming that it has been. It could be useful, however, to remind people to use safe food-handling practices, including maintaining the cleanliness of everything they use to transport, handle, and prepare food." We asked San Francisco County if there had been any response by the professors to the county’s memo. Nancy Sarieh of the public health department told us by email: "They did respond. We agreed to disagree and they have not updated their paper." In February 2013, we otherwise noticed, commentator Debra J. Saunders of the San Francisco Chronicle quoted Klick saying he cannot "rule out the possibility that there was something peculiar that happened in San Francisco." A Texas expert Separately, we asked Dr. Philip Huang, the medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, to take a look at the paper posted by Penn plus the San Francisco County memo. Huang said by phone that the Penn paper, limited to ER admissions, missed the fact that individuals who take sick from food are treated by private doctors or don’t even seek health care. Notably too, Huang said, the researchers failed to consider the health surveillance data later cited by the county. "I mean, who knows? You can get a spike" in illness "and there could have been something else going on in the community that is totally unrelated," Huang said. "I think the people who are closest to the data in their own community would have the best perspective." From ER admissions alone, Huang said, "certainly the data is not there to make any conclusions about this." Foundation notes other accounts Next, we circled back to Espinosa, the foundation spokeswoman, about the memo disputing the professors’ analysis and Huang’s comments. By email, Espinosa pointed out a 2011 peer-reviewed study, partly supported by the American Chemistry Council, finding that among reusable bags randomly collected from consumers entering grocery stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and Tucson, E. coli were identified in 8 percent of bags plus a "wide range of enteric bacteria," according to the authors including Charles P. Gerba of the University of Arizona. "When meat juices were added to bags and stored in the trunks of cars for two hours, the number of bacteria increased 10-fold, indicating the potential for bacterial growth in the bags," the authors wrote. "Hand or machine washing was found to reduce the bacteria in bags by > 99.9%. These results indicate that reusable bags, if not properly washed on a regular basis, can play a role in the cross-contamination of foods. " Espinosa also noted a May 2012 Los Angeles Times news story describing an Oregon outbreak affecting nine soccer players who had come in contact with a reused grocery bag. The story said one of the girls got sick shortly after arrival, from a norovirus she presumably acquired prior to the trip, Dr. Kimberly K. Repp of the Oregon Health and Science University and Dr. William E. Keene of the Oregon Public Health Division reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. "The sick girl was then isolated in the room of one of the chaperones," the Times reported. "Nonetheless, eight other girls became ill. The investigation showed that the virus was found on a reusable grocery bag that had been used to store snacks for the team. It had, unfortunately, been stored in the bathroom," the story said. When the sick girl used the bathroom, the norovirus was aerosolized and deposited on the bag, where it was later transferred to other girls when they got snacks. Our ruling Quintero said that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, "you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses" spike. This declaration relied on a study that took a correlation between ER cases and San Francisco’s phased-in bag ban to declare ties between the reported illnesses and the ban. However, the county raised serious questions about the study methodology and conclusions, which were overly simplistic. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-06369	Under a law proposed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, businesses that move into Wisconsin "don't have to pay any taxes" on their income for two years.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/03/mahlon-mitchell/potential-recall-candidate-says-walker-gave-compan/	A trailblazing African-American union leader has captured the imagination of liberals as a potential challenger to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, should the Republican governor be forced into a recall election in 2012. Mahlon Mitchell, a Madison Fire Department lieutenant who has never run for political office, has emerged as a possible Democratic candidate. In late October 2011, a movement to draft him surfaced on the Internet and Mitchell said he would consider running against Walker. In January 2011, Mitchell, then 33, became the youngest person and the first African-American elected president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union. Mitchell was soon sought out by the national media as a critic of Walker’s collective bargaining changes, which prompted weeks of demonstrations in Madison but exempted Mitchell's members. He has been giving speeches at union rallies and other events around the country. On Oct. 4, 2011, Mitchell repeated his criticisms of Walker at a Washington, D.C., conference called Take Back the American Dream, which was described in one news report as an attempt to "re-energize disenchanted liberals." "Let me tell you what the governor did in January" before introducing the bill that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public employees, Mitchell said. "Any business that comes into the state of Wisconsin from Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota -- two years you don't have to pay any taxes on your income." Much has happened since Walker made his first legislative moves shortly after taking office in January -- the demonstrations, recall elections of state senators and preparations for the expected launch on Nov. 15, 2011, of the effort to recall Walker. So, did the governor really grant companies that move to Wisconsin two years of tax freedom? Mitchell cited Assembly Bill 3, one of the measures introduced in a special legislative session called by Walker in January. It allows a business that moves to Wisconsin to claim a tax deduction for two consecutive years, according to a memo from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, which provides legal and other research services to the Legislature. A memo from Walker’s budget office makes it clear the deduction is equal to the amount of income taxes owed. It is not known, of course, how many companies will take advantage of the deduction, but the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that without such a law, the state would collect $500,000 more per year in taxes. Walker promoted the measure as one way to create more jobs in Wisconsin. The bill was approved 82-12 by the Assembly and 24-9 by the Senate, with a total of 29 Democrats voting yes. It was signed into law by Walker on Jan. 31, 2011. Our conclusion Mitchell said that because of actions taken by Walker, businesses moving to Wisconsin "don't have to pay any (income) taxes" for two years. Walker backed and signed a law that offers such a tax deduction. We rate Mitchell’s statement True.

pomt-10584	Mitt Romney wants "to set a date for withdrawal" from Iraq.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/31/john-mccain/romney-wont-mention-a-date/	On the weekend before the Florida Republican primary, John McCain attacked Mitt Romney on Iraq, bringing one of McCain's signature issues back to the forefront of the campaign. "Now, one of my opponents wanted to set a date for withdrawal that would have meant disaster," McCain said. Later, in remarks to reporters, McCain linked Romney's position with that of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. "If we surrender and wave a white flag, like Senator Clinton wants to do, and withdraw, as Governor Romney wanted to do, then there will be chaos, genocide, and the cost of American blood and treasure would be dramatically higher," McCain said. (We previously examined McCain's "white flag" attack on Hillary Clinton here .) Romney immediately disputed the accuracy of McCain's remarks. "That's dishonest, to say that I have a specific date. That's simply wrong," Romney said. "That is not the case. I've never said that." So did he? As a source, the McCain campaign points to an interview Romney gave to Good Morning America in April 2007. Interviewer Robin Roberts asked Romney, "Do you believe that there should be a timetable in withdrawing the troops?" Romney: "Well, there's no question but that the president and Prime Minister al-Maliki have to have a series of timetables and milestones that they speak about. But those shouldn't be for public pronouncement. You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have to wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone. You want to have a series of things you want to see accomplished in terms of the strength of the Iraqi military and the Iraqi police and the leadership of the Iraqi government." Roberts: "So, private? You wouldn't do it publicly because — the president has said flat-out that he will veto anything the Congress passes about a timetable for troop withdrawals. As president, would you do the same?" Romney: "Well, could you, yeah — well, of course. Could you imagine the setting where during the Second World War we said to the Germans, gee, if we haven't reached the Rhine by this date, we'll go home, or if we haven't gotten this accomplished, we'll pull up and leave? You don't publish that to your enemy, or they just simply lie and wait until that time. So, of course, you have to work together to create timetables and milestones, but you don't do that with the opposition." So is a withdrawal date a withdrawal date if you don't tell anyone about it? On the Democratic side of the presidential campaign, where primary voters are generally opposed to the Iraq war, the candidates regularly discuss timelines for withdrawal. Their emphasis has been on when to begin withdrawal, with front-runners Clinton and Barack Obama resisting deadlines for complete withdrawal. It's worth noting that Romney hasn't come close to talking about the kind of withdrawal parameters the Democrats have mentioned. On the other hand, he's said in debates that he does not envision a permanent presence for the United States in Iraq. In a September debate, Romney said: "If the surge is working, then we're going to be able to start bringing back our troop levels, slowly but surely, and play more of a support role over time. Ultimately, down the road, I would anticipate that we're not going to have a permanent presence in Iraq." McCain has said that while high casualty levels over the long term in Iraq are unacceptable to the American public, troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed, comparing the situation with American troops in Japan and Germany. (We checked an attack on McCain about that statement here .) So McCain and Romney do seem to have genuine policy differences when it comes to withdrawal. But McCain paraphrases Romney's statements in a way that leaves voters with the impression that Romney advocates a specific date for withdrawal from Iraq, which he does not. When Romney spoke about setting timetables for troop withdrawal it was within the context of meeting benchmarks or goals for progress there. For that reason, we come down on the more negative side of the Truth-O-Meter's dial. We rate McCain's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-01-31T00:00:00	2008-01-26	['Iraq']

pomt-02227	"We know that Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/17/michael-eric-dyson/dyson-conservative-white-men-dominate-sunday-talk-/	Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder sparked a bit of controversy when he spoke at the annual convention of the National Action Network, a civil rights group formed by Rev. Al Sharpton. Holder’s prepared speech spotlighted what his department had done in areas that would loom large for his predominantly African-American audience. He talked about voting rights, prosecuting hate crimes and ensuring better legal counsel for defendants unable to afford a lawyer. But at one moment, Holder strayed from the script. A line that was supposed to lead into the Supreme Court’s rejection of a key voting rights tool turned into a rebuke of the Republican Congress. "The last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity," Holder said. "If you don’t believe that, you look at the way — forget about me, forget about me. You look at the way the attorney general of the United States was treated yesterday by a House committee — has nothing to do with me, forget that. What attorney general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment? What president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?" While Holder never mentioned race, the punditocracy concluded that Holder was saying that he and President Barack Obama are subject to greater disrespect because they are black. On Fox News Sunday, Brit Hume said he suspected that Holder was invoking race, and unfairly so. "This strikes me as kind of cry baby stuff from Holder," Hume said. "My sense of that this is that both Eric Holder and Barack Obama have benefited politically enormously from the fact that they are African-American and the first to hold the jobs that they hold." Hume and his fellow panelist George Will said other presidents and attorneys general have suffered worse treatment on Capitol Hill. Those comments drew further response the next day on MSNBC’s The Ed Show. Host Ed Schultz asked Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson what he thought of the cry baby label. Dyson, himself African-American, rejected it and took his own dig at the Fox News panel, which was made up of three white men and one white woman. "We know that Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men who carp and complain to no end about the inability to get access (to power) when they have it," Dyson said. We can’t fact-check the carping and complaining line, but we can drill down on Dyson’s claim that "Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men." Since the start of the year, PunditFact has been tracking guests who have appeared on the five most prominent Sunday news shows -- Fox News Sunday, Face the Nation, Meet the Press, This Week and State of the Union. So far we’ve logged 600 different guests, and categorized them by job, political leaning, race and gender. On politics, we created three categories -- conservative, liberal and "other" (a catch-all category). We, if we might say, took a conservative approach and when we had any doubts, used the "other" category liberally. Our tally does not include hosts or interviewers but does include all panelists. So when Jonathan Karl fills in as host on This Week, he would not count. But when Karl appears on ABC's weekly rountable, he would. Eventually we plan on building a guest tracker that will allow you to see who appears most often on the Sunday news shows. But for now we can use the data we have collected to analyze Dyson’s claim. What we found Again, Dyson is claiming that the typical Sunday morning show crowd consists of "conservative white men." He’s certainly right that most guests are white men. They account for two-thirds of all the people invited to the Sunday talk fests. Men, regardless of ethnic background or job, make up 75 percent of all guests. Whites, both male and female, make up 85 percent of all guests. But Dyson steers off course by adding the qualifier "conservative," our data shows. Conservatives -- regardless of gender or race -- make up about 32 percent of the guests while liberals make up 26 percent. The remaining guests, about 42 percent, are neither conservative nor liberal -- a broad group that includes journalists and technical experts. (Think Judy Woodruff and lots of people talking about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.) The number of conservatives shrink when isolate on "conservative white men." The group of white conservative men claims about 25 percent of all appearances on the Sunday talk shows in 2014. Clearly, that’s not a majority. It's not even a plurality. The most likely group to appear on the Sunday shows is other or neutral white males. They make up 27 percent of all guests so far in 2014. We also decided to look just at pundits. Of that group, the percentage of conservative white male pundits is actually smaller, our database shows. Since the start of the year, 410 pundits have appeared on the Sunday shows. Of that group, about 20 percent were "conservative white men." That’s more than liberal white men, who made up 8 percent of pundits. But not nearly as much as neutral white male pundits -- who made up about 35 percent of all appearances. We reached out to Dyson to get his numbers and we haven’t heard back. What we can say is from our database of the Sunday talk shows is that conservatives are outnumbering liberals, but conservative white males don’t hold dominion. It’s people who don’t fall into any particular political category that represent the largest single group. Now, we're not the only group that tracks the Sunday show guests list. The liberal group Media Matters released findings from a review of the 2013 network Sunday shows (our list, except for CNN's State of the Union). According to their methodology, conservative white males made up 29 percent of all guests in 2013, more than the next biggest group, neutral white males, who accounted for 23 percent of all guests. Conservative white males made up the largest percentage for any one group, Media Matters said, but still accounted for just three in 10 guests. Our ruling Dyson said the the Sunday talk shows are usually given over to conservative white men. It would have been much more accurate if he just said white men. According to the liberal group Media Matters, conservative white males made up 29 percent of the guests when looking at four Sunday shows. That's the largest of any group when breaking things down for ideology, race and gender, Media Matters found. Our database for 2014 presents different findings. So far, 25 percent of all appearances on the Sunday talk shows in 2014 have been made by conservative white men. That's slightly less than neutral or "other" white men who made up 27 percent of all guest appearances so far in 2014. Dyson described the Sunday shows as having been "given over" to conservative white males. While that phrase isn't exact, it does suggest a dominant presence. The numbers don’t back that up. Conservatives outman the liberals but by the time you drill down to white, male, conservatives, they lose much of the edge. Dyson pushed too far on his adjectives. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02510	Girl Scouts USA’s curriculum "promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate."	false	/texas/statements/2014/feb/13/american-life-league/cookie-hawking-girl-scouts-not-teaching-girls-emul/	Think twice about buying Girl Scout cookies, a national group urges, because participating girls are taught to admire "pro-abortion women." A reader told us she fielded a Feb. 4, 2014, email blast with that message signed by Judie Brown, president of the Virginia-based American Life League. One of the blast’s claims: The Girl Scouts of the USA "curriculum now promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate." According to a biographical sketch posted online by Harvard University, Sanger was a nurse and lecturer who opened the country’s first birth-control clinic and later founded the American Birth Control League (which was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942). Friedan, according to another Harvard web page, famously authored "The Feminine Mystique," published in 1963, which "fueled the controversy over women's proper place in society and had a dramatic impact on women in the United States and abroad. Friedan quickly became the leading advocate for change in the status of women." In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women (NOW), a civil rights organization for women, serving as its first president, according to the web page, and later was vice president of the National Association to Repeal Abortion Laws and also on a Girl Scouts USA board. By telephone and email, Paul Rondeau, the league’s executive director, credited a former Girl Scouts troop leader, Christy Volanski, with the research behind the claim. The league calls itself the largest grass-roots Catholic pro-life organization in the nation. Let’s take the Girl Scouts’ "promotion" of Sanger and Friedan one by one. Margaret Sanger Rondeau told us that after the group sent its email blast, Volanski made it clear that the Girl Scouts’ "promotion" of Sanger was not directly in the scouts’ curriculum; instead, that occurred via social media. Volanski, of Spring, Texas, guided us to the Pinterest page for Girl Scout Cadettes, meaning scouts in grades six through eight, includes a link to a May 17, 2013, entry on"The Eloquent Woman" blog created by Denise Graveline, a public speaking coach and communications consultant based in Washington, D.C. The blog entry lists 13 speeches on human rights by women including Sojourner Truth, Clara Barton, Margaret Chase Smith, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lady Gaga, Betty Friedan and Sally Field. The Sanger entry says: "Women's rights to birth control were Margaret Sanger's campaign in the 1920s, and for her efforts to speak out on this issue, she was arrested and ignored and fought. Her focus was the children born ‘unwelcome, unwanted, unprepared for, unknown,’ a stirring bit of alliteration." That entry links to another web page describing and excerpting a speech by Sanger in 1925 on the results of overpopulation and a lack of birth-control options. A web link leads to the full March 30, 1925, speech, posted on an Iowa State University website, in which Sanger argued for women to be free from "enforced, enslaved maternity. There can be no hope for the future of civilization, no certainty of racial salvation," she said, "until every woman can decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother, and when and how many children she cares to bring into the world." We saw no mention of abortion on the Sanger web pages. Betty Friedan Friedan appears in the Girl Scouts’ curriculum, Volanski told us, as one of the exemplary women described in bottom-of-the-page blurbs in "Your Voice, Your World, The Power of Advocacy," a 2008 guide for older scouts interested in learning about how to make a case for change. The guide, which we obtained from Austin-based Girl Scouts of Central Texas, has more than 50 of the "Voices for Good" blurbs, each one about specific women and their actions/achievements in the years from 1792 through 2007. Two blurbs mention Friedan, neither one touching on abortion or her involvement in starting the abortion rights action league. In 1963, the guide says, Friedan published "The Feminine Mystique," "attacking the belief that homemaking and childbearing are the only ways for women to find satisfaction in their lives. She postulates that a system requiring women to find their identity solely as wives and mothers stunts them. The book galvanizes the women’s movement." In 1966, the guide says, Friedan and Pauli Murray, the first black woman Episcopal priest, wrote the mission statement for the National Organization for Women, with a declared purpose of women gaining full participation in American society in "true equal partnership with men." Today, the guide says, the group’s priorities include an end to violence against women. Other women described in the blurbs include prominent figures in the Democratic Party, which has championed abortion rights. The women include Texan Barbara Jordan, the first woman to keynote the Democrats’ national convention; Geraldine Ferrraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee; Hillary Clinton, singled out for seeking health care reform in 1993; and Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress. Other women blurbed in the guide include Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court; Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979; civil rights icon Rosa Parks; Eleanor Roosevelt; Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a union organizer who helped launch the American Civil Liberties Union in 1920; and Dolores Huerta, co-founder in 1962 of what became the United Farm Workers and an organizer for women’s equality and other causes. We spotted no mentions of abortion or birth control in the 103-page guide. By phone, we asked Volanski if the women touted in the guide represent a mix of Americans. "They do have a couple of conservative ladies in there," Volanski said, mentioning Mother Teresa. "I’d say it’s wide-ranging," she said, yet more of the chosen women are "left-leaning," making the mix unbalanced, she said. Girls Scouts respond On a "What We Stand For" web page, the Girl Scouts of the USA says: "The Girl Scout organization does not take a position on abortion or birth control. We believe this is a private matter for girls and their families." By phone, Kelly Parisi, spokeswoman for the New York-based Girl Scouts, said the scouts’ curriculum does not depict Sanger, Friedan and other women as pro-abortion icons. Parisi noted that the entry on the Pinterest page created for scout Cadettes points to a web page listing speeches by 13 women; that is, it doesn’t promote Sanger alone. Also, Parisi said, the Friedan blurbs in the scouts’ guide state only that she wrote her book and helped found NOW, Parisi said, not delving into her position on abortion access. "You cannot talk about women’s history in this country without mentioning Betty Friedan," Parisi said. Asked about Volanski’s suggestion that the mix of listed advocates is unbalanced, Parisi replied: "We’re not trying to be balanced because we’re not trying to promote a political agenda. We don’t vet these women based on their political beliefs." "We are a nonpartisan, nonpolitical organization," Parisi said. Rondeau, by email, said our sampling of the blurbs in the guide (which we’d shared with him) demonstrates its pro-abortion slant in that all but two of the women whose blurbs we noted had shown such a lean, while only Mother Teresa clearly believed otherwise. "The pattern seems quite clear," Rondeau wrote. Our ruling The league said Girl Scouts USA’s curriculum "promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate." A Girl Scouts’ Pinterest page--not the scouts’ curriculum--leads to a blog post highlighting speeches by 13 women, including one by Sanger. The scouts' advocacy guide, part of the organization’s curriculum, features two blurbs on Friedan and also thumbnails other women who have advocated abortion rights. However, none of the guide's 50-some biographical blurbs mentions any woman's activism per abortion as a reason for singling her out. Abortion is not mentioned elsewhere in the guide, either. We find no factual reason to conclude that the scouts are teaching girls in this vein. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-03839	"Our debt is already bigger than our economy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/15/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-nations-debt-bigger-economy/	Paul Ryan told a boisterous CPAC crowd that without action on the budget, "the debt will weigh down our country like an anchor." Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman and former Republican vice presidential candidate, rose to prominence for budget proposals that dramatically cut spending and made structural changes to Medicare to achieve more savings. This week, Ryan released the 2014 version, which follows much the same blueprint -- and makes the same dire warnings about the nation’s debt. "Our debt is already bigger than our economy," he said at CPAC on March 15, 2013. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas checked out a similar claim from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Here, we’ll take a fresh look. GDP vs. which kind of debt? Ryan’s office pointed us to two sources of government figures. First, the easy one. The Bureau of Economic Analysis’ put out a press release on February 28, 2013 putting GDP at just over $15.8 trillion. The government defines the GDP -- gross domestic product -- as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country. As for the debt, the U.S. Treasury is the go-to source. As of March 14, 2013, total outstanding public debt is $16,708,225,460,175.14. (We’ll call it $16.7 trillion for everyone’s sanity.) That’s broken down into two categories: debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. Here are those dollar figures: Debt held by the public: $11.9 trillion Intragovernmental holdings: $4.8 trillion To explain the difference, we’ll borrow from our PolitiFact Texas colleagues’ handiwork. Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. "If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market." Paul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, further explained why that matters. "Debt held by the public is important because it reflects the extent to which the government goes into private credit markets to borrow. Such borrowing draws on private national saving and international saving and therefore competes with investment in the nongovernmental sector (for factories and equipment, research and development, housing, and so forth). Large increases in such borrowing can also push up interest rates and increase the future interest payments the federal government must make to foreign lenders, which reduces Americans’ income. Achieving a stable debt-to-GDP ratio is a key test of fiscal sustainability," Van de Water wrote in a memo. So, if we just consider debt held by the public -- which is what most affects the economy -- it totals about 75 percent of GDP -- not, as Ryan said, more than the size of the economy. But Ryan isn’t entirely off-base, especially since partisans tend to disagree about the importance of intragovernmental holdings. "When you dig a bit deeper, you hit a partisan debate about the portion of the debt not held by the public, most of which is held by the government in trust funds. Republicans say that the trust funds are filled with IOUs, which eventually will have to be redeemed with other funds. Democrats say that the trust funds represent binding promises that government has made to tens of millions of Americans. They’re both right," said William Galston, an expert with the Brookings Institution who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton. "What Ryan said is not untrue, although it’s not the only way of describing the truth." Our ruling Ryan claimed that "our debt is already bigger than our economy." If you count debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, the debt is roughly 105 percent of the economy. But counting only debt held by the public, which is what many economists say affects the wider economy and credit markets, the debt is only 75 percent of GDP. Debt held by the public is more relevant to discussions about federal spending, but it’s not the one Ryan cited. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01908	"Congressman (Tom) Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/01/senate-majority-pac/did-arkansas-rep-tom-cotton-vote-against-disaster-/	Democrats are attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., for his voting record on an important Tornado Alley issue. A television ad produced by the liberal Senate Majority PAC shows video footage of tornadoes and a storm-ravaged town. The narrator, a firefighter identified as Matthew from Little Rock, goes on to criticize Cotton, who is running for Senate, for voting against disaster relief. "I'll never understand why Congressman Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times, against recovery for victims of natural disasters. He's detached himself from what's going on in Arkansas," he said. The federal government most recently declared a disaster in Arkansas this past April, when a tornado killed 16 people -- the deadliest tornado in the state since 1968. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent about $5 million on disaster relief there, without having to seek Congressional approval. Cotton, who is running against incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor, has been in Congress for less than two years -- has he voted against disaster relief five times? Senate Majority PAC spokesman Ty Matsdorf pointed us to the five times they found Cotton had voted against disaster relief since he took office in January 2013. Four out of the five have to do with funding Hurricane Sandy relief (three of those were all on one bill). The votes are: Vote 1: H.R. 41, January 2013 Cotton voted against a measure to temporarily increase FEMA's borrowing authority in order to carry out the National Flood Insurance Program in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 354-67 and became law. Vote 2: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against an amendment that proposed $17 billion in emergency funding to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 327-91. Vote 3: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against an amendment that proposed $33.7 billion for immediate and anticipated needs in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 228-192. Vote 4: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against the final bill that would give $50 billion in disaster relief aid to communities and FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 241 and 180 and became law. Vote 5: H.R. 3547, January 2014 Cotton voted against this omnibus appropriations bill that appropriated money to the Disaster Relief Fund. The bill passed the House 359 to 67 and became law. Of Arkansas’ four Republican representatives, Cotton is the only one to have voted "no" on all five of those measures. But two of them -- Timothy Griffin and and Steve Womack -- voted "no" on final passage for the final Hurricane Sandy funding bill, while Rick Crawford voted "no' on H.R. 3547, the omnibus appropriations bill. In the Senate, H.R. 41 passed with a voice vote, where the votes aren’t tallied. Pryor approved both of the other two bills. Republican Sen. John Boozman, however, voted "no" on H.R. 152, the Hurricane Sandy bill. We should note that none of these votes involved specific disaster relief for Arkansas. However, H.R. 3547 was a general appropriations bill covering many areas, a small part of which had to do with funding general disaster relief. And H.R. 152 included $16 billion for community development in declared disaster areas across the country. Cotton’s office didn't respond to our questions, but a post on his campaign website defends his disaster relief record regarding Hurricane Sandy. "Unfortunately, Washington politicians took advantage of a tragic situation and loaded down the Sandy relief bill with billions in spending that didn’t help the victims but instead went to fund the pet causes of Congressmen," it says. At the time, some conservatives criticized H.R. 152, the final Hurricane Sandy aid bill, for including funds that didn’t go to immediate disaster relief. According to a Congressional Quarterly analysis, $17 billion went to immediate aid, and $33.5 billion went to long-term assistance. The budget group Taxpayers for Common Sense documented some of the side projects Cotton and his colleagues were trying to trim out of the bill, such as $2 million for Smithsonian museum roof repairs and $118 million on Amtrak upgrades. And Cotton’s votes on H.R. 152 weren’t all negative. For example, he voted "yes" on at least five (failed) amendments that cut funds in other areas in order to account for the additional spending on disaster relief. He also voted "yes" on a later bill that expanded the type of nonprofit organization that could provide disaster aid and assistance. In reviewing Cotton’s votes, we found Cotton has tended to side with tea party members of the House looking to rein in government spending at any cost. For example, he was part of the coalition that supported shutting down the federal government over raising the debt ceiling. Cotton has been "unusually steadfast in his opposition to spending," said Janine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas. "The main undertone I hear when the Pryor allies run an ad like that is another effort to paint (Cotton) as outside the mainstream, even extremist," Parry said. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC ad said, "Congressman Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times." We found that Cotton voted against five bills or amendments that would have gone to immediate aid or funded disaster relief programs. The rest of the Arkansas delegation only voted "no" on some of them. However, the ad is a bit disengenuous because it really only addresses three disaster relief bills, and a couple of other Arkansan delegates voted against final passage. The ad also leaves out the times that Cotton voted for disaster relief funding, as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it. Overall, Cotton typically doesn’t support spending that isn’t balanced out with cuts in other areas. Additionally, if you think this ad -- which shows tornado-ravaged areas -- is talking all about Arkansas, that isn't the case. Most of these votes had to do with Hurricane Sandy. We rate this claim Half True. UPDATE, July 9, 2014: In a response ad, Cotton listed three votes that showed his support for disaster-relief funding. We rated that ad Half True.

pomt-00282	California "is hemorrhaging population."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/sep/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-misleading-claim-california-hemorrhaging/	Politicians from California and Texas tend to tussle over which state is producing more jobs, or sometimes poaching them, as well as whose economy is growing faster. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz added fuel to the long-running fight when he claimed California "is hemorrhaging population" in a recent Senate debate with his Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O’Rourke. Cruz argued O’Rourke offers Texas a future with higher taxes similar to California. "There are also states that implement the kind of policies that Congressman O’Rourke supports, high taxes, high regulations, open borders, states--you look at California, which is hemorrhaging population. You know the cost of a one-way U-haul from California to Texas is more than 300% the cost the other way around." Sen. Cruz make his claim in the video above. In 2014, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas fact-checked the claim that U-hauls from California to Texas are more expensive. In 2014, they found they cost twice as much as ones headed in the reverse direction. For this fact check, we focused on Cruz’s claim about California’s population -- a statement brought to our attention on Twitter by applied demographer Jeffrey Wright. We agreed with Wright that it was time for a fact check. Our research Asked about the claim, Cruz’s campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed to several news and government reports on Californians leaving for other states. The evidence for that is clear. We explored it in a recent fact check on Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox when he made an exaggerated claim that "half the people" in California want to leave. We reported that California’s once-rapid population growth has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in from the rest of the country for many years, according to a February 2018 study by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. About five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the American Community Survey. Here’s who’s moving from and to California, according to the report: "Families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states (Texas, Arizona, and Nevada). College-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California from its top feeder states (New York, Illinois, and New Jersey)." But we also found the gap between the number of Californians who left for other states and those who arrived from the rest of the country has narrowed considerably. That gap was several hundred thousand people per year in the 1990s and mid 2000s, but dropped to a few thousand per year during the Great Recession, before again increasing. Still, that’s hardly a "hemorrhaging," especially considering this is only a subset of the state’s overall population. SOURCE: Feburary 2018 report, California Legislative Analyst’s Office Overall population continues to grow The migration to other states does not mean California’s overall population is in decline. Just the opposite: It’s grown by an average 333,000 people per year since 2010 largely due to natural births and international migration, according to the California Department of Finance. California was home to 39.8 million people as of January 2018, according to the finance department. That included an increase of 309,000 residents in 2017 alone and nearly 2.3 million over seven years. Our ruling Sen. Ted Cruz claimed California "is hemorrhaging population" in a recent debate. In reality, California’s population has grown by an average of 333,000 per year since 2010 due to natural births and international migration. There’s a sliver of truth in Cruz’s statement: The state for many years has lost more people to other states -- including Texas -- than it’s gained from the rest of the country. But even that interpretation of the claim doesn’t show a "hemorrhaging." The gap between Californians leaving for other states and those arriving from the rest of the country narrowed considerably over the past decade. In the end, the senator ignored key facts that would give a different impression. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-14361	"70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/22/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-about-how-many-americans-think-cou/	In national politics, it seems as if everything is up for grabs these days. There’s the presidential election, with an open seat at stake. Control of Congress is in the balance. And there is a critical vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Appearing Feb. 22, 2016 on Megyn Kelly’s Fox News show, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), said the problem is head-butting between the Republican-controlled Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama. "We have this liberal president and conservative congress" Ryan said, punching his fists together. "It’s not working." "So you don’t think anything can get done unless it’s one party rule?" Kelly asked. "Look at the path we are on," Ryan replied. "70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path." To be sure, in a politically divided country, Republicans may think we are on the wrong path because of what Democrats are doing, and vice versa. But that still seems like a high percentage of Americans thinking the country is headed in the wrong direction. Is Ryan right? Digging in When we asked for backup, Ryan’s team pointed to the most recent Associated Press poll before Ryan’s appearance the show, conducted between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. The AP-GfK poll is conducted online using a nationally representative sample of American adults recruited to take surveys. While the poll was conducted online, participants were found through address-based sampling to include people who do not have internet access. The question about the country’s direction is asked first on the AP poll. This means previous questions don’t influence the response. Of the Americans polled in February, 68 percent said things in this country are generally heading in the wrong direction. That’s just under Ryan’s 70 percent figure. The number was actually down from 74 percent in the previous poll, taken in December 2015. And for some time people have thought the country is headed in the wrong direction. For the last two years, 60 percent or more of those polled by AP-GfK have said the country is heading in the wrong direction. Here’s a look at those numbers. Date of poll Wrong direction percentage Feb. 11-15, 2016 68 Dec. 3-7, 2015 74 Oct. 15-19, 2015 63 July 9-13, 2015 64 April 23-27, 2015 62 Jan. 29 - Feb. 2, 2015 60 Dec. 4-8, 2014 66 July 24-28, 2014 72 May 16-19, 2014 62 Interestingly, the bleak outlook from respondents for the country doesn’t seem to affect the outlook for their own families. In the same poll, 76 percent of respondents said things for their family were generally headed in the right direction. But Ryan’s staff cited a single poll. The right direction-wrong direction is a common one in polling, so for comparison we took a look at Huffington Post Pollster. The feature compiles the reliable polls and tracks that data. Pollster’s Feb. 17, 2016 analysis found 64 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. The data shows that percentage has been hovering around 64 percent since October of 2015 and hasn’t risen above 65 percent since 2012. By this measure, the only time 70 percent of Americans said the country was on the wrong track was in October 2011. Our rating Ryan said "70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path." His team backed up this statement with reliable poll results from the Associated Press. But many other polls reported a lower number, closer to 60 percent. What’s more, the percent of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track has hovered above 60 percent for the last three years. This statement is accurate but needs additional information or context. That’s our definition of Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-03-22T05:00:00	2016-02-22	['United_States']
pomt-14419	In 2006, Bernie Sanders "voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-supported-minu/	Immigration policy was a big topic at the Univision-Washington Post Democratic presidential debate in Miami. On several occasions, Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to attack Bernie Sanders’ record on immigration. At one point, she said, "In 2006, when Sen. Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants." She later repeated both parts of this charge. Sanders took issue with Clinton’s statements during the debate. Responding to a question from moderator Jorge Ramos about whether he supported the Minutemen, Sanders said, "Of course not. There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation. What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it." Many readers asked us to take a closer look, so we did. We’ll take the two parts of Clinton’s statement in order. Sanders voted for 'indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants' The legislation in question is the Community Protection Act of 2006, which passed the House on Sept. 21, 2006, but died in the Senate. Sanders did vote for the bill, along with almost all Republicans and a majority of the House Democratic caucus. (Then, as now, Sanders in Congress identifies himself as an independent.) By backing it, Sanders went against the urgings of the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Council of La Raza, a prominent Hispanic group. So what did the bill do? According to the Congressional Research Service’s official summary of the bill, it would, among other things, "permit indefinite detention of specified dangerous aliens under orders of removal who cannot be removed, subject to review every six months." The bill itself says, "With regard to length of detention, an alien may be detained under this section, without limitation, until the alien is subject to an administratively final order of removal." The ACLU, in arguing against passage, said the bill "would broaden the constitutionally dubious practice of indefinite detention. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that indefinite detention raises constitutional concerns, yet the bill unwisely expands that power." The ACLU went on to call the indefinite detention "inhumane, an enormous waste of scarce detention resources and a power expected of repressive regimes, not of our own." Even though the bill itself does not use the precise words "indefinite detention," the fact that the Congressional Research Service uses it gives Clinton solid support for using that descriptor. That said, Clinton’s phrasing leaves out a few nuances. Hearing this statement, one might assume the power was a direct threat to a broad swath of the undocumented immigrant population. In reality, the types of undocumented immigrants who would be affected by this provision are a specific, smaller subset -- those who are deportable, often due to having a criminal record, but who are awaiting a final legal decision. For a sense of scale, the ACLU in 2009 cited an Associated Press report that on Jan. 25, 2009, there were at least 4,170 individuals in detention for six months or longer, with 1,334 of those subjected to detention for one year or more. These are not small numbers, but it’s worth remembering that the best estimate for the total number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is around 11 million. (Clinton did, later in the debate, refer to Sanders voting for "indefinite detention for people facing deportation," which is a more limited universe of people.) Clinton also didn’t mention that the bill would have required reviews of the detention status every six months. This isn’t a foolproof system -- many such immigrants, for instance, don’t have attorneys -- but it does indicate that the bill included requirements for due process. Finally, it’s misleading to say, as Clinton did, that supporters were primarily "hard-line Republicans." A number of liberal Democrats also supported the bill, including such prominent lawmakers as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and future Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. In a response released by the Sanders campaign during the debate, the campaign said that his support stemmed from a different part of the bill that dealt with gang members. "Bernie Sanders believes that gang members who committed serious crimes should be deported and voted for legislation that, while overly broad, would do just that," the statement said. In general, though, Clinton has a point that Sanders supported a bill that includes indefinite detention. Sanders voted 'to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen' Both campaigns acknowledge that this refers to a 2006 amendment -- which Sanders voted for -- to a large Homeland Security appropriations bill. It was designed to bar the Department of Homeland Security from providing "a foreign government information relating to the activities of an organized volunteer civilian action group, operating in the State of California, Texas, New Mexico, or Arizona." What’s that all about? The Minutemen were a group of civilians who patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to stop people from crossing into the United States illegally. (We won’t take a position on whether they were "vigilantes," as Clinton called them, since that’s a matter of opinion.) In December, the website BuzzFeed took a look at this largely forgotten episode and found a lot of fuzzy memories -- even by the lawmaker who sponsored the amendment and other Republicans sympathetic to the Minutemen. According to BuzzFeed, this dates back to a period before the 2006 midterm elections when "an outcry raged in the fringier corners of the immigration debate" that the U.S. government was quietly providing the Mexican government with intelligence about Minutemen patrols. When these concerns reached the halls of Congress, then-Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., introduced an amendment to ease the Minutemen’s concerns." The article quoted Harel Shapira, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin and author of a 2013 book on the Minutemen, saying the debate was steeped in conspiracy theories. A statement on a Mexican government website "was interpreted by Minutemen and supporters as the U.S. government collaborating with an enemy state, and putting the lives of patriotic Americans at risk," Shapira said. (We did not hear back from Shapira ourselves.) Responding during the debate, Sanders assailed Clinton’s effort to link him to the Minutemen, a group unpopular among many Democrats. "No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make," Sanders said. Still, the Sanders campaign hasn’t given a good explanation about why he affirmatively supported the amendment. Instead, they have focused on making the argument that the amendment was moot, and thus harmless. "People put forward nuisance amendments all the time," Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman told BuzzFeed last December. "In this case, the Customs and Border Patrol said it was a meaningless thing." The campaign cites comments by then-Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., who was the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee. "I claim the time in opposition; but, Mr. Chairman, I don’t rise in opposition," he said on the floor, citing comments by customs officials that they already followed the policy outlined in the amendment. "If people want to put it in the bill, I guess that is okay because it apparently does nothing," he said. Still, as with Clinton’s charge about indefinite detention, her statement about Sanders supporting an amendment favorable to the Minutemen is largely accurate. The one problem with Clinton’s statement is that she exaggerated the extent to which the measure was backed mainly by hard-line Republicans. The amendment did pass the House with almost universal Republican support, but it did attract a significant minority of the Democratic caucus -- 76 voted for it, while 106 voted against. Our ruling Clinton said that in 2006, Bernie Sanders "voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants." Clinton may have boiled down the substance of the measures a bit too much, but her accounting is largely accurate -- importantly, in her claim that Sanders voted for both measures. That said, Clinton glosses over the degree to which Democrats -- and not just Republicans -- supported both measures. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-14219	Says Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio "had it set so that the winner takes everything, because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything" in the Florida primary.	false	/florida/statements/2016/apr/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-marco-rubio-and-jeb-bush-had-flo/	Donald Trump has been on a tear accusing the Republican establishment of rigging the system to hurt him, despite the fact that he leads the delegate count in the primaries. One of the states where leaders are out to get him is Florida, he says. The state’s March 15 primary was "winner-take-all," which means all of the delegates went to one winner, who ended up being Trump. "You speak about what’s unfair, so in Florida you had 99 delegates," he said in a speech in Rome, N.Y. "And Jeb Bush had it set -- Jeb Bush or Rubio, both of them. They had it set so that the winner takes everything, because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything." Did Bush and Rubio set the Florida primary for winner-take-all because they wanted to prevent Trump from getting any delegates? Republican officials did hope a winner-take-all primary would benefit Bush or Rubio, but Trump gets some of his key facts wrong. Who decided winner-take-all In February 2015, state Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, chair of an elections committee, announced that he would introduce a bill to set Florida’s presidential primary on March 15, 2016. In the primaries of 2008 and 2012, Florida had gone rogue with its primary date, with state GOP legislators setting the date of Florida’s primary earlier than national leaders wanted. (Early states like Iowa and New Hampshire are picky about other states’ primary dates.) In 2012, national leaders punished Florida by taking away half of its delegates. The March 15 date for 2016 meant Florida was back to following the national party’s suggestions. "We want Florida to be meaningful and relevant in the presidential elections," Richter told the Miami Herald in February 2015. "We don't want to come under any penalties and we want to have the candidates come to Florida and actively campaign." Richter also said at the time that it would help Florida’s favorite sons -- Bush, a former governor, and Rubio, a U.S. senator, if they decided to run. (Rubio announced in April and Bush announced in June.) Richter told PolitiFact Florida that leading up to introducing his bill "I had absolutely no conversations whatsoever with Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or any of their representatives or campaign or anything." Because the state was back to following the rules on the date, it had an option whether to set the primary as winner-take-all or to award delegates proportionally. State officials decided to go with winner-take-all. But Richter said that there were no conversations among leadership or the Senate about Trump when setting winner-take-all. "Not once did Trump’s name come up at any point in time," he told PolitiFact Florida. At the time, the winner-take-all choice was talked about as a gift to Bush, who was viewed as the top Florida candidate early on. "The winner-take-all primary was a very good thing for Jeb -- before Marco got in," Ana Navarro, a Bush supporter told the Tampa Bay Times in May 2015. "When people, including me, were calling their legislators, telling them to make it winner-take-all, we were all still under the mistaken impression that Marco wasn't going to run." The bill sailed through the Legislature unanimously, and Gov. Rick Scott signed it March 19, 2015. (This was months before Trump’s June announcement that he would be running.) On May 16, the Republican Party of Florida’s Executive Board formally accepted the state plan and announced a winner-take-all election. (The board voted unanimously, including vice chair Joe Gruters, who would later go on to be Trump’s co-chair.) "Florida will now be the first winner-take-all primary in the country, this ensures that all presidential campaigns will have to spend a considerable amount of time in Florida speaking to Republicans from Pensacola to Key West and everywhere in-between," said party chair Blaise Ingoglia. PolitiFact Florida asked Gruters: Is there any proof that Bush or Rubio had winner-take-all set? "Not that I’m aware of," he said. "My guess is they wouldn’t have to. Looking at all the (Republican) people voting in the Legislature, they were 80 percent Bush guys and the other 20 percent were Rubio guys." We found no evidence that state legislators and party officials were even thinking about Trump when they were setting the date. Trump said he might run in January 2015 and started giving speeches, including at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. It wasn’t until July -- the month after Trump announced his candidacy -- that the New York billionaire started to lead in many national polls. It was clear that Florida Republican powerbrokers hoped that winner-take-all would help Bush or Rubio win. But in the end, that wasn’t the case. Bush suspended his campaign a few weeks before Florida’s primary and Rubio ended up only winning his home county of Miami-Dade while Trump swept the rest of the state. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said that Bush "had no role at all" in setting the winner-take-all system. A spokesman for Rubio declined to respond. Our ruling Trump says that Bush and Rubio "had it set so that the winner takes everything, because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything" in the Florida primary. It wasn’t Bush or Rubio who set those rules for the March 15, 2016, primary. It was the Florida Legislature that passed the bill setting the date, allowing the state GOP to decide whether to make it winner-take-all. By that point, Trump was a potential candidate, but he wasn’t seen as a major threat to Rubio or Bush -- especially in Florida -- at that point. We rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ef0a3218-a00f-4779-83b7-9ca0a4a90676	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-04-18T11:57:32	2016-04-12	['Marco_Rubio', 'Jeb_Bush']

pomt-15365	Says his book, The Art of the Deal, is "the No. 1 selling business book of all time."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/donald-trumps-art-deal-best-selling-business-book-/	Appearing on CNN to defend his controversial comments on "rapist immigrants," Donald Trump said he doesn’t understand why Republican party leaders are so quick to publicly dismiss him. After all, Trump reasoned, he’s surging in the polls and has had a track record of success: He attended one of the best business schools in America, created a hotel and entertainment empire, and is a bestselling author to boot. "They like to say, well, we don't consider him a serious candidate. Why wouldn't I be?," Trump said on July 1. "I went to the Wharton School of Finance, I was a great student. ... I go out, I make a tremendous fortune. I write a book called The Art of the Deal, the No. 1 selling business book of all time, at least I think, but I’m pretty sure it is. And certainly a big monster, the No. 1 bestseller. I do The Apprentice, a tremendous success, one of the most successful shows." We were curious about Trump’s literary credentials. Did he pen the top-selling business book of all time? The Art of the Deal, a memoir that offers readers 11 steps for business success, was a smash when first published in November 1987. Trump hosted a celebrity-filled launch party, landed on the covers of magazines and toured the late night talk show circuit to promote and discuss the book. "The momentum around the book was tremendous," wrote journalist Timothy L. O’Brien in a biography of the mogul. "The voice that sprang from the pages was entirely original, seemingly candid, relentlessly boastful and refreshingly unafraid to take swipes, settle scores, and opine with an I-am-what-I-am gusto. The Art of the Deal was a tour of the business world according to Mister Id, and readers ate it up." It spent 51 weeks on the New York Times' bestseller list and, according to some reports, sold 1 million copies. Neither the Trump campaign nor the book’s publisher got back to us, so we were unable to verify this figure. Instead, we looked at data from Nielsen Bookscan. The data isn't perfect. For one, it counts sales only since 2001. And for another, it only tallies the number of print copies sold by major booksellers (about 85 percent of the market). According to Nielsen data, The Art of the Deal has sold about 177,000 copies in all its editions: Published Binding type Publisher Sales since 2001 Nov. 1, 1987 Hardcover Random House 17,000 Jan. 1, 1989 Mass market paperback Random House 90,000 Dec. 1, 2004 Mass market paperback Hachette Book Group 70,000 It’s difficult to weigh Trump’s opus against other "business books" for two reasons. One, best-seller lists are almost always periodical. Amazon tallies sales by the hour, while the New York Times’ lists are by week or by month. Greg Cowles, who writes for the New York Times "Inside the List" column, says the paper doesn’t track all-time sales. Second, the genre called "business books" is nebulous and can range from memoirs and essays to financial tips and management strategies. Trump’s book can certainly be shelved in the business section, as it’s both a memoir by a business executive and offers business advice. But experts say it can hardly count as influential in the subcategories or important in the broader genre. "Trump is full of B.S.," said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of business management at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. "The best selling/most important business books would have to be In Search of Excellence by (Thomas) Peters and (Robert) Waterman that started the genre, Built to Last by Jim Collins, The One Minute Manager by Ken Blanchard and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey." The Art of the Deal isn’t used in business schools like Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy, nor is it a text business executives find useful like Machiavelli's The Prince, said Lawrence White, a business and economics professor at New York University's Stern School. As for prominent biographies of business executives, Daniel Raff, who teaches at Trump’s alma mater of Wharton, listed books about Steve Jobs and by Lee Iacocca. We looked at some of these titles and, for good measure, threw in Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends & Influence People, which promises pathways to attain professional goals (Warren Buffett is a fan), and Robert Kiyosaki’s personal finance guide, Rich Dad Poor Dad. The authors and publishers of these popular books offer self-reported estimates; we’ve also included the independently compiled Nielsen data. Here’s how Trump’s book stacks up: Title Published Estimated sales Nielsen data (since 2001) How to Win Friends & Influence People 1936 15 million 2.27 million The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 1989 10 to 25 million 2.18 million Rich Dad Poor Dad 2000 4 million (as of 2004) 6.99 million Steve Jobs (hardcover edition) 2011 3 million 1.74 million The Art of the Deal 1987 1 million 177,000 Competitive Strategy 1980 NA (60 editions) 71,000 In Search of Excellence 1982 3 million (as of 2001) 54,000 Whether you’re looking at estimated sales or actual figures from Nielsen BookScan, The Art of the Deal has sold fewer copies than at least four other books. Our ruling Trump said his 1987 memoir The Art of the Deal is "the No. 1 selling business book of all time." The highest estimate pins the number of sales at 1 million, which we weren’t able to verify. According to one source of sales data, The Art of the Deal sold 184,000 physical copies since 2001. There are no lists of all-time sales, but we weighed The Art of the Deal against other popular books in its genre. While the book was very successful, it comes nowhere near claiming the title of top seller. Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People and Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People easily outpace it. We rate the claim False.

pomt-02415	"It isn't me cutting the budget. It's the Congress' decision on sequestration. So it isn't secretary of defense or the president doing this."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/05/chuck-hagel/hagel-says-congress-responsible-defense-cuts-not-o/	President Barack Obama released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 on Tuesday. One point of contention is that the budget he proposed will reduce the army to its smallest size since 1940. On CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told host Bob Schieffer that he’s not responsible for those cuts. "It isn’t me cutting the budget," he said. "It’s the Congress’ decision on sequestration. So it isn’t the secretary of defense or the president doing this, and I think we should clear that up a little bit here, too." At first glance, Hagel attributing defense cuts to Congress contradicts Obama’s proposed budget, which itself cuts Department of Defense funding levels. PolitiFact wanted to review how the cuts came to be, and how that affects the defense budget. How the sequester came to be Congress passed the Budget Control Act in August 2011 to resolve the debt ceiling crisis. Republicans and some Democrats insisted that the Obama administration offset an increase in the debt ceiling, the amount of money the treasury can borrow, with a plan to reduce the nation’s debt. Had Congress not passed this law, the United States could’ve defaulted on payments like Social Security and Medicare for the first time in history. The Budget Control Act included $1.2 trillion in cuts and formed a joint House and Senate super-committee to find another $1.2 trillion by Nov. 23, 2011. Since the super-committee failed to do this, the law called for sequestration, or across-the-board spending cuts, to go into effect in 2013. Each year, budget cuts are split evenly between non-war defense spending and discretionary domestic spending. Lawmakers in both chambers passed this act with bipartisan support, and then Obama signed it into law. We’ve reported before that the Obama administration originally proposed the sequester as a tactic to get Congress to come up with more targeted spending cuts. Since both Democrats and Republicans stood to lose funding for things they supported, it was widely thought that they would work out a deficit reduction and stop the sequester before 2013. Essentially, Congress and Obama both approved a measure they’re now unhappy with and forced to work around. "It’s always entertaining to me to see everyone trying to run away from (the sequester)," said Todd Harrison, a defense budget studies senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "Everyone agreed to it except for the Pentagon." How Obama pushed back against the sequester The White House and Congress jointly established the sequester in 2011. But as Harrison noted, there’s a contradiction here. Recently, both groups have taken some action to exceed the sequester’s cap on defense spending. The budget caps for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 were set in December with a bipartisan budget agreement from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that rolled back the sequester in favor of more specific cuts. The 2015 defense spending cap was set at $496 billion, about $7 billion more than the sequester would have allocated. The Ryan-Murray deal left it up to Congress and the Department of Defense to determine how the cuts would be distributed. Again, this bill had support on both sides of the aisle. Obama signed it into law Dec. 26. Obama’s 2015 main defense budget proposal doesn’t exceed the $496 billion approved defense spending cuts he and Congress set up. However, he also proposed giving the Pentagon an extra $26.4 billion as part of a separate budget package, a $56 billion, paid-for investment fund called the Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative. He proposed giving the Department of Defense funds for weapon systems modernization, readiness restoration and facilities improvement. In fiscal year 2014, the Department of Defense effectively didn’t see any cuts because funding above the cap was moved to the war budget, a separate fund for Afghanistan, Harrison said. The White House hasn’t yet proposed a 2015 war budget, because that’s dependent on how many troops will stay overseas. Obama’s 2014 and 2015 proposals show that his ideal figure for defense spending is higher than what the sequester caps allow for. That said, since 2011, Obama’s defense proposal figures have come down slightly, while the Budget Control Act’s have come up. So although the Obama administration wants defense spending to exceed the caps, he’s not necessarily advocating for pre-sequester level spending. Our ruling Hagel said it wasn’t he or Obama that made defense cuts, it was Congress in passing the sequester. Hagel himself wasn’t working in government at the time, so he has no tie to the cuts. Obama literally signed Congress’ defense cuts into law in both 2011 and 2013. At the same time, his budgets have proposed funding defense spending at a level above what the caps call for, showing that he doesn’t fully support the very agreements he signed. Hagel’s claim omits two instances where Obama supported defense spending cuts on record. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-04166	Says the Senate will have a record number of female senators in 2013.	true	/texas/statements/2012/dec/19/kay-bailey-hutchison/kay-bailey-hutchison-senate-farewell-says-record-2/	In her farewell address to U.S. Senate colleagues, Kay Bailey Hutchison—the first Texas woman in the body—said, "It’s been a long and wonderful 19-plus years." Hutchison, a Republican, added that while she’s leaving the 100-member body, she departs knowing that "January will see the greatest number of female senators in our nation’s history." Is that right? By email, Hutchison spokesman Tom Flanagin pointed out a Bloomberg News article posted online Nov. 7, 2012, opening: "Women will occupy a record number of U.S. Senate seats--one in five--in January, following victories in yesterday’s balloting." The story says five women, four of them Democrats, won first terms in the Senate, the results meaning that when the new Congress convenes in January 2013, 20 members will be women. "Currently, 17 women--which had been the record--serve in the chamber," the story says, adding that Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Hutchison are retiring. We harvested historical perspective from a Senate web page listing the 39 women who have served as senators since a 24-hour appointee, Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, took the oath in November 1922. Current female senators, in order of seniority with the most experienced first, are: Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Hutchison; Snowe; Mary Landrieu, D-La; Susan Collins, R-Maine.; Deborah Stabenow, D-Mich.; Marie E. Cantwell, D-Wash.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Kay Hagan, D-N.C.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. News accounts say the Senate's 2013 newcomers include Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Deb Fischer, R-Neb.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. Footnote: Hutchison was among seven female senators on her initial swearing-in in June 1993, according to the Senate web page. Women have held more than 10 Senate seats since 2001, more than 15 since 2007. We rate this valedictory claim as True.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2012-12-19T15:31:51	2012-12-19	['None']
pomt-10532	A mailer from the Obama campaign "accurately indicates" that Hillary Clinton would "force uninsured people to buy insurance, even if they can't afford it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/barack-obama/force-yes-but-she-wants-it-affordable/	In a debate the week before primaries in Texas and Ohio, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama argued yet again over their health care plans. Clinton charged Obama with distorting her health care plan in a mailer, while Obama stuck by its claims. The mailer states in part: "The way Hillary Clinton's health care plan covers everyone is to have the government force uninsured people to buy insurance, even if they can't afford it." Clinton said that wasn't an accurate description of her plan. "It's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not," Clinton said, adding "my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable." But Obama defended the mailer, saying that it "accurately indicates that the main difference between Senator Clinton's plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care." "If it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as they've done in Massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out. And if that's the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate." When candidates talk about universal health care plans, they usually mean that every person in the country will be covered. Clinton's plan achieves that with an individual mandate, requiring every person in the country to either have insurance or buy it. Obama's plan does not have a similar mechanism, and Clinton regularly criticizes him for it. Clinton's plan also has several strategies for lowering costs so that insurance is affordable. (Many of these strategies are similar to Obama's plan.) She wants to expand Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program and seeks to limit premiums that people pay to a certain percentage of their income. Obama's argument is that there will be some people who don't get health insurance through work but who make too much money to qualify for special programs. If those people don't buy their own insurance, they will be fined, and that's punitive, according to Obama. Clinton said during the debate that that won't happen because her plan has enough subsidies to make sure insurance is affordable for all. Her implicit argument is that there won't be any people who can't afford coverage or who don't qualify for a free or low-cost plan. A big part of this mandate debate hinges on future events: Can Clinton's health care plan lower costs enough so that even low-wage workers pay only a reasonable portion of their income for coverage? The experts we've talked to say a lot will depend on what the actual legislation looks like, and clearly that's a future event. Right now, though, Obama's characterization of Clinton's plan seems too reductive. Yes, it does "force" people to buy insurance in the sense that a mandate requires everyone to be covered. But her plan's intention clearly is that everyone will be able to afford it. Obama's mailer makes it sound like Clinton's plan is a ham-handed law, and that Clinton isn't concerned with cost. So we can't completely agree that Obama's mailer is accurate. We rate his statement to be Half True.

pomt-12637	Texas "spent close to a third of its budget on Medicaid last year, a third of all state spending."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/mar/28/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-Texas-Medicaid-spending-counts-state-f/	Extolling the health care act that Republicans briefly advocated as an improvement on the Obamacare law, Sen. John Cornyn singled out how much Medicaid costs Texas state government. In March 9, 2017, Senate floor remarks brought to our attention by a reader, the Texas Republican prefaced his claim by saying state and federal governments "spend an awful lot of money on Medicaid," the federal-state entitlement program providing health coverage to the poor, especially mothers, children and the disabled, which was launched by Congress in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. Cornyn went on: "In Texas, for example, my state spent close to a third of its budget on Medicaid last year, a third of all state spending." We emailed Cornyn’s office to request his backup, then turned to the authoritative May 2016 Fiscal Size-up report from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises state legislators on spending matters. That report, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie shortly advised by email, was the basis of Cornyn’s claim along with other published accounts of Medicaid’s share of the two-year budget approved by the 2015 Legislature. According to the report, the 2016-17 Texas budget devoted $61.2 billion in funds from all sources, including state and federal aid, to Medicaid, which lately has had a monthly caseload of 4.1 million residents, up from about 2.1 million in 2002, according to a 2017 LBB presentation --and that amount over the two years running through August 2017 accounted for 29.3 percent of $209.1 billion in All Funds appropriations. Federal funds drive Medicaid budgets because by law, the federal share of a state’s Medicaid expenditures can’t be less than 50 percent though the share is refined for each state using a formula comparing the state’s average per capita income to the national average. In Texas in fiscal 2016, the federal share broke out to about 57 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Also, each Texas dollar spent on Medicaid that year was matched by $1.33 in federal aid, the foundation says. We noticed another way to frame the issue in that Cornyn referred to Medicaid accounting for one third of all "state" spending in 2016. That’s not correct. According to the Fiscal Size-up, the 2016-17 budget allocated $25.2 billion in state general revenue and GR from dedicated accounts — meaning state funds — to Medicaid. Those billions, we calculated, amounted to 22.1 percent of nearly $114 billion in total GR and GR-D spending in the two-year budget. Separately, we asked the Texas Health and Human Services Commission how much Medicaid absorbs in money budgeted by lawmakers. By email, Christine Mann shared an agency chart showing the escalating share of Medicaid spending in the budget, considering both state and federal aid, from fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2015. Medicaid absorbed about 20 percent of budgeted state and federal funds in 2000, the chart indicate, but it’s accounted for 25 percent or more of the All Funds budget since 2010. Spending decisions remain Mann also pointed out that exactly how much legislators commit to Medicaid for the budget that runs through August 2017 will depend on actions during the session that ends May 29. As of mid-March 2017, Mann said commission staff expected Medicaid spending to be around $63 billion in state and federal funds. Traditionally, lawmakers adjust for increases in Medicaid caseloads and costs that build up between sessions by signing off on short-term supplemental appropriations. A March 2017 LBB document summarizes a version of House Bill 2, which proposes additional spending through August 2017. From figures in the document, we calculated that lawmakers could end up authorizing $63.8 billion in spending, both state and federal, on Medicaid, through the 2016-17 biennium; barring changes, that would break out to 29.8 percent of the state’s total budgeted spending of $214.3 billion. We also sought insight from Oliver Bernstein of the budget-savvy liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities. Bernstein emailed us slightly different figures for what’s likely to be spent on Medicaid through August 2017. He otherwise suggested by email that Medicaid’s heightened share of total spending traces in part to cuts in state support for public schools and institutions of higher education; when other big items get whittled, Medicaid’s budgetary significance grows. Our ruling Cornyn said Texas "spent close to a third of its budget on Medicaid last year, a third of all state spending." Nearly 30 percent of state plus federal aid in the 2016-17 Texas budget went to Medicaid. About 22 percent of state funds alone was appropriated for Medicaid. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-07183	Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson "appears to endorse world government."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/09/gop-critics/anonymous-gop-officials-claim-commerce-nominee-joh/	Supporting climate change policy is one thing, but is Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, John Bryson, an advocate for world government? That's the speculation raised by anonymous GOP sources on Capitol Hill, according to the conservative website the Daily Caller. Bryson, former chief executive officer and chairman of Southern California energy conglomerate Edison International and co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, has been under fire due to his support for clean-energy legislation. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., called him an "environmental extremist" and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a global warming skeptic, says he fears Bryson would implement climate change policy that would hurt American businesses. Bryson's nomination is also opposed by Massachusetts Democrats, Reps. Barney Frank and John Tierney, because of the NRDC's fight for fishing-catch limits. But the claim that Bryson supports a "world government" raises the rhetoric to a new level. The speculation originated in a June 7, 2011, story in the Daily Caller that ran under the headline: "Commerce nominee appears to endorse world government in video, Republicans say." Here's how the story begins: Does John Bryson, Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, want a world government? Critics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does. In the video – given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill – Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as "the closest thing we have to a world governance organization," implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe. Bryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video. The story includes a link to a 1-minute and 25-second clip of Bryson making a formal presentation to an unidentified group. Here's the fuller context from the attached video: "I thought that one of the things that is, in my judgment, not as well covered in the press and not as well understood as it ought to be is the kind of global picture on addressing clean energy and climate change. One of the things that have been a particular pleasure for me over the last year is I’ve been working as an adviser to the Secretary General of the United Nations on that subject. So I thought I would talk a little about that, talk a little about Copenhagen, a little bit about the global environmental and energy picture as I see it. Where we are. Where we might go. I thought I’d start there…So, let’s start with Copenhagen. So Copenhagen, obviously the United Nations is the global entity, the closest thing we have to a world governance organization. Copenhagen negotiations take place under the auspices of the United Nations as does the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the side of the body that’s developed this growing consensus about the effects of carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions on climate change." That seems like pretty flimsy evidence on which to base speculation that Bryson "appears to endorse world government." So we contacted Daily Caller reporter John Rossomando to find out who provided the video and made the claims. Rossomando wrote back that, "it came from GOP officials on the Hill, of whom I am not a liberty to name." We tracked the origin of the video to a presentation Bryson made at an energy symposium hosted by the University of California Berkeley on March 4, 2010. It's actually about an hour-long speech, with a brief Q & A, which you can watch here. In the passage in question (at about the 10-minute mark), Bryson was talking about the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly known as the Copenhagen Summit, and the perception that nothing was accomplished because no treaty was reached. Bryson made a case that, actually, they did accomplish a good deal. Although it fell short of the binding pact hoped for by many environmental groups, the summit produced a nonbinding emissions deal knows as the Copenhagen Accord. According to a New York Times account on Dec. 20, 2009, "The plan does not firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming." "That means there was no binding legal obligations that came out of what happened in Copenhagen," Bryson said in his Berkeley address. "...But those are nonetheless commitments on behalf of the leaders of those countries." "Certainly bringing the nations of the world together around addressing climate change and moving toward consensus and effective agreement on working together is vitally important," Bryson said. Bryson talked about the need to think about climate change on a global basis, but at no point did he advocate for ceding power to the United Nations, let alone advocating anything as extreme as creating a world government. Brian Darling, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who was quoted in the Daily Caller story, said it may be a rhetorical stretch to suggest that Bryson was advocating a world government. However, Darling said, what Bryson said on the video is of concern. Bryson seems to suggest that he supports giving the U.N. "authority to impose climate change policy on other countries." At the least, he said, Bryson ought to be questioned by Congress about the video and made to explain his position. Myron Ebell, a climate-change skeptic at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the portion of the clip posted by the Daily Caller "implies that (Bryson) supports global governing institutions. That is, he supports Kyoto and successor agreements to require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These international agreements are administered by an institution, the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), that is administered by the UN, which Bryson says is 'the closest thing we have to a world governance organization.' Supporting the Kyoto Protocol thus seems to imply that he supports some sort of world governance organization. But not quite necessarily." However, Ebell said, "supporting some global institutions that govern some aspects of life is not the same as supporting world government." To suggest the clip is evidence that Bryson supports a world government is a "stretch," he said. "I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that he does, but more evidence is required to establish what he really believes or supports. I think that what we do know about Mr. Bryson already is sufficient to disqualify him to be Secretary of Commerce from our perspective, which is why we oppose his confirmation." We contacted the White House press office to see where Bryson stands on the whole "world government" issue, but they declined to comment, saying the fuller context of Bryson's statement -- even in the short clip on the Daily Caller site -- is enough to definitively refute the claim. We agree. Referring to the United Nations as "the closest thing we have to a world governance organization" isn't exactly a smoking gun. We didn't hear any evidence in Bryson's full, hour-long address that suggests he wants to cede the U.S. government's authority over climate change policy to the United Nations, let alone something as radical and all-encompassing as a world government. No wonder the GOP officials who leaked the video and provided the speculation decided to remain anonymous. We rate the claim False.

pomt-14369	In the primary election, a "right-wing group spent more than $100,000,000 to support" Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/21/joanne-kloppenburg/joanne-kloppenburg-wrongly-claims-outside-group-sp/	Ads from so-called "dark money" groups are cropping up in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Under existing campaign finance rules, the groups don’t have to disclose who is giving them money or how they are spending it. But the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, among other organizations, tries to put a number on spending by the dark money groups, based in part on measuring their activity, such as how many TV ads they purchase. So, just how much was spent in the primary? This jaw-dropping quote was posted on the website for challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg, an appeals court judge taking on Justice Rebecca Bradley: "In the primary election, a right-wing group spent more than $100,000,000 to support Rebecca Bradley." You read those zeros right -- that’s $100 million. The Kloppenburg web site went on to warn: "The very conservative Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (WMC) group has pledged to support (Bradley) as well." Yikes. When we asked Kloppenburg campaign spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken about the claim, she said it was a typo. "They spent more than $1 million," she said. "I corrected it." She later added: "No one visiting our website has previously brought this obvious typo to our attention, no doubt because they knew that even Rebecca Bradley supporters couldn't spend $100 million on a February primary." So, the write-down aside, where does the estimate come from? And what group is Kloppenburg talking about? The Democracy Campaign’s web site includes an article in its Hijacking Campaign 2016 section that highlights spending by the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform, which it describes as a "Madison-based conservative issue ad group formed late last year." The group bought television time in the Madison, Green Bay, La Crosse, Eau Claire and Milwaukee markets for an ad that it said "dubbed Bradley, who is one of the court's five conservative judges, an independent jurist who has earned the support of numerous members of the law enforcement community." The group also ran radio ads in support of Bradley. The Democracy Campaign estimates the group’s pre-primary spending as running between $750,000 and $1 million. More ads sponsored by the group that criticize Kloppenburg have begun to air as the April 5, 2016 general election approaches. Our rating Kloppenburg said that a conservative group spent $100 million in ads supporting her opponent in the primary election. The claim was 100 times off-base. We rate it False.

pomt-04631	Says five studies show his tax plan can cut rates and still bring the same revenue without raising taxes on the middle class.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/14/mitt-romney/romney-claims-5-studies-back-his-tax-plan/	In the relentless back and forth over which candidate would raise taxes on middle-income Americans, President Barack Obama used a study from the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, as fuel for an ad claiming Mitt Romney would cut taxes on the rich and raise them for middle-income taxpayers. We examined that ad and ruled it Mostly True. The Tax Policy Center study has become a thorn in the side for the Romney campaign and the former Massachusetts governor is now refuting its findings. "The good news," Romney said on NBC’s Meet the Press, on Sept. 9, 2012, " is that five different economic studies -- including one at Harvard, and Princeton, AEI and a couple at the Wall Street Journal -- all show that if we bring down our top rates and actually go across the board -- bring down rates for everyone in America -- but also limit deductions and exemptions for people at the high end, you can keep the progressivity in the code, you can remain revenue neutral and you create an enormous incentive for growth in the economy." For this fact-check, we will look at these five studies. Our focus is on whether Romney is correct that they show Romney’s tax plan can cut rates and still bring in the same amount of money as today without raising taxes on the middle class. The Romney campaign sent us links to five items. One was a Wall Street Journal article from Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and an adviser to the Romney campaign; one was from Harvey Rosen, an economist at the Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies at Princeton University; one was by Matt Jensen, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank; and two were Wall Street Journal editorials. All five criticize the Tax Policy Center for making certain assumptions or ignoring particular data. The point of all five is that the numbers do in fact add up for Romney’s plan. Briefly, that plan would cut individual and corporate rates, eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, give savings and investment income preferential treatment, and still keep total tax revenues the same. The Tax Policy Center concludes that in order to do all of that, taxes on middle income taxpayers would have to rise. In this item, we will take each of the five studies on Romney’s list in turn, with responses from the Tax Policy Center where available. Martin Feldstein, Harvard University "Romney’s tax plan can raise revenue" Feldstein, the Romney adviser, uses 2009 data from the IRS to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class. First he estimates the lost revenue due to Romney’s 20 percent across the board rate cut and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Feldstein figures that would be $186 billion. Romney says he would offset those losses by eliminating or reducing deductions for higher income taxpayers. Some of the big ones are the home mortgage deduction, charitable giving, and state and local taxes. So Feldstein’s next step is to look at how much money could be tapped from that pot. At this point, he makes an important decision. He defines high-income as households making $100,000 or more. The Tax Policy Center sets the bar at $200,000 and anyone making less is part of the middle class. There is a significant amount of money tied up in that $100,000 to $200,000 range. In 2009, Feldstein says, the total value of itemized deductions for households making $100,000 and up was about $636 billion. Feldstein picks a mid-point for the tax rate of these households, 30 percent, and assumes all of that could potentially end up in the government’s coffers. "What do we get when we apply a 30 percent marginal tax rate to the $636 billion in itemized deductions," Feldstein asks. "Extra revenue of $191 billion—more than enough to offset the revenue losses from the individual income tax cuts proposed by Gov. Romney." Feldstein underscores that he isn’t advocating such a move. He only notes that eliminating deductions, or broadening the tax base as it is called, can net huge returns. The response The Tax Policy Center countered that Feldstein needs to go after the deductions used by less affluent people -- those making between $100,000 and $200,000 -- in order to make the books balance. The center analysts also note that this assumes these people would not be allowed to take even the basic standard deduction. They further challenge Feldstein’s use of the 30 percent tax rate, saying a more accurate estimate is 24 percent. The combined impact of retaining the standard deduction and the lower rate, they say, leaves Feldstein $70 billion short of the revenues lost through the rest of Romney’s tax cuts. Harvey Rosen, Princeton University "Growth, distribution and tax reform: Thoughts on the Romney proposal" Rosen’s main point is that any assessment of the Romney tax plan that ignores its impact on economic growth is incomplete. "This is curious," Rosen said, "because increasing growth is the motivation for the proposal in the first place." Growth creates more income for the government to tax which would help offset the revenues lost through rate cuts. Rosen said he’s not alone in thinking this oversight is odd. He said economists he spoke to were "incredulous when I told them that the numbers being discussed in the press are based on calculations that explicitly rule out any changes in labor supply or saving behavior." Rosen readily admits that no one can accurately predict the future so he runs the numbers using three growth rates for GDP - 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent. By comparison, the White House budget planners assume an average rate of close to 3 percent. Like Feldstein, he used 2009 data. Unlike Feldstein, he analyzed what happens for taxpayers making $100,000 and up, and then repeated it for those making $200,000 and up. Rosen found that when all possible deductions are eliminated, from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits, it means that increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax cuts. There is only one scenario where Rosen saw a wrinkle -- when households making less than $200,000 are shielded from the loss of deductions under certain tax and growth assumptions. Rosen saw a $28 billion gap and said "maintaining an approximately constant tax burden on high-income individuals would be more challenging." But not "mathematically impossible." The response Some news organizations noted the Tax Policy Center did factor in higher growth in its original study. It used a model developed by a Romney adviser, Gregory Mankiw, and found that while growth softened the burden on people making less money, the shift is still there. "Our results are not qualitatively different, even if we include additional taxes generated from the growth effects," the authors wrote. The center said groups including the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation take a cautious approach on assuming that tax changes alone will lead to new growth. This is particularly true when tax cuts are combined with base-broadening, which lies at the heart of the Romney plan. The center pointed to a study from two American Enterprise Institute economists that found the two changes largely cancel each other out, leaving effective tax rates about the same and thus have little impact on growth. Matt Jensen, American Enterprise Institute, "How the Tax Policy Center could improve its Romney tax study" Jensen challenges the Tax Policy Center findings on two fronts. First, he said it should have considered the elimination of two tax breaks that the center’s analysts said "were off the table." One is the interest on state and local bonds; the other is interest on life insurance policies. "Both of these exclusions largely benefit the wealthy," Jensen said. "Added together their repeal would net upwards of $90 billion that could be redistributed to lower-income individuals." Jensen called his analysis "nothing if not rough." Jensen also said the center’s definition of who is high-income is arbitrary. Rather than declare everyone over $200,000 as high income, he suggested the center show the lowest income level at which the Romney plan would work out mathematically. The response The Tax Policy Center challenged Jensen’s "rough" $90 billion figure. It said a more accurate figure would be $25 billion. Wall Street Journal Editorial No. 1, "The Romney Hood Fairy Tale" This editorial largely draws on other work. It echoed Jensen’s criticism that the Tax Policy Center failed to consider certain tax breaks. It labeled the center authors as "class warriors" and charged that the center "ignores the history of tax cutting." "Every major marginal rate income tax cut of the last 50 years," said the editorial writer, "1964, 1981, 1986 and 2003 — was followed by an unexpectedly large increase in tax revenues, a surge in taxes paid by the rich, and a more progressive tax code—i.e., the share of taxes paid by the richest 1 percent rose." It cited the work of Feldstein and scoffed at the center’s treatment of the impact of Romney’s plan on people making less than $30,000. Currently, many who work for little pay get money back at the end of the year through tax credits. "The claim is that reducing various refundable tax credits that are cash payments from the government are a 'tax increase,'" said the editorial writer. "By this logic, reducing unemployment benefits or food stamps would also be a tax increase." The editorial also said the center’s findings are "refuted by President Obama's own Simpson-Bowles deficit commission report. The Romney plan of cutting the top tax rate to 28 percent and closing loopholes to pay for it is conceptually very close to what Simpson-Bowles recommended." The response The Tax Policy Center said there are great differences between Romney’s tax plan and both the 1986 tax law and the Simpson-Bowles commission. Mainly, Romney would continue to tax capital gains and dividends at low rates and he would eliminate the estate tax. The 1986 law treated capital gains as ordinary income and retained the estate tax. The Simpson-Bowles proposal did too. Wall Street Journal Editorial No. 2, "Mathematically possible" This editorial largely focused on the matter of the overlooked loopholes and relies on the work of Jensen at the American Enterprise Institute. So although Romney treated it as a fifth "study," it is essentially redundant of Jensen's analysis. Comparing the methods behind the studies Not all studies are created equal. The Tax Policy Center used a complex computer model that took over 150,000 individual tax records from 2004 and simulated the impact of Romney’s tax plan in 2015. The researchers cited by Romney relied on 2009 information and worked with large summary numbers, not individual returns. Did it make a difference? Maybe not. "You like to use a micro-simulation when you can," said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, "but you often get approximately the right answer with those larger aggregated numbers." Auerbach also said there is no clear dividing line that separates high-income households from all others. The Tax Policy Center chose $200,000 -- but different breakpoints could also be valid. However, the use of 2009 versus 2004 data was pivotal. The researchers cited by Romney said they used 2009 tax information because it was the most current. But that doesn’t necessarily make it better. Indeed, 2009 was the bottom of the recession In pure dollar amounts, upper income households saw more of a drop because a lot of their income comes from investments and investments suffered. In 2009, they had less income that would benefit from the lower rates Romney proposes. Accordingly, the cost of a tax cut would be smaller and so would the amount you would need to pick up by getting rid of tax deductions and other tax breaks as Romney has said he wants. "It would be easier to do in 2009," Auerbach said. Auerbach said, "If you think the future will look more like a non-recession year, then you would want to use data from a pre-recession year." We asked him whether editorials count as studies. "I don’t pay much attention to editorials," Auerbach said. "They refer back to other research and they’re just opinion." Our ruling Romney said that five studies show that his tax plan can cut rates and still bring in the same amount of money as today without raising taxes on the middle class. Romney is using the word "studies" generously. Two items on his list are newspaper editorials that can be analytical but are rarely treated as independent research. One article comes from a campaign adviser, a connection that generally suggests a less than independent assessment. That leaves just two reports out Romney’s five. There is a fair argument to be made that the Tax Policy Center used an arbitrary dividing line of $200,000 to separate high-income households from all others. The same problem lies in setting the breakpoint at $100,000, a choice preferred by at least one of the defenders of Romney’s proposal. The studies from Feldstein and Rosen use 2009 data. That was an abnormal year and one that made it easier to make the math work for the Romney plan. The analysts could have chosen other years but decided not to. We see no more than two independent studies out of the five claimed. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-09-14T11:06:27	2012-09-09	['None']

pomt-00206	After Hurricane Hermine in 2016, Tallahassee "didn’t have power for weeks because (Mayor Andrew Gillum) stood in the way of crews being able to come in and restore power, because they weren’t members of the right union or something."	false	/florida/statements/2018/oct/16/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-wrong-about-andrew-gillums-response-20/	As northern Florida recovers from Hurricane Michael, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., portrayed Democrat Andrew Gillum as ineffective in helping his city of Tallahassee recover from a hurricane in 2016. Rubio leveled his charges in front of a group of supporters of Gillum’s rival for governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, in West Miami on Oct. 15. "When they had a hurricane up there, they didn’t have power for weeks because he stood in the way of crews being able to come in and restore power, because they weren’t members of the right union or something," Politico reported Rubio as saying. Javier Manjarres, a conservative writer, captured Rubio’s comments on video. Rubio’s claims are inaccurate, and we’ll explain why one by one. Rubio’s spokeswoman did not respond. "Didn’t have power for weeks" Rubio exaggerated the length of the power outage. The Sept. 1, 2016, storm took out the vast majority of Tallahassee’s power. The outage left more than 75,000 customers of the city's municipal electric system and 20,000 customers of the nearby cooperative electric company, Talquin Electric. Tallahassee residents complained about the restoration pace on social media. But a nearly 400-page Leon County report about Hurricane Hermine response months later showed most people received power within one week. The report stated that by Sept. 7 "electrical service was restored to approximately 90 percent of city customers and nearly all Talquin customers in Leon County, significantly ahead of the estimated schedule that both agencies communicated to the public." The county report stated that nearly all city customers were restored by Sept. 9, "with remaining outages generally associated with damage to customers’ service lines that connect an individual meter to the pole." The state emergency response team tweeted that 2 percent of Tallahassee customers had no power as of Sept. 8, 2016. "Stood in the way of crews being able to come in and restore power" This statement by Rubio echoes a Mostly False claim by the Republican Party of Florida. It isn’t true that Gillum blocked utilities from assisting with the storm recovery. After the storm hit, Eric Silagy, Florida Power and Light CEO, said he had 575 personnel ready to help. But Rob McGarrah, the city’s general manager of utilities, was confident the city had engaged enough assistance from eight other utilities, the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald reported after the storm. He did not immediately jump on the offer by FPL and said that coordination with the visiting crews was important to "make sure what we're doing is safe." The city of Tallahassee is not a strong mayor form of government in which a mayor operates much like a CEO of a company. It wasn’t up to Gillum or city commissioners to accept or reject help from various utilities; that decision was in McGarrah’s hands. "Because they weren’t members of the right union or something" There is no evidence that the city based any decisions about utilities based on union affiliation, despite what Rubio and DeSantis have claimed. Rubio’s suggestion that Gillum, a Democrat, only wanted union help makes no sense based on what actually happened. City workers helping to restore power were not unionized — and they still aren’t, Jamie Van Pelt, chief of staff of Gillum’s mayoral office, told PolitiFact. Meanwhile, Florida Power & Light employs unionized crews and also works with both union and non-union contract personnel, said company spokesman Mark Bubriski. Barry Moline, who coordinated with other utilities at the time in his role as the head of the Florida Municipal Electrical Association, said he didn’t know about the union status of Tallahassee electric lineworkers, either then or now. "It has NEVER been an issue when I have chosen lineworkers to assist utilities for any restoration, including the Hermine restoration in Tallahassee," Moline told PolitiFact. "I never took that information into consideration and no one ever asked me to do so." In a Facebook post days after the 2016 storm, Gillum addressed rumors that the city was turning down help based on political motivations. "It appears that the heat has driven some to speculate wildly about what help I have accepted or rejected on behalf of the City in our effort to recuperate from this storm. Some have suggested that I have refused help from any company that is not unionized. Others have stated that I have refused help offered by any Republicans. And still others have suggested a machiavellian attempt by me to surrender residents to my will by prolonging suffering and delaying any power from being restored - rendering them utterly helpless to my liberal agenda," he said, adding in an emoji with a frown. Gillum continued: "Let me be clear. We are happy to accept any help from any person or organization that is going to accelerate the speed at which we can safely restore power to our residents." Our ruling Rubio said after Hurricane Hermine in 2016, Tallahassee "didn’t have power for weeks because (Gillum) stood in the way of crews being able to come in and restore power, because they weren’t members of the right union or something." The vast majority of Tallahassee customers had power within a week, according to a county report, a state office and media reports at the time. There is no evidence that Gillum rejected an offer of help to restore power based on union or political concerns. The decision about whether to accept help from various utilities was in the hands of the city’s general manager of utilities. Rubio’s storm of concern does not have the facts to back it up.

That’s a made-up story resurfacing on social media. An obscure website called Phoenix Post published a story Aug. 14 headlined, "VIDEO Kevin Bacon Saying ‘We Are Blessed To Have Donald Trump As Our President’." But there’s no video of Bacon saying that. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The false story has been around for months on other websites. Bacon in December 2017 tweeted a link to a Gossip Cop story debunking the narrative. "Wow. Thanks for clearing this up," Bacon wrote in the tweet. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Bacon went further in a separate December tweet, saying there was nothing about Trump’s policies "that I agree with. And nothing about his character that I admire." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Phoenix Post claimed Bacon’s praise for Trump came during an interview on ABC’s This Week. But the Gossip Cop story shared by Bacon noted that the actor hadn’t been on the ABC show since 2007. The Phoenix Post’s headline explicitly says "Kevin Bacon," but the text of the story replaced his last name with "publisher 1st baron verulam," or "1st Baron Verulam" (apparently trying to reference a title given to the philosopher Francis Bacon).

pomt-10850	"Congress only funded half the wall" between Mexico and the United States.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/07/bill-richardson/remainder-of-money-in-pipeline/	At the Democratic Univision debate on Sept. 9, 2007, candidate Bill Richardson said a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border was only half-funded by Congress. Here's his statement: "This wall is a horrendous example of Washington misguided policy. Congress only funded half of the wall." Richardson got it mostly right, although Congress has taken steps to pay for additional portions. The ultimate cost is still uncertain, however. In 2006, Congress approved building the wall in the Southwest to restrict undocumented workers' access into America. It will run 850 miles when built, according to the Congressional Research Service. Congress has approved $1.2-billion to pay for it -- about half its estimated cost. But Richardon's statement gives the impression the funding has stopped. In fact, the White House and Congress have taken steps to pay for the remainder of the fence, although there is still some disagreement about what form the fence will ultimately take. The White House requested another $1-billion in spending for the fence in 2008. The House approved the spending in June 2007 but with strict requirements because Democrats are skeptical of the proposal. The Senate has not yet approved it.

mpws-00003	The legislative session may be over, but that doesn’t mean we’ll stop hearing about pre-kindergarten any time soon. The issue was a major flashpoint between Gov. Mark Dayton’s administration and legislators, including DFLers in the Senate. It came down to this: Should the Legislature set aside millions to fund pre-kindergarten in all public schools or boost overall school spending and target other dollars to families who are least likely to be able to afford quality early education? Ultimately, Dayton and legislators settled on the latter option, passing a $17 billion education bill. But in the final hours of the special session, Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, said the money isn’t well spent in the first place. “It’s a great babysitting service. But you have no empirical evidence to prove that pre-K doesn’t wear off by third or fourth grade,” he said during debate over the bill. 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/06/poligraph-cornish-pre-k-claim-misses-mark/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Cornish pre-K claim misses mark	June 17, 2015, 2:04 PM	None	['Mark_Dayton', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party']
pomt-14910	Under his tax plan, "the greatest gains, percentage-wise," will be "at the lower end of our plan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-biggest-percentage-gains-his-tax-/	During the CNBC Republican presidential debate, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sparred with one of the moderators, John Harwood, over the impact of his tax proposal. Harwood asked Rubio, "The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale. Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck, don't you have that backward?" Rubio responded, "No, that's -- you're wrong. In fact, the largest after-tax gains (are) for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them." As it turns out, they both have a point -- and later in the exchange, Rubio acknowledged that’s the case. Let’s take a closer look. Rubio’s plan First, let’s review what Rubio is proposing. He would: • Collapse the current seven brackets to just three -- 15 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent -- and set the top bracket’s rate lower than the current 39.6 percent top rate; • Exempt interest, dividends, and capital gains from income taxes; • Repeal the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax, and all taxes levied under the Affordable Care Act; • Reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, down from 35 percent; • Create a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child; • Replace the standard deduction with a new refundable personal tax credit of $2,000 for individuals or $4,000 for married couples filing jointly. This credit would phase out at $150,000 for individuals and at $300,000 for married couples filing jointly and would disappear entirely at $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married couples filing jointly. In theory, these tax credits could be helpful to those at the lower end of the income scale as long as they are refundable -- that is, as long as people too poor to pay any income tax can get money back from the government. There has been a dispute over exactly how the refundability would work, and how different types of taxpayers could come out ahead under Rubio’s proposal. How this shakes out will have a potentially large impact on how favorable the Rubio plan would be for low-income Americans. But since the details aren’t settled, we will set that aside and focus instead on the Tax Foundation analysis, which was the one specifically referenced in the debate. We should note that the Tax Foundation is not the only organization that analyzes tax plans, and it tends to have a more free-market, low-tax approach than other groups that do similar work, notably the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The Tax Foundation assessment The part of the Tax Foundation analysis at issue is where they put the Rubio plan through an in-house mathematical model to determine how much incomes for different groups would change under the plan’s provisions. The foundation looked at two models. One, known as the "static" model, gauges the direct changes of the Rubio tax plan. The other, known as the "dynamic" model, factors in assumptions about how the tax changes would reverberate through the economy to create higher growth. For brevity, we’ll look at just the static results, which are actually more favorable toward Rubio’s claim, since they show stronger results for low-income taxpayers compared to higher-income taxpayers. Here’s what the foundation concluded, grouping people by 10 percent increments from lowest earning to highest earning: So, taxpayers with adjusted gross income in the bottom 10 percent will, according to the foundation, see a 44.2 percent increase in their income, while those in the 10 percent to 20 percent category will see an increase of 11.4 percent. Those are the only two categories with increases higher than 5.5 percent. According to this chart, then, Rubio has a point -- at least when you define "the greatest gains, percentage-wise" as the increase in adjusted gross income by members of the lowest two deciles. Another way to look at it However, there’s another way to look at Rubio’s plan, and it doesn’t shine as favorable a light on how lower-income Americans would fare. Part of the reason why the gains by lower-income Americans stand out in this calculation is that their gains are high compared to a very small income base. Measured by raw dollars, people at the top of the income spectrum would receive the majority of the benefits. Because we had to cobble together the data from two sources that aren’t exactly the same -- the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center -- it doesn’t produce a perfect calculation. But the results are wide enough to conclude that richest one-fifth benefits disproportionately from Rubio’s plan. Here’s the summary: Quintile Average after-tax income level for that quintile Average percentage gain in after-tax income under Rubio’s plan Average dollar gain in after-tax income under Rubio’s plan Each quintile’s percentage share of total income gains under Rubio’s plan Bottom 20% $12,478 27.8 percent $3,469 22 percent 2nd lowest 20% $30,191 5.4 percent $1,630 10 percent Middle 20% $51,687 2.1 percent $1,085 7 percent 2nd highest 20% $85,961 1.2 percent $1,031 6 percent Top 20% $238,685 3.7 percent $8,831 55 percent Total $16,046 100 percent The last column shows that a majority -- 55 percent -- of all new income gains under Rubio’s plan would flow to the top 20 percent of Americans. That’s more than twice as much as would flow to the bottom 20 percent of Americans -- the group Rubio said would benefit most. Middle-income taxpayers would actually fare the worst of all -- the middle 60 percent would get less than quarter of all new gains. Again, these are rough estimates. But the contrast is wide. Looking at it this way, "the greatest gains, percentage-wise," would not be "at the lower end of our plan," as Rubio put it. They would be at the top. And the wealthiest quintile’s benefits from the Rubio plan even outstrip the amount they pay into the tax system. Tax Policy Center data for 2013 shows that the top quintile paid 27.5 percent of all federal taxes. But they get back nearly twice that share of the benefits from Rubio’s plan. As it happens, Rubio seemed to acknowledge as much during the debate. When pressed by Harwood later in the exchange, Rubio said, "Five percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money, numerically, it's gonna be higher." Still, Rubio stuck by his earlier claim. "The greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are going to be be at the lower end of our plan," he said. Our ruling Rubio said that, according to the Tax Foundation, "the greatest gains, percentage-wise," will be "at the lower end of our plan." Rubio has a point that, at least according to the foundation’s projections, the largest percentage income gains would show up in the bottom two deciles. However, it’s important to remember that in raw dollars, these gains are relatively modest compared with the total benefits that would accrue under the tax plan at the upper end of the income spectrum. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-11-04T13:18:07	2015-10-28	['None']
pomt-02179	Up "to 45 percent" of illegal immigrants "are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border. They are visa overstayers."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/apr/28/julian-castro/eight-year-old-estimate-basis-claim-45-percent-ill/	Julián Castro slammed Republican state Sen. Dan Patrick for not sharing his perspective on immigration issues, asking Patrick at one point if he’d even read federal immigration legislation stalled in Congress. And another thing, the Democratic mayor of San Antonio said during the April 15, 2014, Univision program: "Do you know that up to 45 percent of the people who are here undocumented or illegal, whatever word you want to use, are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border? They are visa overstayers; they are people that came to this country and then just overstayed their visa." Castro’s declaration rang a bell. In September 2013, we found Mostly True a claim by U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, that about 40 percent of U.S. illegal immigrants "came in on an airplane, with a legal visa, and just overstayed their visa and have never gone home." That percentage aligned with an oft-repeated estimate, supported by a 2006 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, of the share of unauthorized residents who had overstayed visas, though we came up with no research into how many overstayers came by airplane. By email, Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo said the mayor’s statement drew on a 2013 web post on overstayers by the Federation for Immigration Reform, whose mission statement is to educate Americans about the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. The group’s post said that up to 45 percent of unauthorized immigrants are overstayers. Group cites 2006 Pew document But it wasn't citing fresh research. Instead, the figure was attributed to the June 2006 Pew Hispanic Center fact sheet earlier bandied by Carter. Pew wrote then: "Nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." "As much as 45% of the total unauthorized migrant population entered the country with visas that allowed them to visit or reside in the U.S. for a limited amount of time," Pew said. "Known as ‘overstayers,’ these migrants became part of the unauthorized population when they remained in the country after their visas had expired," it said. Pew continued: "Another smaller share of the unauthorized migrant population entered the country legally from Mexico using a Border Crossing Card, a document that allows short visits limited to the border region, and then violated the terms of admission. The rest of the unauthorized migrant population, somewhat more than half, entered the country illegally." A wrinkle: The center’s estimate of overstayers initially ranged from 38 percent to 50 percent of unauthorized residents. The center split the difference by proposing its figure of up to 45 percent. How the estimate was reached Specifically, the center estimated, some 4.5 million to 6 million of the 11.5 million to 12 million unauthorized residents as of 2006 entered legally through ports of entry. The bulk of these entrants came in as tourists or as business visitors, the center said. According to the government, the center said, there were 179 million nonimmigrant admissions in 2004, meaning individual entries by foreigners authorized for temporary stays. The center said its estimate came from modifying a methodology devised by a government demographer who analyzed internal files in the 1990s to estimate the size and key characteristics of individuals who overstayed their visas. In 1997, the demographer, Robert Warren, concluded that the unauthorized migrant population totaled 5 million and that 2.1 million, or 41 percent, consisted of visa overstayers, according to the center, while Homeland Security later estimated that about one third of unauthorized residents in 2000 were visa overstayers and the Government Accountability Office, drawing on alternate data sources, put the percentage of such overstayers at 27 percent, 31 percent and 57 percent. Of course, the data in the Pew report, in addition to being estimates, are several years old, causing us to wonder what has changed. In 2013, Jeffrey Passel, the center’s senior demographer, told us by email the information had not been updated, though he’d seen "no evidence of a significant change in the makeup of the resident unauthorized population in terms of method of arrival." We were unable to reach him for this follow-up fact check. Our ruling Castro said up to 45 percent of illegal immigrants "are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border. They are visa overstayers." That’s supported by the nearly eight-year-old estimate created by the Pew Hispanic Center, though it was based on calculations suggesting overstayers could comprise as few as 38 percent of illegal residents up to half of them. This range and the age of the estimate amount to additional information missing from Castro's claim, which we rate as Mostly True.

pomt-05729	Says Ted Cruz slurred Republican senators including John Cornyn as "graybeards" and "spineless jellyfish."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/05/david-dewhurst/ted-cruz-ted-cruz-slurred-republican-senators-incl/	David Dewhurst says another Republican candidate to succeed U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison isn’t likely scoring points with incumbent Senate Republicans. Dewhurst, the Texas lieutenant governor, said of Ted Cruz in a Feb. 22, 2012, statement: "How effective will a senator be who slurs his GOP colleagues and party activists, including Sen. (John) Cornyn, as ‘graybeards’and ‘spineless jellyfish?’" Did Cruz, a lawyer and former Texas solicitor-general, refer to established GOP senators -- all 47 -- in those terms? The Dewhurst statement refers to a Feb. 21, 2012, Dallas Morning News news article noting Cruz’s decision not to endorse Cornyn at that time to be the party’s Senate whip. In contrast, the story says, several other Texas Republicans running for the Senate--Dewhurst, former ESPN announcer Craig James and former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert--aired support for Cornyn. The News’ story quotes Cruz saying he won’t decide his vote for the whip post until after November’s elections once it’s clear how many "constitutional conservatives" got elected. "I’m not going to prejudge," the story quotes Cruz saying. It later quotes him saying he’s not ruling out support for Cornyn in the end. According to the story, Cruz and Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., argue that the Senate is at a "tipping point" and they predict a dramatic power shift with a handful of new conservatives to prod fellow Republicans toward more urgency when it comes to slashing spending and curbing government. "It’s not a win for conservative principles to get a spineless jellyfish," Cruz is quoted saying. The story then says that Cruz routinely compares himself to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who won his seat in 2010. "In every one of those states," Cruz said, "the party graybeards were supporting somebody else. The establishment had somebody who was already picked to be quote ‘a member of the club.’" The story then says Cornyn, as part of the Senate leadership, "apparently is one of those graybeards," reporter Todd J. Gillman wrote. Cornyn chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is dedicated to electing Republican senators. And in 2010, Cornyn supported then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist over Rubio for the Sunshine State’s Senate seat, the News’ story notes, after which he conceded he’d made a mistake and further agreed to remain neutral in party primaries. DeMint pledged not to undermine incumbent Republicans in his quest for allies willing to "rock the boat," the story says. A Nexis search revealed no other Cruz references to graybeards, though he previously invoked jellyfish. According to a July 26, 2011, Dallas Morning News commentary by Gromer Jeffers Jr., Cruz said at a July 2011 meeting of the Denton County Republicans: "All of us have been burned before by candidates who sound good on the trail and got into office and turned into spineless jellyfish. The basis of my campaign is a proven conservative record of over and over again standing up, fighting for conservative principles and winning on a national level." By email, we asked Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch if Dewhurst had additional backup for Dewhurst’s claim. Hirsch pointed out a November 28, 2011, Morning News’ blog post, based on blogger David Jennings’ interview of Cruz. Jennings had written that day that Cruz told him that before each of four senators -- DeMint, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mike Lee of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania -- endorsed his candidacy, "their single most important question was this: Could he stand up to the leaders of the Republican Party? Cruz said that each of the men told him that the leadership of their own party had been their biggest hurdle, not Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. They wanted to make certain that he knew this and would be willing to look Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell in the eye and tell him no." Morning News’ reporter Robert Garrett added: "By indirectly attacking McConnell, ...whose No. 2 sidekick in the leadership is expected to be (Cornyn), isn't Cruz unnecessarily alienating his party's leaders even before he gets to Washington?" We asked Cruz’s campaign if it had anything to share regarding Dewhurst’s claim. By email, Cruz spokesman James Bernsen called Dewhurst’s claim false and scurrilous. Cruz has never called Cornyn by those names, Bernsen said. And when he bemoans "spineless jellyfish," Bernsen said in a telephone interview, Cruz is not referring to any senators in particular. "It’s referring to people in the Republican Party in general who are not as committed to conservatism," Bernsen said. "He doesn’t mention individual people like that." Bernsen said in a follow-up email: "Ted has never once stated, suggested, or referred to Sen. Cornyn as anything other than what he is - an honorable and effective public servant who fights for Texas." Our ruling Cruz used the terms "spineless jellyfish" and "graybeards" when talking about Republican candidates and conceivably even senators whom he views as insufficiently conservative. On that, Dewhurst has a defensible point. However, It’s less clear that Cruz was talking specifically about Cornyn. True, his "graybeards" reference can be read to draw in Cornyn. But there’s no evidence that Cruz has directly labeled Cornyn (or any individual senator) as a spineless jellyfish. We rate Dewhurst’s statement Half True.

pomt-14610	"You've been tremendously deceived" by people who say the Earth is not flat.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/feb/01/bob/bob-duels-with-neil-degrasse-tyson/	It’s a rap battle straight out of the 15th century. On one side of the ring is rapper B.o.B., the hip-hop star behind hits like "Airplanes." On the other side is astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, known more for his truth-telling about the universe and climate change than spitting rhymes. Their beef: B.o.B. says the earth is flat. Yes, really. It all started going down Jan. 24 when B.o.B. tweeted a picture of himself at a high elevation, with two distant cities — but no discernable curve — on the horizon. He then tweeted a series of images intended to raise questions about the fact that the Earth is round. "I'm going up against the greatest liars in history," he wrote. "You've been tremendously deceived." Step in, Tyson. The popular astrophysicist published a brief series of tweets to counter B.o.B., including the fact that the Earth’s curve does shield part of the Manhattan skyline from a distance, but the buildings are too tall to be fully obscured. Tyson ended with: "Duude — to be clear: Being five centuries regressed in your reasoning doesn’t mean we all can’t still like your music." The debate escalated when both B.o.B. and Tyson dropped rap tracks, Tyson’s rapped by his nephew, calling each other out (sample lyric: "I'm bringing facts to combat a silly theory because B.o.B has gotta know the planet is a sphere, G"). We won’t attempt to rap; we’d only embarrass ourselves. But we did ask a few astronomers what they would tell B.o.B. to convince him the Earth is round. To be clear, this is a settled question. Since at least the ancient Greeks, people have had a hunch that the Earth is round, and it has been accepted as a universal truth for the past few centuries. Cornell University astronomy professor Lisa Kaltenegger pointed out the obvious: Pictures and videos taken from space clearly show the Earth is spherical. For example, NASA scientist Reid Wiseman took this timelapse from the International Space Station. She said there’s an experiment B.o.B. and others could do. He could fly from the East Coast to Australia, going over Europe and Asia. Then he could fly back going over the Pacific Ocean and landing on the West Coast. If the Earth was flat, you would not be able to take both routes to and from a single destination. It’s a modern-day version of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan’s 16th century voyage, the very first circumnavigation of the globe. We also know the Earth is round because of the curved shape of the Earth’s shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse, said Raymond Jeanloz, an astronomy professor at the University of California Berkeley. Further, the planet reacts to earthquakes in a very different way than it would if the Earth were a flat plane, Jeanloz said. Then there’s time zones, the fact that the sun appears at different angles at the same time in different locations. And, while you have to be fairly high up with clear skies to see the Earth’s curve, you can observe the effects of curvature from the Earth’s surface by watching a large ship go over the horizon, disappearing from the bottom up. Could there be a global conspiracy to hide the fact that the Earth is flat? No way, said David Trilling, an astronomy professor at Northern Arizona University. Millions of people and many countries, as well as numerous private corporations, would all have to be in on it, and they would somehow have to keep all the evidence concealed in the age of Buzzfeed and Wikileaks, he said. "There is no chance that a secret that big could be concealed," he said. Rather, "the evidence for a round Earth is abundant and all around us." Our ruling Rapper B.o.B. said, "You've been tremendously deceived" by people who say the Earth is not flat. The world’s scientists have gathered proof that the Earth is round for centuries. Now that we’re in an age where we can view the Earth from space, we can say with certainty that our planet is spherical. Even without a spaceship, we can see the effects of a round Earth by watching a ship on the horizon or looking out of an airplane window on a clear day. B.o.B.’s claim is Pants on Fire! Correction: Ferdinand Magellan was Portuguese, not Spanish. An earlier version of this article was incorrect on this point.	None	B.o.B.	None	None	None	2016-02-01T16:27:29	2016-01-25	['None']

pomt-02052	Rick Perry doesn’t think there should be a federal minimum wage.	true	/texas/statements/2014/may/30/democratic-national-committee/2014-rick-perry-saying-he-opposes-federal-governme/	It didn’t surprise us to read that Gov. Rick Perry opposes a hike in the federal minimum wage. Many Republicans do. Our curiosity was stirred by another claim in a May 29, 2014, email to reporters from the Democratic National Committee: "Perry not only opposes raising the minimum wage… he doesn’t think there should be one." None whatsoever? The current Texas minimum wage, tied by law to the federal minimum, is $7.25 an hour. Nationally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states had minimum wages exceeding the federal minimum as of January 2014, while Delaware’s minimum was set to pass the federal minimum as of June 2014. Perry said in a Feb. 21, 2014, appearance on CNN’s Crossfire: "I don’t think that it’s the government’s business to be setting the minimum wage out there." A week later, Perry elaborated on Iowa Press, a program on Iowa Public Television. Asked if he would repeal the minimum wage law if it were up to him, Perry said: "I think you leave that to the small businessmen and women. I mean, the competitive nature of the free market works really well." Pressed to air a repeal position, Perry replied: "I don’t know whether I would repeal it or not. But I don’t think that the federal government in Washington, D.C., needs to be… setting... the standard out there. I think" if " it’s left to the small businessmen and women of the country, it makes a lot more sense to me." He added: "If a state wants to set a minimum wage, that should be that state’s prerogative, but not out of Washington, D.C." Perry, asked if he would repeal the state minimum wage in Texas if federal law didn’t impose a minimum, said: "I would leave it up to the Legislature to have a conversation on it and have a good debate about it. You know, is this a job creation or is it a job killer? If it’s killing jobs, I’m not going to be for it." After we tracked down these appearances, DNC spokeswoman Kiara Pesante offered them up by email as the basis of the group’s claim. Footnote: Perry may not have entertained the prospect of government not setting a minimum wage in the past. According to an Oct. 22, 2006, Houston Chronicle news story on the Texas governor’s race that fall, Perry declined to say if he favored raising the state minimum wage (then $5.15) above the federal level; the story said Perry "reiterated his support" for the state’s minimum-wage law as written. We contacted Perry's office about where he stands on this topic and didn't hear back. Our ruling The Democratic committee said Perry doesn’t think there should be a federal minimum wage.

pomt-03907	Says the federal government is earning more tax revenue now "than any other time."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/28/kevin-mccarthy/rep-kevin-mccarthy-says-federal-government-has-mor/	There’s no need to raise taxes as part of reducing the nation’s deficit, says House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy. Broad, blunt spending cuts known as the sequester go into effect March 1 unless Congress steps in. Democrats would prefer to reduce the deficit partly by raising taxes. But the California Republican argued on Fox News that any solution should cut spending only — there’s plenty of revenue, he said. "There's more money going in than any other time," he told host Greta Van Susteren on Feb. 25, 2013. "In the last four decades, on average, we brought in 17.9 percent of GDP. Now we're going to bring in 19.1." Is the federal government collecting more than it ever has — more than it has on average the last 40 years? Here’s what we found. ‘The last four decades’ McCarthy talked about "percent of GDP," a common tool of economists evaluating the impact of tax policies over time. They prefer to compare tax revenues as a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, the gross domestic product. It’s fairly easy to see why — using raw numbers wouldn’t account for inflation or changes in population, for example. Was McCarthy correct that the federal government used to collect, on average, 17.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and that the number will rise to 19.1 percent? McCarthy’s office pointed us to reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. A recent CBO analysis says that, indeed, federal revenue is projected to rise with changes in the law, such as the recent end to Bush tax cuts on households making more than $450,000 a year. "Revenues are projected to grow from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2015 — compared with an average of 17.9 percent of GDP over the past 40 years," CBO’s analysts conclude. So McCarthy accurately cites a reputable source when he says the federal government has collected an average of 17.9 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product over four decades, and now is "going to bring in 19.1." (We should mention that even with higher revenue, CBO projects that deficits will increase "because of the pressures of an aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and growing interest payments on federal debt.") But what about McCarthy’s claim that "there's more money going in than any other time"? That’s messier. ‘More money’ So, remember how percentage of GDP is a useful tool for comparing revenue over time? The government will pull in 16.9 percent in 2013, lower than the average over the last 40 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s not more money than at "any other time," as McCarthy said. What about in 2015, when the government is projected to bring in 19.1 percent? That’s still lower than revenue as a percentage of GDP in seven years of the last 40 — also not more money than at "any other time." Federal revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product 1981: 19.6 percent 1982: 19.2 percent 1997: 19.2 percent 1998: 19.9 percent 1999: 19.8 percent 2000: 20.6 percent 2001: 19.5 percent Source: Congressional Budget Office McCarthy’s office told PolitiFact that CBO projects revenue in 2013 will be the highest ever in raw numbers, at $2.708 trillion, up from $2.568 trillion in 2007. But that’s not the measure a listener would have assumed from McCarthy’s comments, which focused on revenue as a percentage of GDP — not raw numbers. Nor are raw numbers a useful way to compare amounts of money over time. The value of the dollar changes. Population changes. That means revenue in raw terms mostly climbs by default. Tax policy experts we spoke with called comparisons based on raw numbers "lousy," "never valid" and "silly." "Ignoring the increased value of the dollar and population growth both distort comparisons and make them meaningless," said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Our ruling McCarthy told Fox News, "There's more money going in than any other time. In the last four decades, on average, we brought in 17.9 percent of GDP. Now we're going to bring in 19.1." Starting in 2015, reputable projections show revenue rising to 19.1 percent of GDP, up from an average of 17.9 over the last four decades. But McCarthy’s wrong to say that there’s more money coming in than at any other time. In fact, the nation collected more than 19.1 percent of GDP in seven years of the last 40. To say that the nation will collect the most revenue in raw dollars in 2013, according to tax experts, is meaningless. We rate McCarthy’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-09964	On releasing photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/14/barack-obama/obama-reverses-release-abuse-photos/	President Barack Obama announced his administration was reversing course about the release of photographs depicting the abuse of foreign prisoners. We're rating this the first Full Flop of the Obama presidency. The matter involves serious issues of national security, government openess and the treatment of foreign prisoners, and it began years ago during the Bush administration. In 2003, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding the release of documents and photographs related to detainees being held overseas by the United States. When the Bush administration refused to release the information, the ACLU filed suit in federal court. The lawsuit has been plodding along ever since. It was one of the key factors for Obama's decision to release memos from the Bush administration that provided a legal justification for harsh interrogation methods that included waterboarding. The memos were released April 16, 2009. About a week later, the administration announced it intended to release photos depicting prisoner abuse as well. "The 2nd Circuit Court ruled in December of 2008 that the photos had to be released," said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on April 24. "The previous administration lost a court case on that. The Department of Justice decided based on the ruling that it was hopeless to appeal, and a mandate ordering the release of those photos came Monday. And the administration, the Pentagon, and the court entered into an agreement to release those photos. "So this is part of the very same case that (Office of Legal Counsel) memos were derived from. This was a court case based on information that was compelled to be released." But during the next two weeks, the Obama administration reversed course. On May 13, Gibbs said the administration would not release the photos and would appeal any rulings requiring it to do so. "The president does not believe that the strongest case regarding the release of these photos was presented to the court, and that was a case based on his concern of what the release of these would do to our national security," Gibbs said. "He believes that the release of these photos could pose a threat to the men and women we have in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, and doesn't believe that the government made the strongest case possible to the court and asked the legal team to go make that case." When pressed about the reversal, Gibbs implied that timing was an issue. "The argument that the president seeks to make is one that hasn't been made before. I'm not going to get into blame for this or that, understanding that there was significant legal momentum in these cases prior to the president entering into office," Gibbs said. Obama appeared later that day to make a statement on the decision. He said the photos were from investigations that had been completed prior to his taking office. "In other words, this is not a situation in which the Pentagon has concealed or sought to justify inappropriate action," Obama said. "Rather, it has gone through the appropriate and regular processes. And the individuals who were involved have been identified, and appropriate actions have been taken. "It's therefore my belief that the publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals. In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them, I believe, would be to further inflame anti-American opinion and to put our troops in greater danger. Moreover, I fear the publication of these photos may only have a chilling effect on future investigations of detainee abuse." Obama also said that the abuse of detainees in custody is prohibited. "Any abuse of detainees is unacceptable. It is against our values. It endangers our security. It will not be tolerated," he concluded. The ACLU sharply criticized Obama's reversal. "The Obama administration's adoption of the stonewalling tactics and opaque policies of the Bush administration flies in the face of the president's stated desire to restore the rule of law, to revive our moral standing in the world and to lead a transparent government," said executive director Anthony Romero in a written statement. "If the Obama administration continues down this path, it will betray not only its promises to the American people, but its commitment to this nation's most fundamental principles." Congressional hawks such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats, had urged Obama not to release the photos on the grounds that it would stoke recruitment among terrorist groups overseas. House Republican Leader John Boehner praised Obama's decision, saying, “Making these images public would only serve to embolden our enemies and increase the danger for our troops." Some will argue that Obama's reversal is a prudent course correction, while others will say it undermines his stated values of transparency. We're not taking a position on what the reversal means, but we are noting it as a complete reversal, the first one we've documented for Obama. We rate his change on the photo release a Full Flop.

pomt-04983	"Obamacare" represents "the largest tax increase in the history of the world."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/jul/22/charlotte-bergmann/memphis-candidate-bergmann-repeats-limbaugh-claim-/	Charlotte Bergmann, the Republican businesswoman running against physician George S. Flinn in the 9th Congressional District primary, put out a Fourth of July newsletter to supporters making a claim we’re hearing a lot these days – that the Affordable Care Act ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court is not just a tax, but "the largest tax increase in the history of the world." There are a lot of people making that or similar claims. Our colleagues at the national PolitiFact operation in Washington looked into one the earliest, by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. We’ll reprise some of its pertinent findings, and its rationale for giving his statement its "Pants on Fire" rating, below. We first asked the Bergmann campaign to provide the sourcing backing its claim. Bergmann’s spokeswoman, Brenda Fowler, sent us a list of selected taxes included in the health-care law. We’ll quote from the email: "--Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year tax increase: $210.2 billion. "--Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ‘Cadillac plans’ (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families) kicks in. That's a tax increase of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. "--Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year tax increase: $60.1 billion. "--Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's estimated to be an additional tax of $15.2 billion over the next 10 years." All of that appears to be accurate. It also appears to come verbatim from a larger seven-bullet summary of the tax provisions handed out by the federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress staffed by economists and accountants. Some of the taxes, as Fowler points out, don’t affect big segments of the population. The issue is simply whether the Affordable Care Act is the largest tax increase ever. Rather than examine tax increases that have been put in effect in Burkina Faso or the Maldives, or whether the Stamp Act or the tax on tea in the 18th century that precipitated the American Revolution were higher or more onerous historically, let’s just compare the ACA tax increases to tax revenue-raising legislation in the United States in this century. To summarize the national PolitiFact findings, by the time the new law is fully implemented, in 2019, it will have raised a total of somewhere between $437.8 billion and $525 billion. That sounds pretty big, but historically, Politifact discovered, the relative size of the tax as a percentage of the nation’s economy is lower than several other previous bills – including some signed into law by Republican presidents. Politifact’s estimation of the relative size of the tax compared how much revenue is raised in 2019, when the ACA will be fully implemented, to the projected Gross Domestic Product for that year. We use a formula designed by Jerry Tempalski at the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which looks at the revenue raised through tax legislation as a percentage of GDP going back to 1940. In 2019, when the act is fully implemented, it will generate $104 billion in increased revenue. With a GDP projected at $21.164 trillion, the ACA tax provisions will account for 0.49 percent of GDP. To make a long story shorter, Tempalski found that the Revenue Act of 1942, one of that era’s stimulus bills to finance World War II, accounted for 5.04 percent of GDP (more than 10 times the ACA’s impact). The Revenue Act of 1961 was 2.2 percent of GDP. The Current Tax Payment Act of 1943 was 1.13 percent of GDP. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act signed by Ronald Reagan was 0.8 percent of GDP. In fact, 10 other acts of Congress have been bigger in terms of their impact on GDP than "Obamacare" will be. Our ruling In an appeal to supporters to help fund her congressional campaign, Charlotte Bergmann repeated an assertion made by Rush Limbaugh that the Affordable Care Act created the largest tax increase in the history of the world. But we have consistently found that the ACA will bring in less revenue as a percentage of the entire national economy than many previous tax increases in U.S. history. That means the assertion by Bergmann and others that the health-care law is the biggest tax increase in world history cannot possibly be true. That claim is not just wrong but so far removed from the truth that we rate it Pants On Fire!	None	Charlotte Bergmann	None	None	None	2012-07-22T05:00:00	2012-07-04	['None']
pomt-14158	"Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/apr/29/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-repeatedly-voted-a/	The contention -- and the number -- seemed startling. On Equal Pay Day, Democrats said Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte had not only voted against equal paychecks for women, but she had done so multiple times. Both Governor Maggie Hassan, who is challenging Ayotte for her Senate seat, and the New Hampshire Democratic Party, blasted Ayotte in dual press releases on April 12, 2016. "It is extremely troubling that Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help ensure that women can earn equal pay for equal work." Hassan said in the release. Ayotte also put out out a statement about equal pay on the same day in April, which is the date that women, on average, have to work into the following year to make as much as men. In 2016, that date was April 12. Given that Ayotte has sponsored and promoted her own bill calling for equal pay, called the GAP Act, we decided to check it out. About the bill The bill in question is called the Paycheck Fairness Act, which according to its official legislative description "amends the portion of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) known as the Equal Pay Act to revise remedies for, enforcement of, and exceptions to prohibitions against sex discrimination in the payment of wages." Perhaps the strongest tool in the bill is the provision to "make employers who violate sex discrimination prohibitions liable in a civil action for damages." This language has inspired the most Republican opposition, including from Ayotte. She believes it exposes employers to frivolous lawsuits and other problematic litigation and could restrict merit pay, among other reasons, according to her office. She has therefore voted for a number of amendments and alternatives to the largely Democratic-backed bill. She’s currently supporting a piece of legislation called the GAP act, which "makes it clear that employers must pay women and men equal wages for equal work, while still preserving the ability to award merit pay and allow for flexible schedules," Ayotte and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito wrote in an op-ed for the Concord Monitor. The issue has taken on special resonance in Ayotte’s Senate re-election race, since she’s facing off against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who supports the act. The votes So let’s look at the four votes. Hassan’s campaign and the state party pointed them out to us. (The same votes were mentioned in an April 12 press release from EMILY’s list, a group that seeks to elect pro-abortion-rights women running as Democrats.) The votes were held on June 5, 2012; April 9, 2014; Sept. 15, 2014; and March 24, 2015. The first three were procedural votes, known as cloture. These are votes meant to cut off debate on a bill and bring it to the floor of the Senate for a vote. While an actual bill can pass with a simple majority in the U.S. Senate, it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture, meaning that as a practical matter, Senate passage requires a bill to have 60 votes rather than just a simple majority. Republicans often refuse to end debate on bills favored by Democrats, and vice versa. So, although Ayotte opposed the bill being debated and has said so repeatedly in public, it’s not entirely accurate -- at least in three of these cases -- to say that she voted against the paycheck bill itself. She was casting a procedural vote in these three cases, which is not exactly the same as up or down votes on the legislation. In addition, the final vote listed by the Democrats was for an amendment offered by Sen. Barbara Mikulski addressing the issue. Ayotte voted against the amendment, though she did vote for an alternative Republican amendment. The biggest omission by Hassan’s camp is leaving out a vote from Sept. 10, 2014, when Ayotte actually called for ending debate on equal pay legislation. She was one of 73 -- including a number of Republicans -- to cast votes doing so. According to her office, Ayotte hoped to change the bill but was denied the ability to do so by Harry Reid. Our ruling Hassan said that "Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act." Hassan glosses over some nuances -- most of the votes were procedural rather than substantive, and she leaves out a vote in which Ayotte cast a procedural vote in favor of advancing the bill. And it’s worth noting that Ayotte’s opposition to the bill doesn’t mean she’s an opponent of equal pay for women; rather, she and most Republicans have a substantive disagreement over the means to that end. Still, Hassan made her assertion specific -- Ayotte’s record on this particular piece of legislation -- and it’s clear that Ayotte has a longstanding record of opposing this bill. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Maggie Hassan	None	None	None	2016-04-29T14:20:05	2016-04-12	['Kelly_Ayotte']

pomt-08177	"The Madison-Milwaukee (high-speed) train line is dead."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/30/scott-walker/governor-elect-scott-walker-says-milwaukee-madison/	After weeks of discussion, maneuvering and protests, Governor-elect Scott Walker is taking a sharp new tack on the proposed Madison-Milwaukee high-speed rail link. Walker transition director John Hiller issued this statement Nov. 18, 2010: "The Madison-Milwaukee train line is dead." It was quoted in the JSOnline story headlined "Rail backers turn up heat on Walker" and repeated on television, and again several days later in USA Today. Hiller may as well have quoted directly from Meinhardt Raabe, the late Jefferson County, Wis., actor who played the Munchkin coroner in the "Wizard of Oz": "As Coroner I must aver, I thoroughly examined her. And she's not only merely dead, she's really most sincerely dead." At issue, of course, is the $810 million federal grant the state sought and won to extend Amtrak service from Milwaukee to Madison. The project is to be one link in a Midwest network of new high-speed rail service. Walker argues the state can not afford the operating expense of the train and has vowed to kill the project. As recently as Nov. 10, Hiller put it all in the future tense: "Governor-elect Scott Walker is going to fulfill his campaign promise to stop the construction of the Madison-Milwaukee train line." So what changed? Is the train really most sincerely dead even before Walker takes office? First, although it was Hiller who made the comment, he’s a Walker appointee. When we followed up with Walker’s office, transition spokesman Cullen Werwie simply repeated the statement. As such, we’ll treat it as a statement from Walker himself. In many ways, the comment recalls one made by U.S. Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood, who declared at a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee: "It’s coming. Nobody can stop this train." It was stated as fact, not an opinion or promise or prediction of the future. We looked at that statement and ruled it False, noting there were many ways Walker, once in office, could kill the project. The key, of course, was once in office. And that happens Jan. 3. In the meantime, there are plenty of people -- including President Barack Obama -- who support this project. And, if anything, the public discussion has recently centered on finding a way to answer one of Walker’s chief objections: the annual state subsidy to operate the train. That subsidy has been estimated at anywhere between $750,000 and $7.5 million, depending on whether the feds pick up the vast majority of the cost. LaHood’s office declined to discuss the matter with us. Among the things that could still happen: An outside group could cover the operating shortfall: Madison Mayor David Cieslewicz has said the city might be willing to help with the operating costs, noting his city’s chamber of commerce and other business groups support the project. "We’re willing to take a look at some of the operating expenses," said Cieslewicz aide Chris Klein. "If that’s the issue, we’re willing to help." So far, there’s no action taken by the Madison City Council on the matter, but the mayor is willing to "sit down and have a conversation about it," said Rachel Strauch-Nelson, communications director. Congress could take a new look at it: U.S. Rep. Tom Petri (R-Wisconsin) supported the train for years because that was the wish of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle and his predecessor Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. But then Petri backed away from it after Walker won. (That earned a Full Flop rating.) If the project is killed, Petri says, he favors using the money for deficit reduction rather than seeing it spent in other states. But even he’s not writing the obituary just yet. Petri told PolitiFact Wisconsin the operating cost was relatively minor in the context of the entire state budget -- and he expressed interest in gestures from Madison to help pay the operating costs. Petri, a long-time member of the House Transportation Committee, says he, too, is willing to talk about the project before it’s written off. "I’d like to see a decision made on a common sense agreed up set of facts," Petri said, adding that leaders must decide "whether it makes sense to pay penalties and back out." We asked Walker’s office how they would handle offers from Cieslewicz, Petri, the Obama administration or anyone else. For instance, would Walker support the route if there was no state subsidy involved? Walker’s press secretary Cullen Werwie said the governor-elect team wasn’t going to speculate. "There’s been a lot of ‘what ifs’," Werwie said. "We haven’t seen any legitimate proposal." "He’s following through on his campaign promise" to stop the train, Werwie said of Walker. In a Nov. 24, 2010 radio appearance, Walker told WTMJ-AM (620) radio host Charlie Sykes he remains against the train: "It doesn’t matter where the money goes back to or what it is for." Walker told Sykes his team has talked with the federal DOT about other possible uses of the money but provided no details. Meanwhile, the parameters of the discussion have changed in key ways since the Nov. 2 election. And they may continue to change: No money shifting to highways. On the campaign trail, Walker said he hoped the feds would agree to use the $810 million for highways or other purposes. LaHood told him no. Other states seeking the money. Leaders of New York, Illinois, California and North Carolina have indicated they would take the Wisconsin funds for their own projects. LaHood has said his department -- not Congress -- will handle reallocation of the money. Petri and U.S. Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisconsin) and Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) want the cash to go to deficit reduction, but that would require support from lawmakers in states that want the money -- and Obama, who has made high-speed rail a priority. Additional costs to the state. Doyle has pegged the cost to the state of backing out of the contract at more than $100 million. The exact amount would be somewhere between $14 million and the much higher figure, depending on a variety of factors because some of the spending would be used to improve the rail link from Chicago to Milwaukee. Train car maker Talgo has said it might move to Illinois. That would anger Milwaukee officials who rolled out the welcome wagon for the Spanish firm and spent $3 million preparing the former Tower Automotive site for Talgo. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker’s Democratic opponent in the governor’s race, has said the city would explore legal action to recoup the city’s investment in Talgo if the firm leaves. Beyond all that, two key mechanisms that Walker said he could use to kill the train -- refusing to budget operational funding and canceling contracts -- haven’t happened. And Walker can’t do either until he is in office. So where does that leave us? Scott Walker, via a top transition official, says the Madison-Milwaukee train is dead. But train backers -- some with large municipal budgets -- aren’t going away. Neither is the Sierra Club, Wisconsin Citizen Action, organized labor and other groups that have rallied on the project’s behalf. And neither is the Obama administration, which, for now, holds the purse strings on this project. The train may well be on its deathbed, it hasn’t yet passed to the stationhouse in the sky Just as LaHood’s pronouncement was premature -- and False -- this one is, too.

pomt-02040	Florida has "the most errors and exonerations from death row."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/02/aclu-florida/florida-aclu-says-state-has-most-errors-and-exoner/	On May 27, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Florida’s standard for executing intellectually disabled convicts, finding that the state’s IQ cutoff of 70 is too rigid. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that the standard, "creates an unacceptable risk that persons with an intellectual disability will be executed, and thus is unconstitutional." The case stemmed from a death sentence for Freddie Lee Hall, who in 1978 killed Deputy Lonnie Coburn and raped and murdered 21-year-old Karol Hurst. Hall scored between 60 and 80 on IQ tests over the decades. Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, said in a statement that Florida’s death penalty system is "broken" and that the Legislature must address its failings. "Florida is the only state in the country where the vote of a simple majority of jurors can recommend that a person receive a sentence of death. This has contributed to our state’s record of having the most errors and exonerations from death row." Does Florida hold the record for death row exonerations? Death penalty exonerations The ACLU of Florida obtained the information about Florida’s exoneration record from the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse that has written reports critical of the death penalty. The center shows the number of exonerations in 26 states that have the death penalty at any point between the 1970s through mid March 2014. The center counts an exoneration as a case where a defendant has been acquitted, pardoned or had their case dropped by prosecutors. Common scenarios that led to exonerations include cases where evidence was withheld by the prosecution, or where the defendant had ineffective trial counsel and then got a new trial that resulted in acquittal or dropped charges, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the center. More recently, DNA tests have also led to exonerations. So how do the numbers stack up? Florida was indeed No. 1, with 24 exonerations, followed by Illinois with 20 and Texas with 12. But there’s also a separate source of data -- the National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of the University of Michigan Law School and the Center on Wrongful Convictions at the Northwestern University School of Law. Launched in 2012, the registry provides information on exonerations for several types of crimes since 1989, including in death penalty cases. The registry uses a different definition of exonerations and it starts the clock ticking later than the other database does, so -- not surprisingly -- it produces different numbers. The registry shows that Illinois had 18 death penalty exonerations while both Louisiana and Texas had 10, followed by Florida with 8. These numbers suggest that Florida isn't in a category by itself in exonerations. For instance, in Illinois, several high-profile exonerations were so embarrassing that Republican Gov. George Ryan placed a 10-year moratorium on executions in 2000. In 2011, the Legislature passed a bill to abolish the death penalty and Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn signed it. So two sources count the numbers differently. Let’s take a closer look at what the statistics say about Florida’s use of the death penalty. Florida requires a unanimous vote by a jury to find a defendant guilty. However, during the penalty phase, Florida requires only a simple majority of the jury -- seven of 12 jurors -- to recommend a death sentence. Florida is the only state that allows such a simple majority vote, ACLU of Florida spokesman Baylor Johnson said. Two other states -- Alabama and Delaware -- allow for the death penalty to be imposed by less than a unanimous jury, but they have a higher standard than Florida does. Alabama requires a 10-2 vote, while Delaware requires that a unanimous jury find aggravating circumstances. Johnson pointed to a 2006 study by Oklahoma City University School of Law, which showed that based on jurors’ reports, jury members in Florida deliberated for less time and reviewed evidence less frequently than jurors in other states. A 2006 American Bar Association study of the death penalty raised concerns about allowing a non-unanimous jury vote for capital punishment. Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which supports the death penalty, takes issue with the use of the word "exonerate" on such lists. "When typical readers read that word, they think of a person who has been affirmatively shown not to have committed the crime," he told PolitiFact Florida. A person can be deemed "exonerated" if his conviction is overturned and the evidence is insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he argued. But the person could still be guilty, he argued. Our ruling Florida has "the most errors and exonerations from death row," ACLU of Florida executive director Howard Simon said in a press release. According to a count by the Death Penalty Information Center, Florida has exonerated 24 death row inmates -- the most of any state in the nation. But another resource that uses a different definitions of "exoneration" and has a different time period -- the National Registry of Exonerations -- shows Florida had eight exonerations, fewer than Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. The ACLU's claim makes it seem like Florida is unchallenged for the most exonerations, but the data is actually murkier. So we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12068	"We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/06/sean-duffy/testing-sean-duffy-claim-were-flying-1987-planes-1/	With House Republicans shifting from health care to tax reform and the budget, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy recently argued for an increase in military spending, claiming the U.S. military’s air fleet is antiquated and leaves the nation at risk. Duffy’s push for more military spending came during a July 20, 2017, interview on The World Over with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN, days before Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in the U.S. Senate. Duffy’s claim arose from a question by Arroyo about whether the U.S. spends too much on defense. Duffy (R-Wisconsin) responded with a firm "no," then rattled off a series of familiar talking points about the nation’s military: the military is depleted; there’s peace through strength; and it’s vital to stay ahead of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. To drive his message home, he made a very specific claim about the U.S. air fleet. "We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology," Duffy said. Duffy’s wider point about a depleted military is one PolitiFact has addressed in fact checks of other politicians, such as Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan. In this item, we’ll look at whether the U.S. is really flying planes from 1987 that have 1987 technology and what that says about the state of the military. Aging aircraft In 2015, Duffy did a fly-along in an F-16 with the Wisconsin Air National Guard’s 115th Fighter Wing in Madison. On the visit, staffers from the Air National Guard told him the planes were built in 1987 and had 1987 technology, aides to Duffy told us. "He received that information from the Wisconsin Air National Guard and took their professional guidance on the matter," said Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar. Capt. Joe Trovato, deputy director of public affairs for the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs, confirmed the fly-along happened and that Duffy recalled the conversation correctly. The F-16’s assigned to that specific fighter wing were built between 1986 and 1988, with the bulk in 1987. The conversation, however, was specifically about the F-16 and how peer or near-peer nations such as China and Russia are catching up and can match or exceed F-16 technology. In the EWTN interview, Duffy offered a broad statement about the nation’s military aircraft, without limiting it to specific planes or providing a sense of how many planes may fit the criteria. In any case, there is more to the story. The body and engines on the F-16’s in question remain largely the same as they did when they rolled off the assembly line. But in the years since, the government has upgraded weapons, sensors and software on the planes, Trovato said. For instance, they now have better GPS locator systems and better weapons and munitions. The aerospace policy experts we spoke with agreed with Duffy’s general sentiment, but said it passes over important context, such as the upgrades to the fighters. "These older aircraft have been upgraded and modernized over time," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank. "While the airframe may be old, the cockpit, navigation systems, sensors, and other electronics have been modernized. "An F-16 flying today is much more capable and technologically advanced than when it rolled off the assembly line in the 1980s." Still, Harrison and others said, there are limits to the upgrades: The F-16 can’t be upgraded to have the stealth capabilities common in the much newer F-22 Raptors or F-35 Lightnings. Laura McAndrews, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air Force, said in an email that the average age of aircraft in the Air Force is 27, and fighter and attack aircraft specifically have an average age of 25. Typically, when the military wants to introduce a new generation of aircraft, it can take two decades to get an aircraft from the conceptual stage to test stage and finally full integration into the nation’s air fleet, according to Harrison and other policy experts. The F-22 Raptors, which first got off the ground in tests in the 1990s, are among the most recent additions. The Air Force has 183 of them, according to fact sheets. The F-35 Lightnings, a program started in 2001, are part of a controversial $400 billion order that, over 20 years, aims to replace aging aircraft across three branches of the military, according to the Department of Defense. Our rating Duffy said, "We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology." In the case of the airplanes Duffy based his claim on, the engine and body remain largely the same as in 1987, but experts and the military say the F-16 has undergone other technological upgrades. In addition, Duffy’s statement is more general, which ignores ongoing efforts to modernize the fleet and purchase and design new craft. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-11947	"I personally am pro-choice. I always have been. And I made no qualms about that when I was elected governor."	true	/illinois/statements/2017/oct/10/bruce-rauner/rauner-consistent-start-his-pro-choice-views/	Gov. Bruce Rauner’s signing of a controversial abortion bill last month triggered an avalanche of protest from his fellow Illinois Republicans and anti-abortion groups, who said he had betrayed them. The bill, House Bill 40, removed a "trigger provision" in Illinois law that would have made abortion illegal should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade. It also made abortion eligible for coverage under Medicaid in Illinois and under the state’s employee health insurance plan. Opponents were angry that Rauner broke a promise he made five months earlier to veto the bill because of its Medicaid and insurance component, which for the first time would use state taxpayer funds to pay for abortion outside of cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother. They also claimed Rauner reneged on a campaign pledge that he had "no social agenda," which they interpreted as Rauner having no plans to change the state’s abortion laws. In a Sept. 28 press conference in which he announced his intent to sign the bill, Rauner lamented that he could not convince Democratic lawmakers to split the legislation into separate bills, one covering the trigger provision and the other dealing with insurance coverage. But he defended his action as consistent with his pro-choice principles. "I personally am pro-choice. I always have been. And I made no qualms about that when I was elected governor," Rauner said. Rauner’s statement sent us combing through video clips, ads and news coverage of the 2014 gubernatorial election to see if he really was consistent in presenting his pro-choice stance to voters during that hotly contested race. Here’s what we found. Plain talk Rauner, a wealthy private equity investor who had never run for elected office, sought to build his campaign solely on economic, educational and political reform issues. He stated often that he had no social agenda, and his wife, Diana, appeared in a campaign ad making that very statement. This helped Rauner avoid taking a direct stand on same-sex marriage, which was a hot topic in Illinois politics in the months preceding the 2014 GOP primary for governor. In May 2013, just before Rauner formally declared his candidacy, longtime state GOP chairman Pat Brady resigned in part because of fallout from him having declared his support for same-sex marriage. Rauner’s no-social-agenda claim also proved useful when it came to navigating the political minefield of abortion. To win election in a Democratic-leaning state, Rauner needed to get votes from Democrats who support abortion rights and moderate Republicans without antagonizing social conservatives. "My opponent is desperate for social issues to become prominent in the campaign," Rauner said in a campaign appearance with his running mate, Evelyn Sanguinetti, in June 2014. "And I’ve been crystal clear: I do not have a social agenda. Evelyn and I are not running on social issues. We all have our personal beliefs. We are not advocating leading on social issues, we are fine with the status quo on that." That said, we found several examples in which Rauner explained his position on access to abortion during the campaign. In an appearance before Wauconda Township Republicans on Oct. 2, 2013, Rauner said: "Abortion is a tragedy. It’s a loss of life. To me that’s not debatable. However, I do not advocate making it illegal. I can’t, I won’t, I’m not going to talk about making it illegal. I’m going to work and support efforts to make it safe and rare. Parental notification, late-term restrictions, teaching abstinence outside of marriage and strongly encouraging adoption as a far better alternative." To residents of HeatherRidge community in Gurnee on Nov. 3, 2013: "The reality is the right for a woman to choose is the national law and we’re not gonna, that ain’t gonna change in Illinois. I think we can agree on some common-sense ways where abortion can be more rare and safe. I support parental notification. I support late-term restrictions. I strongly encourage adoption as a far better alternative to abortion. There are things we can agree on to work on to try and get done, realistically… "I just think it’s better for a woman and her physician and her family and her minister or priest make the decision than the government. That’s my view. People can disagree with me. I respect that. But that’s my view, it ain’t gonna change." It came up in an interview on the "Big John and Amy Show" on WIND-AM 560 on March 17, 2014: Amy Jacobson: "If there was a possibility that the decision was passed from federal to state jurisdiction, what would your position be?" Rauner: "My position would be abortion is a tragedy but it should be an issue left to a woman with her physician and her family and her minister, not the government." Diana’s role It wasn’t just the candidate himself proclaiming his "pro-choice" bona fides during the campaign. Diana Rauner, head of the child advocacy concern the Ounce of Prevention Fund, became a strong spokeswoman for her husband’s no-social-agenda agenda, especially where it concerned reproductive rights. "You can trust him that there’s no way he will ever let anything happen to our reproductive rights," Diana Rauner said in an interview with NBC5 political reporter Mary Ann Ahern on Sept. 26, 2014. "I actually think this is a great opportunity in this race where we actually don’t have to think about the social issues because both candidates are pro-choice." The campaign featured a 30-second TV ad in which Diana, who claimed to be a Democrat, sought to bring Democrats to her husband’s side by telling viewers, "Bruce doesn't have a social agenda. He has an economic and educational agenda." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com After an Oct. 24, 2014, event in Chicago in which feminist icon Gloria Steinem endorsed Quinn and accused Rauner of financially supporting anti-abortion causes and candidates. "In terms of money and action, he is, in fact, anti-choice," Steinem said during her appearance with Quinn. Diana Rauner provided the response in an interview with then ABC-7 political reporter Charles Thomas. "Bruce has a strong history of being a supporter of reproductive rights," she said. "He’s a social moderate and he’s committed to education and has shown that commitment over the years." Opposition message Throughout the campaign, Rauner found himself in the strange position of being a Republican candidate forced to deny charges that he opposed abortion. Despite Rauner’s many statements to the contrary, the Quinn campaign sought to portray Rauner as a major funder of anti-abortion candidates and organizations. The Chicago Tribune story on Steinem’s appearance carried this rebuttal from Rauner’s campaign: "Rauner campaign aides said the candidate and wife Diana have donated money to abortion rights groups including Planned Parenthood and the Roger Baldwin Foundation." The Baldwin Foundation is a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union that litigates issues including reproductive rights. At the same time, however, Rauner was a heavy donor to Republican candidates and state and national Republican organizations that were firmly in the anti-abortion camp. Chicago Magazine detailed the political/ideological conflict of the Rauners in an article published the day before the 2014 election headlined, "Is Bruce Rauner Pro-Choice, Anti-Choice, or Just an Opportunist?" (I)t’s interesting to look at the self-proclaimed Democrat, Diana, who has given in 2014 the max in the primary and/or general to several Republicans, some who are decidedly not socially moderate... Just a couple of examples: David McSweeney (abortion and gay marriage opponent), Mark Neerhof (against gay marriage). Diana has also given generously ($10,000 in 2012; $5,300 this time around) to the Republican Renaissance PAC of the late ultra-conservative Jack Roeser (anti abortion, anti gay marriage). Bruce has a much more extensive record of contributions—including $27.6 million to himself, $5 million to the state Republican party, and also, along with Diana, donations to McSweeney, Neerhof, and to Roeser’s PAC. (Roeser, who died last June, was an early Rauner backer and a member of his gubernatorial exploratory committee.) Considering the contradictory nature of the Rauners’ donations -- giving heavily to groups that support abortion rights and also to political candidates and organizations that oppose them -- it’s reasonable to believe that some anti-abortion voters might have inferred anti-abortion leanings in candidate Rauner. But we found no evidence of Rauner himself attempting to hide his true stance. No status quo In 2014, campaigning on maintaining the status quo on abortion was a viable option. State finances were a wreck and there appeared to be little pressure either way to change the state’s laws on abortion. The election of Donald Trump, who stated an intent to overturn Roe v. Wade and turn the question of abortion’s legality back to the states, changed that overnight. Almost immediately, Democrats in the Illinois General Assembly began advancing a bill to both keep abortion legal should Roe v. Wade be overturned and provide insurance coverage for it under Medicaid and Illinois’ state employee health insurance. "I look at it as an insurance parity issue. There’s no excuse about the cost," Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, said in December 2016. By packaging the trigger language and the expanded insurance coverage into a single bill, supporters of what became HB 40 effectively boxed Rauner by forcing the no-social-agenda governor to pick a side in the culture wars. He would infuriate pro-choice voters by either vetoing the bill outright or issuing an amendatory veto to strike the abortion insurance provision, the practical effect of which would be to kill the measure anyway. But signing HB 40 would be sure to antagonize much his Republican base, much of which remains passionately opposed to abortion. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com This was something Rauner had worked throughout the spring to avoid, at times sending out mixed signals about how he intended to handle the bill if lawmakers sent it to his desk. He made public statements in April promising to veto the bill as written. When he broke that promise, he faced the wrath of everyone from rank-and-file Republican lawmakers to Chicago Cardinal Blaise Cupich. Rauner, speaking haltingly and appearing physically uncomfortable, explained at his signing press conference that adding government funded insurance coverage was consistent with his pro-choice beliefs. "I also believe that no woman should be forced to make a different decision than another woman make purely based on her income," Rauner said. "I believe that a woman living with limited financial means should not be put in a position where she has to choose something different than a woman of higher income would be able to choose." Our ruling Bruce Rauner said his signing of a controversial abortion bill was consistent with his pro-choice principles and that he had never presented himself as anything but pro-choice. We looked through numerous campaign appearance videos, ads and news stories and found no evidence that Rauner ever tried to hide or downplay his pro-choice beliefs. In fact, his campaign touted the Rauners’ support of abortion rights groups to rebut the charge that he was not pro-choice. Rauner sought anti-abortion voters by assuring them that, as governor, he had no social agenda and that "the right for a woman to choose is the national law and… that ain’t gonna change in Illinois." Politically, it proved to be a smart strategy that helped gain him election in 2014. By 2017, however, it became impossible to continue finessing the issue. In picking a side, Rauner declared that he has been consistent in declaring his pro-choice beliefs. We rate that statement True.

pomt-12028	Says Roy Moore is "on the wrong side of Trump’s border wall."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/18/senate-leadership-fund/gop-super-pac-says-alabamas-roy-moore-doesnt-back-/	If top Republicans in Washington have their way, Alabama Republican Roy Moore won’t be the GOP Senate nominee. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have both come out for Moore’s chief opponent, Luther Strange. In the latest salvo, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by McConnell’s former chief of staff, aired an ad that essentially tells viewers that Moore opposes Trump’s wall along the Mexican border. Here’s the full text: Male voice: "Who will fight with President Trump to change Washington? Not career politician Roy Moore. He’s on the wrong side of Trump’s border wall." Video clip of Moore: "I’ll tell you a little secret. Does it take a wall?" Video clip of Moore: "I don’t think it would take a wall." Repeats the same clip of Moore: "I don’t think it would take a wall." Male voice: "Roy Moore. Dead wrong on President Trump’s wall to protect our borders." Audio clip of Moore: "You can’t build a wall around our country." This is a case where the individual elements of the ad hold up, but the package deal paints an incomplete picture. The ad uses video selectively. A good example comes from the rest of Moore’s words at the forum where he said, "I don’t think it would take a wall." Here’s a more complete excerpt of his remarks: "I think we need something to stop illegal aliens flowing across our borders, because they are a danger to our republic, a danger to our homes, our families, and we can do something," Moore said at the Wetumpka T.E.A. Party candidate forum on July 31. "I support using federal troops (and the) National Guard to stop this." A moment later, he continued, "If it takes a wall, we should build it. I don't think it would take a wall. I think we should use the United States military." In an Aug. 15 radio interview, Moore expressed impatience with the pace of fortifying the border. "Here we are, waiting since November and nothing’s been done in stopping illegal aliens," Moore said. "It can be stopped within days by the U.S. military ... We need to stop illegal aliens coming in and then, if a wall is necessary and we’ve got the money, we can build it." Moore’s campaign website says, "We must allow willing states (like Arizona) to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, and use our own military to protect our border. If a wall is our only option, then we should build it immediately." Chris Pack, a spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, said Moore’s stance is at variance with Trump’s position. "Roy Moore has repeatedly said he doesn’t think we need a wall and that it should be ‘the last recourse,’ or as ‘the last thing we need to do,’ "Pack said. "President Trump, by contrast, has called the wall ‘absolutely necessary,’ ‘so vital,’ and ‘very, very important.’ " Pack went on to say, "Our ad is simply pointing out that Roy Moore is not with Trump in pushing for the wall." Advocates of the wall argue that, unlike a military deployment, it would be a barrier that would outlast any change in leadership or policy in Washington. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund ad describes Moore as being on the "wrong side of Trump’s border wall." Based on that and the clips in the ad, most viewers might reasonably think that means Moore is against a wall. In fact, Moore doesn’t want to wait and would rather deploy the American military immediately to secure the border with Mexico. If after that a wall is needed, he said the country should build it. What we have is more of a difference on tactics, not overall strategy or outcomes. The ad makes it sound like the gap is more than that. The ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts the would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14314	Says the GOP is "helping pay for" Justice Rebecca Bradley's campaign and "she recently skipped court to attend an event paid for" by Scott Walker's "lobbyist friends."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/31/joanne-kloppenburg/gop-helping-pay-campaign-wisconsin-supreme-court-j/	One of the knocks against Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley is that she was elevated quickly to the high court because of her ties to state Republicans, particularly Gov. Scott Walker. State Court of Appeals Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who is challenging Bradley in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election, produced a TV ad that hits on that theme. The ad, released March 15, 2016, claims the Republican Party "is helping pay for" Bradley's campaign and that Bradley "recently skipped court to attend an event paid for" by Walker’s "lobbyist friends." Skipped court is an exaggeration. But the other two parts of Kloppenburg’s claim are on target. GOP help Kloppenburg's campaign cited a Bradley campaign report filed with the state that lists contributions received in January 2016. The state GOP made $8,242 in in-kind contributions, for robo-calls and for wages for its own staff. Meanwhile, the Clark County Republican Party gave $100 in cash and the Dane County GOP $20 in cash, Bradley reported. Another Bradley report showed the Washington County GOP in December 2015 gave $500 in cash and $400 in in-kind donations, for food and beverages at a fundraising event. So, in total, the state and county GOP party organizations have given a total of $9,262 in cash and in-kind contributions to Bradley’s campaign. (According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign finances, through Feb. 1, 2016 Bradley had raised a total of $317,792 and Kloppenburg had raisaed $335,693.) Bradley’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information for this fact check. Also in December 2015, ahead of the three-way primary in February 2016, the chairman of the state Republican Party, Brad Courtney, sent a mass email seeking volunteers to help gather signatures for Bradley. To get on the ballot, the candidates needed at least 2,000 signatures. (While Bradley is widely acknowledged as politically conservative, Kloppenburg is widely regarded as liberal, in part because of $18,000 in contributions her campaign has received from the Madison teachers union and because she has made contributions over the years to Democratic candidates.) 'Skipped court' The part of the claim that says Bradley skipped court exaggerates what happened. The Supreme Court was hearing oral arguments in a case on Feb. 24, 2016 and Bradley left about 15 minutes early. She did not miss an entire session, as the Kloppenburg claim suggests. A Bradley campaign spokeswoman said at the time that Bradley reviewed the briefs and did not have any other questions on the case when she left the arguments. Bradley left so she could speak to an annual gathering put on by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobbying group and a heavy spender in past court races. Conservative Justice Michael Gableman also left the arguments early to attend the event. Liberal justice Ann Walsh said at the time it is rare for justices to leave oral arguments early. But it was later reported she had left oral arguments 30 minutes early in February 2015 in order to speak to the Wisconsin Counties Association as part of her own re-election campaign. 'Lobbyist friends' Bradley was appointed to the Supreme Court in October 2015 by Walker, five months after he appointed her to the Court of Appeals. Walker also put Bradley on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, in 2012, and she later won election to that judgeship. Walker has long enjoyed the backing of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce. Two examples: A WMC executive was a member of Walker’s transition team after Walker was elected in 2010. The conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth -- whom Walker had urged donors to give to -- gave $2.5 million to WMC, which in turn ran ads promoting Walker when he fended off a recall in 2012. Our rating Kloppenburg says the GOP "is helping pay for" Bradley's campaign and "she recently skipped court to attend an event paid for by" Walker's "lobbyist friends." The state and county Republican parties have given $9,262 in cash and in-kind contributions to Bradley's campaign. She didn't entirely skip court one day, but did leave oral arguments the Supreme Court was hearing early in order to speak at a Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce event. WMC, the state's largest business lobby, is a major supporter of Walker. We rate Kloppenburg's statement Mostly True. (Note: This item was updated to clarify that in-kind contributions from the state GOP paid for wages for its own staff, not for Bradley's campaign staff.)

pomt-10699	MikeHuckabee.com gets "more hits than virtually any other presidential candidate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/03/mike-huckabee/its-no-myspace-but-its-hot/	A November 2007 poll has Mike Huckabee leading Republicans in Iowa, putting fear into his big-name presidential opponents. That mirrors his popularity on the Web, where he has the right to crow. Since Nov. 17, Ron Paul has been the only candidate to get more Internet traffic than the former governor of Arkansas. Huckabee's site beat out front-runners Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Rudy Giuliani. Huckabee gets credit for choosing his words carefully. By saying his site gets more hits than "virtually" any other candidate, he keeps it just vague enough to avoid running into trouble. Huckabee's online fame has been growing slowly for weeks. In September, less than 10 percent of Web users who went to presidential campaign sites checked out Huckabee's site, according to Hitwise.com, which uses a sample of 10-million Web users to track traffic to all types of Internet sites. By mid November, visits to Huckabee's site outnumbered every other candidate but Paul, according to Hitwise. On Nov. 24, nearly 19 percent of Web visitors who went to campaign sites checked out Huckabee's site. That same week, about 26 percent visited Paul's site. Obama was third, with 10 percent. MikeHuckabee.com features an online store, where supporters can buy T-shirts and baby bibs that read "I Like Mike." There's also a Webisode where actor Chuck Norris discusses why he endorsed Huckabee. So, why the new popularity? "Mike Huckabee is now being talked about as a possible winner of Iowa and people are now interested in him," said Joshua Levy, associate editor of www.techpresident.com. "The Republicans aren't that satisfied with their slate. Rudy Giuliani is a really unorthodox candidate for that base. Mitt Romney isn't really inspiring. So you got this guy, Mike Huckabee, who has been inching towards the top for a while. He is getting a lot of buzz in general." Huckabee's success on the Web could also be attributed to voter curiosity. For the most part, Giuliani, Clinton and Obama are well-known figures whose stories have been paraded in the press for years. No need to Google them. Huckabee is not as familiar, so interested voters are going to check out his site. "It's been a long year," said Julie Barko Germany, deputy director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University. "So fresh faces like Ron Paul and Huckabee are starting to get a little more attention." While www.mikehuckabee.com might never share the same celebrity as www.myspace.com or www.thefacebook.com, for now Huckabee has the right to brag about his Web popularity. Given his use of the word "virtually," we give him a ruling of True.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2007-12-03T00:00:00	2007-11-14	['None']

pomt-07761	If there’s a government shutdown, "people don’t get their Social Security checks."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-if-theres-government-shutdown-so/	With President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans on a potential collision course over the federal budget, the possibility of a government shutdown is closer than it’s been in years. Shutdowns occur when appropriations bills expire and Congress and the president are at an impasse. A shutdown typically prevents federal agencies from carrying out any functions deemed non-essential. A shutdown last occurred in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. That led to two shutdowns -- one for five days in November 1995 and the other for 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996. During the past 15 years, lawmakers and the president, despite frequent turbulence, have always managed to come to an agreement on funding bills. But the streak could come to an end this year. At a Feb. 15, 2011, press conference, a reporter asked Obama whether he was willing to work with Congressional Republicans "to avoid a government shutdown?" Here’s part of Obama’s answer: "We’ve got to be careful. Again, let’s use a scalpel; let’s not use a machete. And if we do that, there should be no reason at all for a government shutdown. And I think people should be careful about being too loose in terms of talking about a government shutdown, because this has -- this is not an abstraction. People don’t get their Social Security checks. They don’t get their veterans payments. Basic functions shut down. And it -- that, also, would have an adverse effect on our economic recovery. It would be destabilizing at a time when, I think, everybody is hopeful that we can start growing this economy quicker." A reader asked us to explore whether it was true that Americans won’t get their Social Security checks if the government shuts down. First, some background about the laws that govern shutdowns, from a recent briefing paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The Constitution (Article I, Sec. 9) says, "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." This is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law and which has been revised significantly over the years. That act prohibits federal officials from spending money before an appropriations measure has been enacted, though exceptions exist for "emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property." But when looking at the fate of Social Security during a government shutdown, there’s an important wrinkle to remember. Social Security is a mandatory program supported by a trust fund. As such, Social Security benefits aren’t appropriated -- and thus aren’t directly subject to the restrictions of the Antideficiency Act. However, the Social Security Administration’s operational employees are paid through appropriated funds. So the real question is whether a shutdown would prevent those employees from going to work, and if so, whether that would mean the payments wouldn't be sent. A 1981 attorney general's opinion protects the right of at least some Social Security workers to carry out necessary functions -- and that’s essentially what happened during the 1995 shutdowns. According to Social Security's official history on its website, 4,780 employees remained at work at the start of the four-day shutdown, while the other 61,415 were furloughed. But this cut "significantly impacted the Agency’s service to the public," the account said, and on the second day, additional employees were recalled to work. The second shutdown -- which lasted three weeks, the longest in history -- could have brought even more severe consequences. But the agency deployed 55,000 employees and operations remained close to normal. (Experts told us it’s possible that the agency could get by with fewer employees today than in 1995 because today, many Social Security benefits are paid electronically.) So, in 1995, the bottom line was that checks went out pretty much as they were supposed to. Does that mean they will if there’s a shutdown this year? White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed the question during his Feb. 24, 2011, press briefing. Asked by a reporter why checks might not go out in 2011 like they did in 1995, Carney suggested that at least some beneficiaries may not be able to receive adequate customer services during a shutdown due to workers being furloughed. "The president was pointing out some of the consequences, the potential consequences of failing to act, of failing to prevent a shutdown," Carney said. "And some recipients, new retirees, new applicants might not receive their checks. If retirees have questions about their checks, if they didn't get their check in the mail, if they had a change of address, all those things could prevent them from getting their checks. So there are, obviously, consequences that directly affect people who are recipients of Social Security benefits." This statement -- which is noticeably more nuanced than Obama’s original comment -- comes close to the assessments of experts we spoke to. They told us it’s likely that payments will once again be made -- but there’s no guarantee. As CRS put it, while "past experience may inform future OMB and agency decisions," past precedents on activities and personnel "would not necessarily hold for any future shutdown." Experts told us that there is enough of a gray area that it’s impossible to say with certainty that checks will go out during the next shutdown. The president and Congress "could decide whether to send out Social Security checks in the event of a shutdown," said Alice Rivlin, who headed OMB under Clinton. "Congress could mandate that enough workers be declared 'essential' to get the checks out or the president could decide to take that action—or not." John Palguta, a former federal official who is now vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, agreed, saying that it’s "probable" that Social Security payments will continue, but added that "it’s not an iron-clad guarantee." So at the very least, we believe there’s considerably more uncertainty on this issue than Obama stated in the news conference. While Obama had said that if there’s a government shutdown, "people don’t get their Social Security checks," the reality is that the law provides significant leeway for employing federal workers to carry out Social Security functions during a shutdown, which allowed most checks to go out in 1995. On the other hand, making that approach work depends on the president utilizing his authority, and on Congress not blocking him from carrying it out. It’s also possible, as Carney suggests, that depending on the number of Social Security employees assigned to work, certain customer services may become unavailable during a shutdown, such as checks not going out to new beneficiaries or those with address changes. Ultimately, the law and history suggest that it’s likely that checks will go out, though it’s not a certainty. On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08844	"Last year, we borrowed $1.4 trillion -- or 41 cents of every dollar we spent. Over half of this debt is held by foreign investors."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/10/george-voinovich/sen-george-voinovich-critical-half-national-debt-h/	Want to invest in U.S. Treasury notes? Step right up, alongside China, Japan, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. While a sign of faith in the stability of the U.S. dollar, all this money from foreigners also worries some people. They say the nearly $4 trillion worth of U.S. government securities held by foreign investors shows how deeply our government must borrow to sustain itself – and if the foreign investors want out, they could harm our economy. U.S. Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio is among the worriers, and he blames this government’s inability to stop spending. As he said on the floor of the Senate on July 14, "Last year, we borrowed $1.4 trillion -- or 41 cents of every dollar we spent. Over half of this debt is held by foreign investors." Has the share of debt to foreigners really gotten that big? If you use a widely accepted estimate agreed to by economists, yes. How worrisome that is, and why, is another matter. The debt to which he refers is not just from last year’s $1.4 trillion budget deficit. The debt is the total of all outstanding borrowing. Think of it like a 30-year home mortgage of $150,000 and a home equity loan of $25,000. The total debt would be $175,000 plus interest, even if only $1,200 a month, or $14,400, was due this year. Total U.S. government debt as of July 30 was nearly $13.25 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. But about $4.5 trillion of that debt is what’s called "intragovernmental holdings" -- money loaned from one government agency to another. This includes money that the Social Security trust fund loaned to the Treasury for general government operations that eventually will have to be repaid. Economists often exclude intragovernmental holdings when discussing the public debt, because their bigger concern is the other portion -- $8.7 trillion – that will have to be repaid to outside parties. The government gets that money from investors -- individuals, companies, mutual funds and foreign countries -- in exchange for interest-bearing bills, notes and bonds from the Treasurery Department. This "Debt Held By the Public" is what Voinovich was referring to when he said that "over half this debt is held by foreign investors." So how is his math? If you want precision, it’ll depend on which report you are examining. According to Treasury Department information that is updated monthly, foreigners held $3.96 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities at the end of May (the most recent month reported). The total debt to the public was nearly $8.5 trillion. So foreign ownership of U.S. debt equaled 47 percent if you use the May data. Voinovich’s aides said the senator used slightly different numbers from a quarterly Treasury report from the end of March. It listed foreign and international ownership of U.S. Treasury securities at $3.88 trillion. At the time, total public debt was listed as $7.5 trillion. That meant 52 percent of the public debt was held by foreign investors. Given the daily swings in market valuation and debt, changes in foreign countries’ investments, and even small changes in the way that different Treasury documents account for holdings, it makes little difference if the right figure is 47 percent of 52 percent. Voinovich is basically correct. Likewise, even though Voinovich’s claim excluded the portion of national debt that comprises intragovernmental holdings, economists say his framework is widely accepted. "I don’t think he was straying from conventional usage in saying that," said Andrew Biggs, a resident scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Where are these foreign investors from? China represented 22 percent of the foreign holders at the end of May, with $867.7 billion, followed by Japan ($786.7 billion, or 20 percent), the United Kingdom ($350 billion, or 9 percent) and oil exporting countries ($235.1 billion, or 6 percent). Economists and politicians sometimes dispute what would happen if these investors suddenly cashed in their investments. Theoretically it could harm the value of the U.S. dollar, require higher interest rates to attract new investors, lead to high inflation and drive up the cost of consumer goods for Americans.. But that could hurt the value of their investments in a sell-off. And a weaker American dollar would make American goods more affordable overseas while foreign goods got more expensive here. That’s not what countries selling to American consumers want, economists say. That doesn’t mean the current level of debt is insignificant, and the subject consumes a great deal of this year’s political debate. The foreign-ownership component leaves a number if "what-ifs" on which people disagree. But we found that Voinovich’s numbers are basically sound, and economists we talked to agreed it’s fine for Voinovich to cite only the publicly held debt for his comparison. We rate Voinovich’s claim that half the national debt is held by foreign investors as True.	None	George Voinovich	None	None	None	2010-08-10T11:00:00	2010-07-14	['None']

pomt-08251	"It is a commitment voters take very seriously: The only incumbent in Ohio to break his Pledge and vote for Ted Strickland's income tax hike was defeated soundly on Tuesday."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/12/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-lone-ohio-incumbent-break-tax-/	Americans for Tax Reform is becoming a force to be reckoned with in American politics. The anti-tax group, headed by conservative Grover Norquist, came up with a simple anti-tax pledge that became a must-sign for Republicans across the country running for Congress. The pledge says that the signer will "oppose and vote against any and all efforts to raise taxes" and it was signed by those running from all kinds of offices from local races right on up to gubernatorial races across America. In Ohio, the pledge was signed by GOP Congressional candidates galore as well as trio of Republicans who won statewide office on Nov. 2 -- Secretary of State-elect Jon Husted, State Auditor-elect David Yost and Gov.-elect John Kasich. It was also signed by at least 22 Republicans who will be in the Ohio House, including the incoming House Speaker Bill Batchelder, a Medina Republican who comes into power after flipping at least a dozen seats (two seats still have automatic recounts on the way) to gain a 58-person majority in the 99-member chamber. Hoping to trumpet the success of anti-tax candidates, Americans for Tax Reform put out a news release congratulating Kasich and Batchelder for their Election Day success. In the release, they attempt to underscore the consequences for those who violate the pledge. "It is a commitment voters take very seriously: The only incumbent in Ohio to break his Pledge and vote for Ted Strickland's income tax hike was defeated soundly on Tuesday." Because the pledge appears to be growing in popularity with the conservatives running all branches of state government, PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at this claim. The incumbent the anti-tax group is referring to is the only House Democratic candidate to sign the pledge Rep. Dan Dodd of Hebron. And Dodd most assuredly did vote for Strickland's plan to push back the final year of a planned income tax cut -- what the anti-tax group and Republicans across Ohio say amounts to a tax hike. However, it's a little stretch to say he was beaten "soundly," as Dodd lost by about 3.8 percent in his run against Republican Bill Hayes. Libertarian candidate Chad Ricketts polled a surprising 10 percent in the race to finish third. Dodd trailed Hayes by about 1,500 votes in a race with more than 42,000 votes cast. What the Americans for Tax Reform doesn't tell you is that the anti-tax pledge was no guarantee of success in Ohio legislative races. In fact, more than 60 percent of the Ohio legislative candidates who took the pledge lost their races. To be fair, many were third-party candidates or Republicans running in overwhelmingly Democratic districts. To sum up: Americans for Tax Reform claimed the only incumbent to break the group's no-new taxes pledge was defeated "soundly" on Nov. 2. And while it's true that Hebron Democratic Rep. Dan Dodd was the only one to break the pledge, he lost by less than 4 percentage points. We find that to be less than "soundly." As a result, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14795	President Barack Obama "wants to take in 250,000 (people) from Syria."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/dec/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-president-obama-wants-us-take-25/	Donald Trump, the hard-charging businessman who had been leading voter polls for the Republican presidential nomination, recently kicked off a rally in Beaumont with a moment of silence for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks that left at least 129 dead. In the aftermath of the attacks, conflicting reports on the citizenship status of the perpetrators led 30 state governors and most of the Republican presidential candidates, including Trump, to speak out against Syrian refugees entering the United States. Trump began his Nov. 14, 2015, speech at Beaumont’s Ford Park Arena by calling the events in Paris the night before "terrible." He went on to say, "And when you look at what happened in that case, it’s just reported, one from Syria. And our president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria," citing one of the Paris attacker’s alleged Syrian nationality. While the Syrian passport allegedly found next to the body of one of the attackers is believed to be fake and at least six out of the 10 known assailants are European nationals, Trump and others cited the Paris attacks as good reason to prohibit additional Syrian refugees from entering the United States. Trump was not alone in claiming President Barack Obama wants to allow hundreds of thousands of Syrians entry to the United States. Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina put the number at 100,000 Syrian refugees and Ben Carson likened bringing 200,000 people "from that region" to malpractice. Trump had used the 250,000 figure before, telling Matt Lauer of NBC News he didn’t want that many Syrians coming to the United States. The United States has a long history of taking in refugees from war-torn countries, including some from Syria. But has President Obama decided to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees? Our attempts to learn the basis for Trump’s statement yielded no replies from his campaign. In October 2015, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity made a claim much like the one Trump offered in Beaumont, though Hannity mentioned another country as well, saying: "The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country." Pants on Fire, PolitiFact ruled a week later, finding that Hannity lofted a figure not rooted in Obama administration plans, though there are plans to admit more refugees, including more Syrians, over several years. Hannity offered as backup for his claim a Sept. 20, 2015, Associated Press news story stating that the U.S. will accept 85,000 refugees from around the world next year, up from 70,000, and that total would rise to 100,000 in 2017, per Secretary of State John Kerry’s remarks. Hannity added up the total number of refugees allowed each year from all over the world, to get a total of 255,000 refugees. That AP story, however, said that those figures reflected refugees to be welcomed from around the world, not just Syria or even the Middle East. On Sept. 10, 2015, the Obama administration announced plans to increase the number of Syrian refugees to at least 10,000, although talk radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh have claimed figures almost 10 times as high. We reached out to the White House for clarity. White House spokesman Eric Schultz sent back an email stating that the U.S. is increasing the "number of Syrian and other refugees we admit from around the world on an annual basis," going up to 85,000 next year and 100,000 the following year. While Hannity further clarified his statement, that he didn’t say all would be Syrian refugees, Trump explicitly labeled all 250,000 as Syrian refugees. After searching other news stories, checking with the White House and searching some more, we did find that 250,000 figure out there on the Internet -- on a parody site called Real News Right Now, which stated: "The U.S. Department of State announced today that it will grant upwards of two-hundred and fifty thousand Syrian refugees temporary amnesty in the United States. Over the next four months, State Department officials working in conjunction with FEMA will begin processing and transporting the refugees to sparsely populated parts of Arizona and North Dakota." It went on to quote Cathy Pieper, a spokesperson for the "Department of State," the article said. We called the State Department to see if there was a spokesperson by that name; there isn’t. Refugee resettlement In September 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry shared the Obama administration’s plans to increase the total number of refugees coming into the United States from all countries from 70,000 to 85,000 in Fiscal Year 2016, with "10,000 over the next year from Syria specifically," Kerry said. The following year, Kerry said the target would be closer to 100,000 total, again from all countries. Between Oct. 1, 2011 and Nov. 20, 2015, the U.S. resettled 2,261 Syrian refugees in 36 states, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes migration across the world. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the organization, wrote in an email that between the Obama administration’s announcement of accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 (part of the total increase to 85,000 refugees) and the plan to raise the overall refugee admissions ceiling in FY 2017 to 100,000, even if the entirety of the increase between Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017 were all Syrian refugees (the allotted number for Syrian refugees hasn’t been specified), that would permit admission of 25,000 Syrian refugees in FY 2017. "We know of no proposal by the administration to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees," she said. According to a report submitted to Congress Oct. 1, 2015, the U.S. admitted between 1,600 and 1,800 Syrian refugees in FY 2015. The table below, from the Proposed Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2016 report to Congress includes the number of actual arrivals for 2014 and 2015 from all areas of the world, and projected numbers for 2016: Table I Refugee Admissions in FY 2014 and FY 2015 Proposed Refugee Admissions by Region for FY 2016[3] Region FY 2014 Actual arrivals FY 2015 Ceiling Revised FY 2015 Ceiling FY 2015 projected arrivals Proposed FY2016 Ceiling Africa 17,476 17,000 20,400 22,600 25,000 East Asia 14,784 13,000 17,300 18,200 13,000 Europe and Central Asia 959 1,000 2,300 2,350 4,000 Latin America/Caribbean 4,318 4,000 2,300 2,050 3,000 Near East/South Asia 32,450 33,000 27,700 24,800 34,000 Regional Subtotal 69,987 68,000 70,000 70,000 79,000 Unallocated Reserve 2,000 6,000 Total 69,987 70,000 70,000 70,000 85,000 Our ruling Trump said President Obama wants to take in 250,000 people from Syria. If so, neither the administration or any other authoritative source had said as much before Trump stumped in Beaumont.

Chris Christie likes to tell people how New Jersey leads the nation or comes close in various fiscal categories, but when it comes to Medicaid spending, the Republican issued the wrong diagnosis. During the June 16 broadcast of On the Line, host Steve Adubato was pressing Christie about why the governor wouldn’t support a tax increase for higher income earners. Adubato argued that revenue could support health benefits for struggling families. Christie said New Jersey already faces high taxes and offered this extra dose of reasoning: "We have the second-richest Medicaid program in America. Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey. Steve, at some point, we have to say no to certain things." PolitiFact New Jersey found that New Jersey’s Medicaid expenses in recent years were higher than most of the country, but not as high as Christie said they were. According to three separate analyses -- covering the current federal fiscal year and the two previous ones -- New Jersey has ranked ninth each time in overall state spending on Medicaid. A Christie spokesman later pointed to older fiscal year numbers to back up the governor’s statement. Based on data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, two analyses were performed by PolitiFact New Jersey and the other by the California-based Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy. First, let’s start with the older numbers. According to the foundation’s website -- www.statehealthfacts.org-- the state share of Medicaid spending in New Jersey between October 2008 and September 2009 was about $3.9 billion, putting it in ninth place among the 50 states and Washington, D.C. A similar result turned up when we looked at more recent numbers. Tony Salters, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, provided us with data on Medicaid expenses from fiscal year 2010 as well as the first two quarters of fiscal year 2011. Based on that data, New Jersey ranked ninth among the states for overall state spending on Medicaid between October 2009 and September 2010. For the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, New Jersey also ranked ninth among the states, according to the federal data. In each of the three fiscal years, the states ahead of New Jersey were New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts and Ohio, according to the federal data. If we go further back and look at a different measure, New Jersey still doesn’t rank second. Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, said he prefers the measure of total Medicaid spending per person below the federal poverty level. Based on that measure, New Jersey ranked 13th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in federal and state spending combined in federal fiscal year 2008, Cantor said. After being presented with some of our findings, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak pointed to a different analysis performed by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That analysis shows that New Jersey ranked second among the states behind Alaska in Medicaid payments per adult in federal fiscal year 2007. Those payments represent federal and state shares. "Of course, who we are second to is less relevant than the essential point that this is one more area where New Jersey ranked near the top in something (like taxes), and not in a good way," Drewniak wrote in an email. But Medicaid payments for adults accounted for about 8 percent of total payments in New Jersey in federal fiscal year 2007, marking the smallest percentage among four enrollment groups, according to the foundation. When we look at per-person payments for elderly and disabled residents -- the two largest groups benefiting from Medicaid funding -- New Jersey ranked 16th and fifth, respectively, among the 50 states and Washington, D.C., according to the foundation. Let’s review: In discussing his opposition to raising taxes on higher income earners, Christie said, "Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey." Yet federal data going back nearly three years has shown that New Jersey consistently ranks ninth in overall state spending on Medicaid. A Christie spokesman said New Jersey ranked second behind Alaska in payments per adult, but the least amount of Medicaid payments went towards that enrollment group. New Jersey lands in the top ten for Medicaid spending in many cases, but the governor was wrong in his specific assertion that New Jersey ranked second. We rate Christie’s statement False.

pomt-10749	"It's just outrageous that under President Bush, the National Institutes of Health have been basically decreased in funding."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/02/hillary-clinton/nih-funding-is-up-under-bush/	At a Democratic debate in Philadelphia, Sen. Hillary Clinton was asked what she would do as president to fight cancer. As part of her answer, she said, "It's just outrageous that under President Bush, the National Institutes of Health have been basically decreased in funding. We are on the brink of so many medical breakthroughs, and I will once again fund that research." Her claim about the funding of NIH is not accurate, no matter how you slice the numbers. Regardless of which years you choose to compare, or whether the numbers are adjusted for inflation, funding went up. In non-inflation-adjusted dollars, funding increased. Bush requested $28.9 billion dollars in net budget authority for fiscal 2008 (the year that began Oct. 1, 2007), and the agency received an estimated $28.6 billion in fiscal 2007. Either of these numbers is greater than when Bush came into office -- $20.6 billion in fiscal 2001, the last year for which Clinton presided over the congressional budgeting process, or $17.8 billion in fiscal 2000, the last full fiscal year Clinton was in office. The numbers tell the same tale for net outlays, with an estimated $28.1 billion in fiscal 2007 compared with $17.3 billion and $15.4 billion for fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increases aren't as large when the numbers are adjusted for inflation. But they still went up. In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, the Clinton campaign provided two newspaper stories that said the NIH budget had been flat since 2003. We acknowledge that is accurate, but we still find funding has gone up during Bush's presidency. We find her statement to be False.

pomt-00082	Says "Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress" and "is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/01/duncan-hunter-2/did-cair-muslim-brotherhood-back-democratic-candid/	The U.S. House race in California’s 50th district has gotten nasty. Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter represents a solidly Republican district, but he was indicted in August for misusing campaign funds. This has given a boost to his previously longshot Democratic challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, who is of Palestinian and Mexican ancestry. A recent poll by the independent firm SurveyUSA had Hunter with only a three-point lead. Hunter has attracted national attention — and criticism — for rhetoric that seeks to paint Campa-Najjar as someone who has ties to Islamist terrorists. "Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress," says one ad by Hunter’s campaign. "He’s used three different names to hide his family’s ties to terrorism. His grandfather masterminded the Munich Olympic massacre. His father said they deserved to die." The ad then plays video aired by the conservative One America News Network: "A Palestinian-Mexican American doesn’t get his support from the people of San Diego.’ ‘He is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.’ ‘This is a well-orchestrated plan.’" The ad closes, "Ammar Campa-Najjar: A risk we can’t ignore." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Washington Post Fact Checker looked at various elements of this ad as well as separate remarks delivered by Hunter and gave them a collective Four Pinocchios, the worst possible rating. (Campa-Najjar, for instance, never knew his grandfather, his father’s comment was not that straightforward, and he was raised by his mother’s Mexican-American family.) Here, we’ll zero in on one particular claim in the advertisement — that Campa-Najjar "is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood." CAIR refers to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based group whose mission is to "enhance understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims. The assertion about the support for Campa-Najjar’s campaign is not accurate. Despite Hunter’s continued invocation of radical Islam in the campaign, Campa-Najjar is actually a Christian of long standing. In a statement provided by Campa-Najjar’s campaign, Mike Meeks, pastor emeritus of EastLake Church, said, "I have known Ammar since he was 16, when he became part of our youth ministry. Before he left for college, he grew up serving our janitorial staff, worship team, and youth ministry, where he even gave Sunday Youth group sermons. When he served in federal government, we talked regularly about life and the faith challenges of following Jesus in today’s world. Through it all, Ammar remains committed to growing in his faith, following Jesus and serving his community." Campa-Najjar’s campaign said that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization in Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries, would deem him an apostate due to his Christianity. Furthermore, neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor CAIR are legally able to support a candidate. Over the years, the United States’ relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood has ranged from uneasy tolerance to outright opposition. But whatever the U.S. policy has been, the Muslim Brotherhood is a foreign organization, so as such, the group and its leaders are prohibited by federal law from making "any contribution, expenditure or donation in any U.S. election." As for CAIR, it is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Internal Revenue Service regulations say that 501(c)(3) groups are "precluded from engaging in any political campaign activities." Laws aside, there is no evidence that either group has given money to Campa-Najjar. The most one could say is that a few CAIR volunteers have done so in their personal capacity. The San Diego Union-Tribune cross-referenced records of donations made to Campa-Najjar with lists of CAIR board members and found that the candidate received 18 donations from seven people totaling $17,300. Through Oct. 31, Campa-Najjar had raised $3,168,975, meaning that the donations from CAIR board members accounted for about one half of 1 percent of his donations this cycle. "None of the seven donors held paid positions with CAIR, according to public tax reports," the newspaper reported. "Donors listed their primary employers and occupations — their day jobs — to identify themselves to the campaign as required by the FEC." For instance, the Union-Tribune reached David Chami, an attorney who lives in Arizona and serves on the board of a local CAIR chapter. Chami told the newspaper "that he is not paid by CAIR and that his contribution was independent and based solely on Campa-Najjar’s position on consumer advocacy laws." He added, "My decision to help a particular candidate is based on their political positions and issues they support. It has nothing to do with religion and if it did, I’m Muslim and he is a Christian." Robert S. McCaw, the director of government affairs for CAIR, told PolitiFact, "We can confirm that CAIR or its chapters did not donate to or endorse Campa-Najjar. What staff or board members do on their own time is their own business."’ Hunter’s office did not respond to an inquiry. Our ruling Hunter said, "Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress" and "is being supported by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood." Neither group can do so under federal law, and there is no evidence that they have broken the law to donate to his campaign. Campa-Najjar has received more than a dozen personal donations from people who happen to be CAIR volunteers. We could find no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an unsubstantiated accusation that rests on fear-mongering. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-13460	"You've got a medical report on me that meets the same standard as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/14/hillary-clinton/comparing-medical-histories-clinton-trump-romney-o/	Hillary Clinton's near-collapse at a Sept. 11 memorial service and the subsequent revelation that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier has people wondering about the health of the two major presidential candidates. The Clinton campaign promised more medical data on her health, and Republican Donald Trump pledged to release details of a recent checkup. Both candidates have already released letters from their doctors saying they are healthy enough to be president. Clinton’s team argues that Trump has released less information about his health than Clinton. In an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, Clinton said her two-page 2015 letter from her physician is consistent with what presidential candidates have released in the past. "You know, you've got a medical report on me that meets the same standard as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama" when the two ran for president, Clinton said. "Donald Trump's doctor said he'd be the healthiest president in history. That's just not even serious." When Cooper asked what additional information she would be supplying, Clinton did not offer any details. "Well, we're going to be releasing more information, and I think it's fair to say, we've already met the standard of disclosure of past presidential candidates like Mitt Romney and President Obama." Actually, there is no "standard" for the type of medical information that should be released. The experts we consulted agreed. But Clinton's disclosures are on the same level as Obama and Romney in previous elections. "There is no 'standard' of medical disclosure, just whatever the voting public is comfortable with," said Jerald Podair, professor of history at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. "This means, of course, that as much secrecy as possible has been the historical norm." Thus, he said, the public didn't know about Grover Cleveland's cancer, Franklin Roosevelt's paralysis or John Kennedy's Addison’s disease. "All kept the true nature of their illnesses secret from the American public. Obviously, is is harder to do so today, but as Hillary (‘darn these allergies’) Clinton has shown, the system can still be gamed." "This is an imaginary standard set up by candidates," said Brooks Simpson, a presidential historian at Arizona State University. Interest in candidate medical records has varied over time. There was a lot of interest when John McCain ran against Obama in 2008. McCain was 71 and had a history of skin cancer. He released 1,173 pages of records going back to 2000. In contrast, medical records were not much of an issue in 2004 when George W. Bush, then 58, sought re-election against John Kerry, then 60. Both were known to be big fitness enthusiasts. Bush had received regular checkups as president but that year decided to have his physical after the election. As CNN reported at the time, "Neither President Bush nor Senator Kerry have released their full medical records, but there isn't much public pressure for either man to release more details. Americans may want a healthy commander-in-chief, but 61 percent say the president has the same rights as other citizens to keep medical records private, compared to just 38 percent in favor of releasing all information that might affect his ability to serve." It's more of an issue today, in part, because both candidates are so old. "These people are in the Ronald Reagan category," said Simpson. Trump, if elected, would be the oldest person to assume the presidency. Clinton would be the second oldest behind Reagan. "Maybe 70 is the new 60, but these people are old," Simpson said. "Neither one has really satisfied issues of disclosure in the public mind," although Clinton has been more forthcoming, he said. "Trump's efforts have been pretty feeble. But the incident on Sunday and the cough just illustrated a personal attack narrative and has given traction to an accusation that her health is less than ideal. This is a way not just to raise questions about candidate health, but about candidate transparency." When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin acknowledged that there is no real standard. He said the candidate was simply referring to the examples of Obama and Romney as a relevant point of comparison. How do their medical summaries compare? Candidate Obama Romney Clinton Trump Year 2008 2012 2015 2015 Words in doctor letter 280 535 578 174 Blood pressure 90/60 130/80 100/65 110/65 Heart rate 60 40 72 Not mentioned Triglycerides 44 179 69 Not mentioned Total cholesterol 173 169 195 Not mentioned Good cholesterol 68 Not mentioned 64 Not mentioned Bad cholesterol 96 Not mentioned 118 Not mentioned Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 0.6 Normal Not relevant .015 Allergies mentioned? No Yes Yes No Past health problems detailed? No Yes Yes Yes Family history mentioned? Yes Yes Yes No Because there is no standard, the doctors of different candidates included different levels of detail. The letters for all four candidates gave blood pressure. The letters for Obama, Romney and Clinton offered at least some blood test results, such as total cholesterol. Trump's does not. Family history, a key factor for predicting a person's lifespan or potential health problems, is missing from Trump's letter. The doctors for Clinton and Romney go into more detail about the candidate's past health problems, but that may be because they had some issues in the past. We don't know about Trump's history, but the detailed 2014 health report for Obama once he became president says he's had no significant medical problems, including no surgeries. The most detailed template was Obama’s annual presidential physical. The 2014 report contains far more information than he released when he first ran in 2008. It talks about immunizations. It lists medications (without giving doses), a fasting blood sugar level and cholesterol counts. There's also discussion of the status of his heart, lungs, eyes, head neck, bones, muscles, nerves and skin. "Probably Hillary is about right since the standard is that most politicians conceal their debilitating illnesses or fabricate (maybe exaggerate) how wonderfully healthy they are," said Bert Rockman, professor emeritus of political science at Purdue University. Because of their age, "there is bound to be something wrong with each of them despite Trump's likely-dictated note to his doctor, which meets the standard of a school boy note." "Of course, some candidates are in terrific shape — Romney and Obama, for example, and Carter," he said. "And you likely wouldn't run for president if you were seriously (physically) debilitated," putting the cases of Kennedy and Roosevelt aside. "In other words," said Rockman, "the bar is really low, and Hillary likely met it by historical standards." Our ruling Clinton said, "You've got a medical report on me that meets the same standard as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama." If Romney and Obama exemplify a standard, then the information Clinton has provided to the public is on a comparable level. But Clinton's statement implies a standard that doesn’t really exist, according to the experts. And both the quality and quantity of information on presidential candidates has varied widely. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/166c35be-09a0-4fb1-87c0-ec2491afc7ed	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-14T12:03:16	2016-09-12	['Mitt_Romney', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-01375	"2014 Federal Tax Refunds To Be Delayed Until October 2015."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/16/chain-email/viral-claim-says-irs-will-be-delaying-tax-refunds-/	Readers recently forwarded us a claim they had begun seeing in their inbox -- and which their friends were believing. It was a link to a story headlined, "2014 Federal Tax Refunds To Be Delayed Until October 2015." This would be a pretty big deal if true. Is it? The short answer is: No. It turns out that the article was published in September 2014 on a website called the National Report. Here’s a portion of the article: "Normally when you file your taxes, whatever money is owed back to you is quickly repaid. The process of getting your money back has been made even quicker in recent years through the use of E-file and direct deposit of federal tax rebates. But starting in 2015, federal tax refunds for the 2014 fiscal year are going to take longer for Americans to receive. A lot longer. "The deadline to have your federal taxes filed will remain April 15th, but under new directives issued to the IRS, no refunds are to be issued before October 15th, 2015. This means that early filers who normally receive their refunds around the beginning of February will have to wait an additional 7 months longer than normal to get the money owed to them. "White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended the upcoming changes to IRS tax refund policy. 'It’s a minor cost saving measure initiated by the administration with bipartisan support,' said Earnest. 'The recommendation to initiate this new refund structure came out of the Committee On Ways And Means, under the leadership of Republican Congressman David Camp. Absolutely zero dollars are going to be kept that is owed to hardworking Americans. All you are seeing here is a policy change streamlining the way in which the IRS structures tax refund repayments. Americans who find this objectionable can always opt to bring their tax withholding more in line with the actual taxes they will owe in the future.' " The article went on to quote two Republican senators critical of the move -- Rand Paul of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona. A lot of people appeared to believe it. The article was shared 647,000 times on Facebook since it was published. Forbes tax columnist Kelly Phillips Erb was among those who noted its wide reach. There is one problem with the claim: It comes from a fake-news site. The last time we checked a bogus claim from National Report, the site had a disclaimer that said "the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report." This disclaimer has since been removed by the site. Another, clearer disclaimer -- also removed -- has been archived by urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com. The disclaimer said, "National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental." We reached out several times to the IRS to see if we could get an official disclaimer from the agency, but we never heard back. Our Ruling A chain email has been circulating with a link to an article headlined, "2014 Federal Tax Refunds To Be Delayed Until October 2015." However, the article comes from the National Report, a satire website. It is not accurate and was never intended to be. We rate the claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-00579	"Our reserves are now in much better shape than they were just a few years ago."	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/09/lee-may/claim-about-dekalb-finances-hits-mark/	When the Great Recession battered property values, counties across metro Atlanta responded to plunging revenues by raising tax rates. Cobb raised rates 16 percent, DeKalb by 26 percent and Gwinnett by 21 percent in recent years. DeKalb County also dipped into its reserves to balance its budget and paid another price: it ended fiscal year 2011 without a cent in that rainy day fund. So it made news when interim DeKalb CEO Lee May announced last week that property values had rebounded enough that, the county’s reserve funds, taken together, now cover one month’s operating expense, as recommended by the state as well as county policy. "Our reserves are now in much better shape than they were just a few years ago," May said. PolitiFact Georgia was intrigued. Did DeKalb’s fund balance – the budget jargon for the reserves – really swell from nothing to a projected $57.5 million in four years? The history Such a financial turnaround would be a much needed boost to the county, where suspended CEO Burrell Ellis is about to be retried on charges he extorting campaign cash from companies that do work for the county. In the two years since the initial indictment, a county commissioner has begun serving a 14-month sentence for defrauding taxpayers of more than $100,000, a former member of the county’s Zoning Board of Appeals pleaded guilty in February to taking a bribe for his vote and the former county school superintendent pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction in a racketeering case. In the midst of that, the county also has struggled financially. The net value of all taxable property in DeKalb County tumbled from $24 billion in 2010 to $21 billion in 2011, according to the county’s consolidation sheets. When the county revealed it had spent all of its rainy day fund to make ends meet in 2011, national bond rating agencies took note. The agencies downgraded DeKalb’s credit score, meaning taxpayers paid higher interest rates on borrowing for major projects. As recently as November 2013, Fitch Ratings said it still had concerns about the depleted reserves even as the county slowly tried to rebuild them. County audits show the slow growth, including adjustments made in 2014 when the county switched its reserve accounting from cash on hand to modified accrual, so that all bills were paid with funds from the year they were charged: Year End Reserves Goal Percentage 2010 -$4.5 million $45 million -.10% 2011 $30 million $44 milion 68% 2012 $41.5 million $45 million 92% 2013 $42 million $45 million 93% 2014 $49 million $48 million 102% 2015 $57.5 million $48 million 120% Source: County audits, 2015 midyear budget recommendations A main challenge was that property values stayed low. Last year that net taxable value – called the digest – remained effectively the same as 2011, at $20.2 billion, according to data from the county property appraiser. The change for 2015: The total gross value is projected to be $24.7 billion by year’s end, with a net value of $22 billion. That increase is projected to bring in another $36 million in revenue this year. May’s midyear budget adjustment calls for the county to spend $12.7 million of that money on items such as body cameras for police officers. But May wants the rest, nearly $23 million, to be put into reserves. "We had dipped into our reserves to make ends meet, which cost us our credit rating. We have spent every year since trying to restore that," said county spokesman Burke Brennan. "It’s our greatest single allocation from the increase from the economic recovery, but we will accomplish our goal." There are two caveats to that claim. One is detailed. May’s proposed budget adjustment shows that two of the five active tax funds – the fund set aside for fire service and unincorporated reserve that takes money from Recorders Court and business licenses – will fall below that one month goal. Only when the police reserve, designated reserve for roads and parks and the general fund reserve are added in does the overall reserve reach the 1.2 month of expenditures. Rating agencies will look at the both the individual funds and the combined total reserve in their reviews. Michael Rinaldi, a senior director for Fitch who is the primary analyst for DeKalb, said that agency would consider police and fire reserves to be for essential services but would also look holistically. "They have been moving in the right direction," Rinaldi said. "We certainly look at the trend, and if there would be a strain for the general fund to cover any deficits. In this case, that is generally not an issue." The second asterisk relates to the process itself. May’s claim is based on his proposed budget adjustments. But the Board of County Commissioners has final say on those adjustments and may make changes before a vote in July. Our ruling May claimed that his mid-year budget would leave the county’s reserve funds in better shape than they have been in years. Considering in 2011, there was no money in that rainy day fund, improvement wouldn’t be difficult.

pomt-03450	"Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/20/joe-biden/biden-newtown-more-american-gun-deaths-soldiers-lo/	In the six months since a gunman killed his mother, six educators and 20 children in Newtown, Conn., gun control legislation has ground to a halt in Congress. In the face of political opposition, mainly from Republicans but also from some Democrats, the White House has readied a more limited approach in a package of executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence. Vice President Joe Biden outlined those measures in a press conference Tuesday, emphasizing that President Barack Obama will still press for a new law. In making the case, Biden said, "Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. Pretty astounding. And Iraq, as a matter of fact. Over 5,000. That's no way to run a country." Obama repeated Biden’s stat in a tweet. Readers asked us if the number was right, so we decided to take a look at his numbers. The White House press office told us that Biden was speaking about American casualties since the start of the war in Afghanistan. That number is 2,106, according a fact sheet updated daily by the U.S. Defense Department. Another tally, maintained by the Associated Press, shows nearly the same figure. Firearm deaths are more difficult to count. Biden relied on a database assembled by Slate, an online magazine. The numbers there come from average people who send links of newspaper stories about gun deaths in their communities; we found no duplicate entries. This approach is likely to undercount deaths, and it still shows some 5,176 fatalities in the six months since Newtown. The numbers back up Biden’s claim. In a span of half a year, there were more than 5,000 gun fatalities in the United States. In a dozen years, fewer than half that number of Americans died in the war in Afghanistan. Biden also referred to Iraq. Deaths there reached 4,422, according to the Pentagon. That’s higher, but still less than fatalities due to firearms in America since mid December, 2012. We should note that Slate’s statistics don’t distinguish among suicides, homicides, accidents and law enforcement actions. Also, Biden's comparison doesn't take into account that the deaths occurred in populations of very different size. When Biden said "that’s no way to run a country", that would take in the entire U.S. population. We calculated the death rates implicit in his claim. When you do the math for the 5,176 gun deaths and the population base is over 316 million, the rate turns out to be .016 per 1,000. To make the same calculation for American service fatalities in Afghanistan, we contacted the Defense Department to determine the number of people at risk. The total number of soldiers deployed in that country for Operation Enduring Freedom is a bit over 823,000. The death rate comes out to 2.56 per 1,000. That’s nearly 150 times bigger than the death rate by guns in the United States since Newtown. A similar calculation for Operation Iraqi Freedom yielded a rate of 3.97 deaths per 1,000. To get a longer term view of firearm fatalities in America, we went to a database run by the Centers for Disease Control. There we learned that between 2001 and 2010, the rate was .103 per 1,000. That’s higher than the rate since Newtown but still 25 times smaller than for the Afghanistan war. Lastly, it’s important to note that one expects deaths in a war zone. The gun deaths in the United States represent deaths during peacetime. Biden said America has lost more people to guns since Newtown than it has in the war in Afghanistan. He is correct that more than twice as many people died in the past six months as did in 12 years of fighting. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12329	"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose government has important business and policy before the president of the United States, has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/19/karl-racine/did-saudis-spend-money-trump-hotels-yes/	Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said foreign governments are trying to curry favor with the president of the United States, and they’re using Trump International Hotel to do it. "Just one example: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose government has important business and policy before the president of the United States, has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel," Racine said. Racine and Attorney General Brian Frosh of Maryland on June 12 announced that they had filed a lawsuit in federal court against Donald Trump for violating the Constitution’s anti-corruption provisions known as the emoluments clause. The emoluments clause bars the president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign government without the permission of Congress. It’s a question for the courts whether the Saudi government using a Trump hotel violates that rule. We wanted to dig into the details of how the lawsuit determined that the Saudi government had indeed spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel. Racine’s office directed us to disclosures made by an agent representing the embassy of Saudi Arabia in the Foreign Agent Registration Act report filed with the U.S. Justice Department. The act requires that people acting as agents of foreign countries disclose their relationship, as well as their activities and spending. They also directed us to the lawsuit, which mentions various other instances of foreign government officials either shifting pre-planned events to Trump International Hotel or making use of its services. The Foreign Agent Registration Act report filed by MSL Group Americas, Inc, a global public relations firm is for the period from October 2016 to March 2017. It lists Saudi Arabia, China, and Equatorial Guinea as its clients, and Bahrain as former clients. The filings say that Qorvis MSL Group, a lobbying firm, paid approximately $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel. Of this, $190,272.87 was for lodging, $78,204.02 for catering and $1,568 for parking on behalf of the Saudi government. The group was hired by the Saudi government to lobby against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) and managing a grassroots campaign against it, including coordinating visits by veterans to Capitol Hill to oppose the bill. There are several media reports about the Saudis spending $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel with one mentioning how veterans were offered free stays at the hotel, where a standard room costs $500. The trip for veterans to Washington was part of a plan funded by the Saudi government to recruit veterans to oppose the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) and speak with lawmakers. Under JASTA, Americans can sue foreign governments for acts of terrorism on American soil. Congress overrode a veto from then-President Barack Obama to enact the law in September 2016. Later that year, Republican lawmakers John McCain and Lindsey Graham introduced an amendment to the act so that foreign governments would face lawsuits only if they knowingly supported terrorism, but the amendment was unsuccessful. Although it is difficult to determine from the filings the exact dates the payments were made to the Trump hotel, a Wall Street Journal story quoted a MSL group executive as saying that most were made before Trump became president while some were made after he was elected. Our ruling Racine said the Saudi government has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel. The Foreign Agent Registration Act report mentions at least one filing which clearly shows that the Saudi government spent $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel for lodging and boarding expenses between October 2016 and March 2017. It’s not clear whether the entire expenses were paid before or after Trump became president. Our research showed it was some of both. The statement is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-14965	Says Bernie Sanders is going to "tax you people at 90 percent."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-bernie-sanders-wants-tax-everyone-90-percent/	At a recent rally in Richmond, Va., Donald Trump called Bernie Sanders the c-word — "communist" — and suggested that Sanders’ plans for wealth redistribution extends beyond targeting Trump and other billionaires. Under Sanders, Trump said, tax hikes would come for everyone. "This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton’s) right is giving everything away, so she’s following," Trump said on Oct. 14, referring to the Democratic debate the night before. "He’s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He’s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I’d call him a socialist/communist, okay? ‘Cause that's what he is." A few days later, Sanders dismissed Trump’s comments in an interview on ABC’s This Week. "Well, if I had to respond to every absurd thing that Donald Trump said, I would spend my whole life doing it," Sanders said in the Oct. 18 interview. He added, "Yes, we are going to ask Trump and his billionaire friends to pay more in taxes. ...We'll come up with that rate. But it will be a damned lot higher than it is right now." It’s clear that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the "1 percent." But does he want to tax the average Americans standing before Trump at the Richmond rally at 90 percent as well? Sanders hasn’t released a tax plan yet, and we searched Lexis Nexis and CQ and found that Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 percent tax rate for billionaires, let alone applying that rate across the board. We asked the Trump campaign how the GOP frontrunner knew what Sanders is proposing, but we didn’t hear back. However, he may be distorting comments Sanders made in May 2015 about the marginal tax rate for the very wealthy. Just like Ike Early in his campaign, Sanders drew alarm when he said in an interview with CNBC that he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent is too high. Briefly, the marginal tax rate is applied to the last dollar you earn. The U.S. tax system is based on tax brackets. Let’s say you were a single filer who earned $410,000 in adjusted gross income last year. The first $9,075 you earned was taxed at 10 percent, the amount from $9,076 to $36,900 was taxed at 15 percent, the amount from $36,901 to $89,350 was taxed at 25 percent, the amount from $89,351 to $186,350 was taxed at 28 percent, the amount from $186,351 to $405,100 was taxed at 33 percent, the amount from $405,101 to $406,750 was taxed at 35 percent, and the amount above $406,751 was taxed at 39.6 percent. In other words, the current top marginal tax rate is 39.6 percent, affecting individuals who make more than $400,000 a year. That’s roughly the threshold to make it into the top 1 percent of incomes if you’re filing as an individual. And even for this sample filer making $410,000, that 39.6 percent tax rate hits only a relatively small amount of their income. The average American never sees marginal federal income tax rates that high. "If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent," Sanders said on May 26 (his memory is correct). "That's not 90 percent of your income, you know? That's the marginal." Many on the right and left interpreted Sander’ comments as advocating for increasing the top rate to 90 percent. The Sanders camp, however, told us the Vermont senator has made it very clear that that’s not what he was saying. Looking at his past comments — one from 2008, four from this year — Sanders doesn’t seem like he’s committed to any figure: • Nov. 5, 2008 on Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto: Sanders said of the top tax rate, "No, of course, it is not going to be 90 percent." Pressed by Cavuto for a figure, Sanders said, "Neil, I’m not going to develop tax policy in a three-minute segment on your show." • June 2, 2015 on Yahoo! News: In response to host Katie Couric’s suggestion that he proposed taxing the wealthiest Americans at 90 percent, Sanders interjected, "No, I didn’t. It’s not true. That’s one of these things that seems to be circulating. We haven’t come up with a formal tax proposal. ...Will we raise the individual tax rate for the wealthy? Absolutely, but we haven’t come up with a number yet." • June 11, 2015 on Charlie Rose: "We are working right now on a comprehensive tax package which I suspect will for the top marginal rates go over 50 percent." • Sept. 18, 2015 on CBS This Morning: "No, I don’t think you have to go up to 90 percent. …I don’t know if you have to go there but we will come up with some very specific ideas." • Sept. 23, 2015 on CNN New Day: "If you are extremely wealthy, yes, you are going to pay more in taxes. If you are a large corporation today, by the way, that's stashing your money in the Cayman Islands and not paying a nickel in federal taxes, yes, you are going to be paying taxes." In short, the most specific figure we found from Sanders on the top marginal tax rate is not terribly specific — "over 50 percent" — and it would not affect all but a tiny fraction of Americans. Nothing is certain but taxing corporations And that’s the point that’s even more problematic with Trump’s claim -- who Sanders’ supposed 90 percent tax would affect. Most of the taxes that Sanders has actually proposed in writing would not apply to "you people." The one exception would raise the rate to far below 90 percent. His call for paid family and medical leave, based on legislation introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., would require "just a small increase in the payroll tax" that would hit everyone, Sanders said on This Week. How small? Employers and employees would chip in an additional 0.2 percent each, bringing the federal payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. According to a report by Gillibrand’s office, that’s the equivalent of $72.04 per year for the average worker, and $227.40 for the highest wage earners. For corporations and the very wealthy, Sanders’ proposed tax increases and new taxes may hurt more. Here’s a rundown: • Increase the top estate tax rate from 40 percent to 45 percent for estates valued at $3.5 million to $10 million; 50 percent for $10 million to $50 million; 55 percent for $50 million to $1 billion; and 65 percent for estates over $1 billion (estates under $3.5 million will be exempt) • Create a tax on trading transactions that would impose a 0.5 percent rate for stock trades, 0.1 percent for bonds and 0.005 percent for derivatives to pay for free tuition at all public colleges • Eliminate the cap on payroll taxes for incomes over $118,500 and tax all income above $250,000 to expand Social Security • Eliminate tax deferrals for U.S. corporations located abroad and tax breaks for oil, gas and coal companies Beyond this, there’s some doubt that Sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases. Indeed, one tax expert cautioned against speculating because Sanders has been so vague about his proposals. "There is not enough substance to (Sanders’) proposals for anyone to have analyzed them," said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "Organizations typically wait until there is a fully formulated plan before they try to model them. Sanders is not anywhere near that point yet." Sanders’ director of policy, Warren Gunnels, told us, "Once he introduces his individual tax reform plan, we'll let you know." And in turn, we will let you know. Our ruling Trump said Bernie Sanders is going to "tax you people at 90 percent." Sanders hasn’t released an official tax plan, either for billionaires or for anyone else. But based on his previous comments and proposals, the tax policies Sanders is advocating are targeted at corporations and affluent Americans. Sanders has dismissed the notion that he wants to set marginal tax rates for billionaires at 90 percent. But even if he did end up doing that, that rate wouldn’t affect "you people" — that is, the rank and file Americans who attended Trump’s rally. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08889	"Jeff Greene can buy anything" ... he owns two mansions.	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/30/kendrick-meek/what-you-see-what-you-get-meek-has-photos-jeff-gre/	It's the subtle visuals in TV ads that sometimes stick with viewers. Take U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek's second ad in his Democratic U.S. Senate primary against rival Jeff Greene. The 30-second ad is called, "Can Buy Anything," and focuses on how Greene made money using a complicated financial instrument called credit default swaps. We've written a lot about credit default swaps -- an investment that paid Greene hundreds of millions of dollars when other people's mortgages went bust, or their properties fell into foreclosure -- read here, here and here for a primer. But that's not what we noticed. What caught our eye were the images that filled the screen when a narrator uttered this line, "Jeff Greene can buy anything, except the truth." The images included a picture of Greene from one of his ads, a picture of him on a yacht and a picture of two houses. One is labeled "Mansion." The other is "Mansion 2." Greene is worth a small fortune -- a required federal disclosure lists his assets as ranging in value between $827 million and $2.8 billion. So we're not surprised the man would own two large homes. But we wanted to see if the Meek campaign had done its homework and produced real pictures of the homes. Or if the pictures were generic images of palacial digs. A bit of Internet searching reveals the answer. We first checked the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser to see about property Greene owns in his hometown. According to records, Greene dropped $24 million on a waterfront home in December 2009. We're not going to list the address here, but using the address, we were able to find the original for-sale listing. The nine bedroom, nine bathroom home was listed through The Corcoran Group. From the listing: Mizner's Coconut Hill - 234' Direct Oceanfront - Beautifully sited on 3.8 +/- acres, this unique compound boasts a long winding entry and limitless ocean vistas. Offering total privacy and approximately 12,000 square feet of well scaled living spaces, its original finishes remain: limestone, pecky cypress, stone/hardwood floors, french Palladian doors and more. Gracious outdoor terraces & an elegant oversized swimming pool complete this spectacular property that awaits a restoration and potential expansion. The listing included this photo gallery. Sure enough, the home is indeed what's called "Mansion" in Meek's campaign ad. As for "Mansion 2," the property isn't in Florida at all, but rather California. It's a 25-acre estate in Beverly Hills he calls Palazzo di Amore. And it's Greene's. He used to live there but now is renting out the 43,000-square-foot home for $25,000 a month. (The home is still on the market, according to a Realtor's website, if you're interested). The Wall Street Journal profiled the property last October. Mr. Greene ... bought the unfinished property out of receivership for $35 million in 2006 and has spent nearly three years and $15 million finishing it. The 43,000 square foot main house has 11 bedrooms, 14 baths and a 6,000 square foot ballroom. Six acres of vineyards produce 400 cases of wine annually. The Journal article includes what appears to be the same image that is in Meek's ad. For the record, Realtors define a mansion as a home bigger than 8,000 square feet -- meaning both Greene properties qualify. And if you were wondering, the picture of Greene on the yacht is legit, too. It's ripped from a Forbes profile. The Forbes caption reads, "Los Angeles real estate mogul Jeff Greene aboard his 145-foot yacht, Summerwind, docket at the Sag Harbor wharf of New York's tony Hamptons." That's the same yacht that tore up a coral reef in Belize, by the way. In Kendrick Meek's second TV ad, he uses pictures of two homes and labels them "Mansion" and "Mansion 2" to help illustrate rival Jeff Greene's personal fortune. We wanted to know if those images were real or simply placeholders. Turns out, what you see is what you get. We rate Meek's claim True.

pomt-11775	Wisconsin has "the fastest-shrinking middle class in the country."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/29/mahlon-mitchell/its-close-wisconsin-doesnt-have-fastest-shrinking-/	Mahlon Mitchell, the latest in an historic number of Democrats who are running for governor of Wisconsin in 2018, entered the race ready with criticism of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Mitchell, president of the Professional Firefighters of Wisconsin union, was asked what changes he would make from the policies of Walker, who is seeking a third term. On the Nov. 19, 2017 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a Milwaukee-based TV talk show, Mitchell replied by saying: Well, there’s a lot of them. I think we actually have to make sure the people of Wisconsin are first. We need to make sure that we raise wages. We haven’t done that. We have the highest -- and the fastest-shrinking middle class in the country. Let’s see if Mitchell’s statement about the fastest-shrinking middle class -- while criticizing Walker, but not directly blaming him -- fares better than two similar statements that both failed on the Truth-O-Meter. Two past fact checks Both of the previous claims were about the rate of decline of the size of the middle class. 1. In 2015, liberal MSNBC talk-show host Rachel Maddow said that under Walker, "the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country." Our rating was False. Maddow cited a March 2015 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a widely respected nonpartisan research organization. Between 2000 and 2013, the size of Wisconsin’s middle class shrank by 5.7 percentage points -- the largest among the 50 states. But Walker didn’t become governor until January 2011. We ran updated University of Minnesota data, the same used by Pew, to compare 2010, the year before Walker took office, to 2013, the latest year then available. Wisconsin’s middle class had dropped by 0.5 percentage points, 24th among the 50 states. 2. In January 2017, state Rep. Peter Barca, a Kenosha Democrat who was then the Assembly’s minority leader, said Wisconsin’s middle class is the "most diminished" in the United States. Our rating was False. Barca also relied on the 2015 Pew report. We ran updated University of Minnesota data and found that in 2015, the size of Wisconsin’s middle class was down 4.5 percentage points from 2000 -- the 10th-largest decline of any state, not the largest. To back Mitchell’s statement, his campaign also cited the 2015 Pew report. But, as we noted, more recent data is available, so we again ran the University of Minnesota numbers. Latest numbers Using Pew’s formula, a Wisconsin household was in the middle class in 2016 if its income was between $38,063 and $113,622. For that year, 48.5 percent of Wisconsin households were in the middle class. Here’s how Wisconsin ranked comparing 2000 -- the year the Pew report, which was cited by Mitchell, used as a starting point -- to 2016, the latest year available; and comparing 2010 to 2016, for Walker’s tenure: Period Percentage points shrinkage in size of middle class Rank among the states 2000 to 2016 6.1 1st 2010 to 2016 0.9 14th So, Mitchell’s statement is accurate in the first instance. But his statement was made in the context of criticizing Walker, and during Walker’s tenure Wisconsin ranked 14th, not first. Two notes before we close: During both periods, most Wisconsin households that left the middle class went to the higher income bracket, rather than dropping down out of the middle class. But when adjusting for inflation, the median household income in Wisconsin -- where half of households earn more and half earn less -- was lower in 2016 than it was in 2000. Our rating Mitchell said Wisconsin has "the fastest-shrinking middle class in the country." Mitchell pointed to a report by Pew Charitable Trusts, which compared the states going back to 2000. Using Pew’s formula and running the latest-available data, we found Wisconsin ranked first in the shrinkage of the size of its middle class when comparing 2000 to 2016. But Mitchell made his statement while criticizing Walker, and during Walker’s tenure, Wisconsin’s shrinkage ranked 14th when comparing 2010 to 2016. For a statement that contains an element of truth but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-14731	The United States spends "almost three times per capita what they spend in the U.K." on health care and "50 percent more than they pay in France."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/20/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-us-spends-three/	Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says the best solution to address problems in the United States’ health care system is to guarantee every American access to health care as a right. Speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate, Sanders continued to express support for a single-payer health care system that is popular throughout much of the rest of the world. To make his point, Sanders compared health care costs between the United States and two other Western nations -- the United Kingdom and France. "Why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K. -- 50 percent more than what they pay in France?" Sanders asked. "The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress. We need to pass a Medicare-for-all single-payer system." Sanders’ numbers are arresting and largely correct. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has the data for all three nations. The following table has breakdown. United States United Kingdom France Total (per capita) $8,713 $3,234 $4,123 Public health care (per capita) $4,197 $2802 $3,247 Private health care (per capita) $4,515 $561 $876 Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Do the math, and total U.S. spending is about 2.7 times what they spend in the United Kingdom per person, and a bit over twice what they spend per person in France. Everything is measured in dollars, and the data are from 2013. It’s interesting to note the role that public spending makes in each country. In the United States, public and private spending are nearly the same. In the United Kingdom and France, private spending is a much smaller slice of the total. Sanders’ claim in this case is more accurate than more sweeping versions he has made in the past. In 2009 and again in 2015, he claimed that the United States spends twice as much per capita on health care as any other country. Those claims are overly broad. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States spends almost three times on health care per capita what is spent in the United Kingdom and about double what they spend in France. The numbers from an independent, reliable source back that up.

pomt-04772	"We've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/27/joseph-kyrillos/us-senate-hopeful-joe-kyrillos-claims-united-state/	When it comes to taxing businesses, the United States is leading the world, according to Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos. As he looks to unseat Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez this November, Kyrillos has refused to sign an anti-tax pledge, but maintained in an Aug. 20 interview on WOR-AM that he’s looking to lower tax rates. "We've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world, in the world," said Kyrillos, a state senator representing Monmouth County. "So, I’m about reducing tax rates." As far as the corporate tax rates on the books, Kyrillos’ claim is on the money. However, when you factor in various tax breaks, the rate actually paid by U.S. businesses has been among the highest in the world, but not in first place, studies show. For this fact-check, we’re focusing on two different types of corporate tax rates: statutory and effective rates. To back up Kyrillos’ claim, a spokeswoman pointed to the top statutory corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent in the United States. That figure represents a combination of federal, state and local tax rates imposed by law before any tax breaks. Once Japan reduced its combined corporate tax rate in April, the U.S. rate became the highest among industrialized nations, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group. So, Kyrillos’ claim about a first-place finish is on target in terms of statutory rates. But the United States does not necessarily lead the world when you consider the effective tax rates paid by U.S. businesses. Due to various tax breaks, those rates are typically lower than the top statutory rate. In a September 2011 report, the Tax Foundation summarized the findings of the latest 13 studies of effective corporate tax rates across the world. Due to different methodologies, those studies determined U.S. effective tax rates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, according to the report. The United States did not rank first in any of those studies, but in 10 of them, U.S. effective rates ranked among the top five highest for the countries analyzed, the report states. However, the effective rate in Japan will likely drop, possibly moving the United States to the top spot in future studies. Apart from that Tax Foundation report, it’s worth noting that a separate analysis found thirty Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn’t pay any federal corporate income taxes over the 2008-2010 period. That study was done by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. So, what’s the better measure -- statutory or effective rates? According to Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge, statutory rates make for better comparisons. Effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries, but the statutory rates are fixed, Hodge told us. "(The effective tax rate) will differ from industry to industry and business to business, whereas the list price is what it is and everyone starts at that point," Hodge said. But Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, argued that "effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens." Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, added in an e-mail that "both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax." Our ruling In a radio interview, Kyrillos claimed, "We've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world." It’s accurate that, at 39.2 percent, the United States has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. But with various tax breaks, U.S. effective corporate tax rates range anywhere from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, studies show. Those effective tax rates may not land in first place, but they’re still among the highest in the world. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13567	Says a CNN anchor said that Hillary Clinton has gotten "a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-fundraising-email-takes-cnn-anchors-c/	The media has been one of Donald Trump’s most consistent targets during his 2016 presidential campaign. In a recent fundraising email, his campaign called out CNN. "Friend, a CNN anchor acknowledged that the media has given Hillary Clinton a ‘free ride,’ " the email said. It then quoted a comment attributed to CNN morning anchor Chris Cuomo: "We couldn't help her any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign." The email, signed by Brad Parscale of "Team TRUMP," provides links to donate money and includes the following GIF of CNN’s Cuomo. We decided to see whether Cuomo did in fact say, "We couldn't help her (Hillary Clinton) any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign." We found that Cuomo did say those words -- but that their meaning is not as clear-cut as the Trump campaign indicates. (CNN declined an opportunity to comment. Trump’s campaign did not respond to inquiries.) Cuomo’s comment came on the show he co-anchors, New Day — but a crucial fact not mentioned by the Trump campaign email is that the comments came more than two years ago, on June 9, 2014. That timing makes a significant difference for the meaning of Cuomo’s words. In mid 2014, Clinton was widely believed to be a presidential candidate in waiting, but she had not officially announced that she was running for the White House. She did not officially announce her candidacy until April 12, 2015, more than 10 months after the CNN exchange aired. The news peg for the CNN discussion was the media promotion that Clinton was doing in advance of the June 10, 2014, publication of her book, Hard Choices: A Memoir. For someone who was officially a non-candidate for president, Clinton’s book-promotion efforts enabled her to get some "earned" media, meaning news coverage without having to pay for ads. That’s the backdrop for the CNN discussion, as this excerpt shows: Brianna Keilar, CNN correspondent: "So, trying to downplay the issue there, but this book is part of the big book rollout. There will be other interviews. There will be a lot of speeches. There will be book signings. And all of it, Brooke and Chris, is designed to sell books and keep her well positioned for a 2016 run." Brooke Baldwin, CNN co-anchor: "We talked about this before, nothing is on accident, this is all perfectly choreographed to read through the tea leaves of whatever it is she says this week. But, you know, Diane Sawyer (of ABC) said to her, you know, listen, it sort of seems the party is frozen right now. So, let me ask you about that about the people who may possibly run against her at least on the left side of the aisle. She said that they can do whatever they choose to do in whatever timetable they decide. But that's not entirely true." Keilar: "No, it's not really true. I mean, there's not a whole lot maybe she can do about it right now, because I think pretty much, everyone agrees, the sooner she gets into this race, the trickier it is for her. But largely right now when you're looking at staff picks and fundraising, those folks are kind of holding their fire. So, I think she has, if she decides she is probably going to run, she's got a little more time. If she's thinking she may not run, then she kind of needs to get out of the way and let some of these Democrats, you know, make headway when it comes to fundraising and stuff." Cuomo: "What your guys’ take on this? I was actually happy that Diane pressed her the way she did. You know, it's a dicey move because when Hillary becomes candidate and becomes the presumptive candidate, that can come back and hurt you. But Diane pressed her anyway and got her to say, yes, by the end of the year. That's early, by the way, right, Brianna? I mean, you know, if she says end of the year, I'm in, she's early." ... Baldwin: "Okay, Brianna, thank you very much. We'll be talking about this later on in the morning. But just quickly, to your point, I mean, if it does take quite a while longer, what happens to the other folks who want to attempt to run against her?" Cuomo: "Because she's doing what they call in politics, freezing pockets, because the donors are giving her money thinking she's going to run. That means they're not going to have available money for other candidates --" Baldwin: "Exactly." Cuomo: "-- if she doesn't and I don't think she's going to give it to them." Baldwin: "She's on her way." Cuomo: "We'll see. We couldn't help her any more than we have. She's got just a free ride, so far, from the media. We're the biggest ones promoting her campaign. So, it better happen." So those were Cuomo’s words. But there is a strong argument for an alternative, and far less controversial, interpretation than the one the Trump campaign offered. The first thing to note is that the "help" Cuomo is referring to is the advance coverage of Clinton’s book release. This is the same type of "earned media" that Trump has built his campaign on. For both candidates, political celebrity plus newsworthy comments equals media coverage. And by "free ride," Cuomo isn’t saying that the media has been unquestioning toward Clinton. Quite the opposite — Cuomo applauded what he saw as Sawyer’s tough questioning of Clinton. Moments before the quote highlighted by the Trump campaign, Cuomo specifically said, "I was actually happy that Diane pressed her the way she did. You know, it's a dicey move because when Hillary becomes candidate and becomes the presumptive candidate, that can come back and hurt you." The "free ride" for Clinton seems to refer to the earned — literally, "free" — media coverage that Clinton was enjoying at the time, much as Trump eventually would. It was "free" in the sense that Clinton didn’t have to pay a dime for the coverage of her book release. The same logic can be used to support Cuomo’s comment that "we’re the biggest ones promoting her campaign." He doesn’t mean "promote" in the sense of "support the election of," but rather "give a media platform to," at a time when she would not be able to run paid presidential campaign ads. It’s also worth noting that, if you watch the original video, Cuomo is smiling as he banters with Baldwin. When Cuomo says, "So it better happen," which is a portion of the quote that doesn’t appear in the Trump email, he appears to be joking that it would all be a big waste of journalists’ time if Clinton didn’t end up running for president. Our ruling The Trump campaign email says that Cuomo said, "We couldn't help (Hillary Clinton) any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign." Cuomo did literally say those words, but the Trump campaign has taken them significantly out of context. Cuomo said these words more than two years ago, before Clinton declared herself a presidential candidate. Given this backdrop, the most plausible interpretation is that Cuomo was noting Clinton’s reliance on "free" media from outlets like CNN at a time when she would not have been able to run campaign ads or other electoral-advocacy efforts. And Cuomo’s smile — along with his comment that the campaign "better happen" after all the time they spent covering Clinton’s book — suggests that he’s being a bit smart-alecky rather than fully serious.

pomt-12895	"In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/23/donald-trump/white-house-website-says-dc-homicides-climbed-50-p/	When Donald Trump was inaugurated as the nation’s 45th president, the incoming administration quickly put its mark on the White House website. In the section titled, "Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community," it says in part, "The Trump Administration is committed to reducing violent crime. In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. There were thousands of shootings in Chicago last year alone." In this article, we’ll fact-check this portion of that statement: "In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent." The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. We turned to data from the Metropolitan Police Department, the Washington, D.C., police force. In 2014, there were 105 homicides in D.C. The following year -- 2015 -- there were 162. That’s an increase of 54 percent -- and that’s in line with what the White House website said. But the story doesn’t end there. There is already city-level data for homicides in 2016, and the release of that data painted a different picture. The figure for 2016 was 135 homicides. That’s down 17 percent from the previous year -- not up roughly 50 percent. "In 2015, Washington, D.C., as well as many other large cities, saw a significant increase in homicides," said Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Margarita A. Mikhaylova. But Washington, D.C., "has been able to notably reduce the homicide rate in 2016." She cited "a concerted focus on removing illegal firearms from the streets, preventing robberies, and especially, continuing to build trust with the communities we serve." Mikhaylova added that violent crime overall -- which includes homicides, sex crimes, assaults with a dangerous weapon, and robbery -- fell by 10 percent in Washington, D.C., between 2015 and 2016. Let’s look at the trend a little further back. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So, over the previous two decades, the number of homicides in Washington, D.C., has tumbled -- it’s 55 percent lower than 20 years earlier. That said, the number of homicides has risen by 53 percent since it hit its lowest level in 2012. In theory, that statistic can be used to bolster Trump’s claim. However, using the low year of 2012 as the baseline amounts to cherry picking. Both the longer-term trend (20 years) and the most recent year-over-year figure are down, rather than up. Our ruling The Trump White House website said, "In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent." That statistic would have been correct prior to the release of the most recent annual statistics by the Metropolitan Police Department. However, the most recent figures, from 2016, show a 17 percent decline in homicides from 2015. In addition, the long-term trend shows significantly lower numbers for homicides in Washington, D.C., than was the rule for the 1990s -- even if you compare the spike of 2015.

pomt-03023	Democrats already agreed to "a deal that Republicans wanted, that Eric Cantor said would be a win."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/11/bill-burton/burton-says-rep-eric-cantor-called-deal-democrats-/	Whatever damage Democrats might incur through the government shutdown, they have found some satisfaction in trying to highlight the gap between House Republican leaders and their more tea party-oriented members. Former White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton worked that theme in an appearance on CNN’s Crossfire. In response to the charge that President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats are unwilling to negotiate, Burton shot back, "We have negotiated a deal that Republicans wanted, that Eric Cantor said would be a win." We wanted to verify the claim that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., had signed off on a deal. But before we do that, it’s helpful to put Burton’s comment into the context of the rapid fire exchange on Crossfire. In that conversation, the issues of re-opening the government and avoiding a default on the national debt became intertwined. At one point, Burton said "If there is a bipartisan majority that will pass this that we can use to avert this shutdown, why the theatrics? Why flirt with disaster?" A few moments later, co-host S.E. Cupp pressed Burton on the debt ceiling. Cupp: "I'm saying, attach the debt ceiling to spending cuts, deficit reduction ...And you haven't answered yet why the president won't negotiate if he thinks defaulting is so catastrophic." Burton: "Well, two things, ... No. 1, he has negotiated. We have negotiated a deal that Republicans wanted, that Eric Cantor said would be a win." Burton used the deal on a stop-gap spending bill to counter the claim that Obama is unwilling to negotiate. But the question was aimed at negotiations on the debt ceiling. The temporary spending deal Burton had in mind broke down when House Republican leaders failed to bring their fellow Republicans along. However, keeping the government open technically is a separate issue from raising the debt limit. Cantor and the budget deal We contacted Burton’s office for details on Cantor’s role leading up to the shutdown. They sent us to a memo Cantor wrote to his fellow Republicans in early September. In it, he told them to expect a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open. Such a resolution, Cantor wrote, would be "at sequester levels" and "contain $64 billion in less spending compared to the current funding levels President Obama signed into law a mere five months ago." If Obama signed off on that, Cantor continued, Obama "would be endorsing a level of spending that wipes away all the increases he and congressional Democrats made while they were in charge and returns us to a pre-2008 level of discretionary spending." Cantor ended his memo on an upbeat note: "Upon return to Washington, if we stay focused on our solutions and how they can benefit all Americans dealing with their everyday challenges, I am convinced we will achieve more significant policy victories in the months ahead." That leaves little doubt that Cantor saw a short-term continuing resolution in a positive light. It wouldn’t necessarily be the resounding victory that Burton suggested but it was something Cantor could say was a net gain for the GOP. We asked Cantor’s office if Burton had captured the gist of Cantor’s memo. "We were simply laying out our legislative agenda at the time," Cantor’s press secretary Megan Whittemore said. "We believe maintaining current spending levels is a good thing, which is why that was included in every one of our CR solutions which passed the House," Whittemore said. "We also believe we must tackle the challenges of ObamaCare, which was also addressed in all of our CR solutions." While Cantor’s memo does lay out a strategy to defund and delay Obamacare, he kept that separate from the section on a continuing resolution. That’s consistent with what we now know was the House Republican leadership plan. Several news articles described a deal struck between House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., back in July. On national television, Boehner did not rebut that there was an understanding that there would be a cut, in the range of $70 billion, in exchange for a clean continuing resolution, one that said nothing about defunding the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Three days after the memo appeared on the Web, the National Review reported that Cantor planned to bring two measures to the floor. One would be the continuing resolution and the other would amend that resolution to defund Obamacare. Both items would go to the Senate separately with the expectation that the Senate would pass the spending resolution and kill the amendment. The president would then be able to sign a clean bill. But a week after that, Cantor’s plan crumbled under pressure from members of his party who were unwilling to compromise. About two dozen House Republicans refused to sign on to any measure that funded Obamacare. Ultimately, they prevailed and the House Republican leadership efforts to avert a shutdown failed. One final note: Burton talked about a budget deal in the middle of a conversation that dealt mainly with the debate over raising the debt ceiling. While the two issues are now linked, there is no evidence that there was ever a deal between Republicans and Democrats on allowing the government’s borrowing limit to rise. On the contrary, even as House Republican leaders were trying to sell their troops on a strategy to keep the government open, they said they wanted a showdown on the debt ceiling. Burton’s comment addressed only half of the current impasse. Our ruling Burton said Democrats had struck a deal to avert a shutdown with Republicans that Cantor considered a win, implying that Republicans were going back on previous agreements. Cantor’s legislative agenda memo from early September is in line with that and described the benefits of that approach. Cantor also attempted to keep that deal alive through a legislative maneuver until tea party members refused to go along. As for whether Cantor called the plan "a win," he didn’t use that word. But he did include it on a list that he said would result in "significant policy victories." Burton’s statement does not apply to the standoff over the debt ceiling, though, which was what he was asked about. On the other hand, it did speak to the broader challenge of negotiating successfully if the parties don’t speak for the block of votes they need to deliver. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-07217	Democratic Reps. Cicilline, Boswell, Carnahan and Critz "demanded that Congress vote to increase the nation’s debt limit without making any spending cuts."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/03/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-robocall-debt-ceiling-spending-cuts/	A House vote on May 31, 2011, on whether to raise the federal debt ceiling -- without dramatic federal spending cuts included -- was seen by many political observers as little more than a vehicle for political posturing. The bill was resoundingly defeated, 318 to 87, with a unanimous Republican caucus joined in opposition by 82 Democrats, some of whom accused Republicans of using the vote to try to score political points. Indeed, two days after the vote, the National Republican Congressional Committee launched a series of robocalls aimed at 11 Democratic House members, accusing them of wanting to raise the federal debt limit without making any spending cuts. Actually, there were two versions of the robocalls. Here's the first: "The national debt is now 14 trillion dollars, and Congressman Jim Himes just voted for two trillion dollars MORE debt….without any budget cuts." That one went out to constituents of John Garamendi, D-Ca., Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., Jim Himes, D-Conn., Rush Holt, D-N.J., Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., Brad Miller, D-N.C., and John Yarmuth, D-Ky.. The second version went like this: "After spending recklessly and maxing out the nation's credit card, (Rep. David) Cicilline demanded that Congress vote to increase the nation’s debt limit without making any spending cuts." That one went out to constituents of Democrats Leonard Boswell (Iowa), Russ Carnahan (Mo.), David Cicilline (R.I.) and Mark Critz (Pa.), Catch the subtle difference there? Yeah, neither did we at first. The group of legislators targeted by the first version actually voted for the bill to raise the debt ceiling. The second group voted no. So how can the NRCC claim in the second version that the four House Democrats "demanded that Congress vote to increase the nation’s debt limit without making any spending cuts"? NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said that refers to a letter penned by Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and signed by the four targeted House members, which calls on Congress to pass a "clean extension of the debt ceiling." "The debt ceiling vote is about one thing: affirming that America pays its bills," the letter states. "It does not authorize new taxpayer obligations; it affirms to the world our commitment to pay obligations already incurred. To do otherwise, or to threaten to do so, or to leverage our duty to pay our bills to achieve a partisan advantage in budget disputes, jeopardizes the full faith and credit of the United States of America." So if the those four Democrats signed the letter, why did they vote against the debt ceiling bill this week? In a written statement explaining his vote, Carnahan said the vote was "a political stunt, and I voted no because we’re not going to fall for it." "Once silly season is over, I look forward to sitting down with Democrats and Republicans, having a serious discussion about reducing the deficit and setting aside our differences to get this done," Carnahan stated. We doubt that most people getting the carefully-worded robocall would pick up on the nuance that, while the targeted legislators "demanded that Congress vote" on the bill, they didn't actually vote for it. The calls also misled by accusing the Democratic congressmen of "spending recklessly and maxing out the nation's credit card." Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio examined a similar claim from a recent NRCC news release that said Rep. Betty Sutton, D-Ohio, "and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out." They rated the claim Barely True, noting that, although Democrats have certainly voted for increased spending over the last two years, it ignores all the other previous spending and borrowing that factored into the debt, such as the war and the Bush tax cuts. They also pointed out that, since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the debt ceiling 10 times, according to the Congressional Research Service. Seven of those hikes were under Bush, three under Obama. The NRCC later earned a Pants on Fire ruling for claiming PolitiFact Ohio confirmed its contention that Betty Sutton "maxed out federal debt." Sam Drzymala, a spokesman for Carnahan, said the NRCC's robocalls also distort Democrats' position on spending cuts. "Congressman Carnahan has always called for cuts that would put our financial house in order," he said. "It's a matter of priorities." When House Republicans passed their budget, Carnahan’s office released a statement April 12, 2011, highlighting the different approaches the two parties have taken with regard to proposed cuts. "I’m deeply disappointed in the extreme proposal put forward by my Republican colleagues," Carnahan stated. "They lack the courage to end taxpayer giveaways to the oil industry, millionaires and profitable companies sending jobs overseas. But –- shockingly –- Republicans want to pay for these handouts by gutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. "Both sides have agreed to serious budget cuts –- but the choice is between responsible cuts and extreme cuts that endanger our fragile recovery and scapegoat our seniors." Drzymala further noted that in 2009, 174 Republicans objected to attaching a debt limit increase to a defense spending bill. "Apparently they wanted a clean vote then," Drzymala said. "Why have they flip-flopped? Because they are playing political games. This is not about substance." A spokeswoman for Cicilline, Jessica Kershaw, said Cicilline's support for the Welch's letter calling for a "clean" debt ceiling bill didn't mean he wasn't committed to cutting federal spending. "Congressman Cicilline believes we have to be serious about cutting government spending and the obligation to pay our bills," Kershaw said. "There is a serious bipartisan effort underway led by the vice president to determine the best way of reducing our nation’s debt, and the congressman believes we should allow that process to proceed. He did not think this week’s vote was a serious effort to tackle the debt because, for example, it assigned responsibility for the entire debt to the president’s FY ’12 budget –- which the House hasn’t even considered." Our fact-check here is whether the four Democrats targeted by the robocall "demanded that Congress vote to increase the nation’s debt limit without making any spending cuts." Again, none of the four actually voted for the bill to raise the debt ceiling. All four did sign a letter in April that sought a "clean" vote on raising the debt ceiling -- one that wasn't directly tied to spending cuts. However, all of the congressmen have gone on record in support of spending cuts independent of the debt ceiling vote. Republicans and Democrats have disagreements about how and where to cut and how much, but that's different than not wanting to make spending cuts at all. We rate the NRCC's claim in the robocalls Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09506	The stimulus includes "$219,000 to study the sex lives of female college freshmen."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/19/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-claims-stimulus-includes-219000-study-se/	In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent. "I was still concerned -- Joe (Biden) and I were just talking in the back -- when this thing passed we said $787 billion -- somewhere there’s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent; $787 billion spent out over 18 months, that's a lot -- that's a lot of money," Obama said. "And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that, as Joe puts it, the dog, so far at least, hasn't barked. " But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell put out a press release titled "Stimulus Anniversary Gifts to Taxpayers: One Year of Spending Taxpayer Dollars Studying Malt Liquor and Marijuana, Researching Drunk Mice, Funding Martini Bars and Steakhouses, and Examining Facebook." It lists 15 stimulus projects. We took a look at several items on this list, as well as a few from House Republican Leader John Boehner to see if they were as billed. In this item, we look at McConnell's claim that the stimulus includes "$219,000 to study the sex lives of female college freshmen." We couldn't resist checking this one out. Especially after reading a Sept. 8, 2009, story in the (Syracuse) Daily Orange, that begins, "Five hundred Syracuse University freshmen will divulge the details of their sex lives as part of a women's health study" ... paid for with $219,000 in stimulus funds. Alas, the academic rendering of the study on the government's stimulus Web site, recovery.gov, doesn't read nearly as provocatively: "Scientific Rationale: The transition from adolescence to adulthood involves important developmental challenges. Events during this key developmental phase can profoundly shape and influence academic and occupational achievement as well as affect health outcomes. During this time, women are particularly vulnerable to a number of health threats including depressive, anxiety and eating disorders; psychosomatic conditions; intimate partner coercion and violence; and sexually transmitted infections. Understanding gender-based health disparities is an important public health goal. Preliminary scientific reports suggest that intimate encounters between partners who have no expectation of a romantic commitment may be increasing and that these encounters may be partly responsible for gender-based health disparities. However, little research has investigated the health consequences of such encounters using a large sample, a longitudinal design, reliable and valid measures, and sophisticated data analyses." Later, it's translated more plainly: They will study the physical and mental health consequences of hookups. In other words, this is a public health study (funded through the Department of Health and Human Services), not a submission to Penthouse. The two-year survey will track health-related behaviors such as tobacco use, alcohol use, exercise and physical activity, sleep and sexual behavior as well as psychosomatic and mental health symptoms. The findings will be used "to inform parents, educators, medical and public health professionals, and to guide the development of more effective health promotion and disease prevention programs." In the Daily Orange story, the man conducting the study, Syracuse University professor of psychology and medicine Michael Carey, defended it as a worthwhile study that will help improve approaches to intervention in women's health. "The Women's Health Project includes sexual behavior … because of the increasing recognition that social and health problems are linked to sexual behavior … and that there has been little scientific study of the topic despite its potential health implications," Carey said. "Women have been traditionally neglected in health research, even though they are disproportionately vulnerable to a number of health threats," such as sexually transmitted diseases and eating disorders, Carey said. Although Carey applied to the National Institutes of Health for funding long before the stimulus was even being considered, he said stimulus funds are appropriate for the study. "The funds invested in this project do help to support jobs and will quickly find their way back into the local economy," Carey said. "Moreover, investing in health and health research is as important to the revitalization of our economy as are investments in our physical infrastructure." As for the jobs, there won't be many direct ones. According to the recovery.gov synopsis, the study will involve a half-time research assistant and part-time temporary assistants. While McConnell's characterization of the study packs a good political punch, we think the actual study isn't nearly as ... sexy ... as he makes it out to be. It's a public health study. And so we rule this claim Half True.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2010-02-19T18:00:51	2010-02-17	['None']

pomt-09338	“This race will be the Democrats’ top target this November.”	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/11/debra-lehrmann/high-court-hopeful-lehrmann-race-will-be-dems-top-/	Angling to win Tuesday's runoff to be the Republican nominee for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, Debra Lehrmann said in a recent mailer that the GOP must nominate a strong candidate in the general election because “this race will be the Democrats’ top target in November.” In a year with numerous statewide offices, including governor, up for grabs, we wondered whether a seat on the state’s highest civil court is really going to top Texas Democrats' priorities. First, a little background: Lehrmann, who has been a judge in Tarrant County for more than 20 years, and Rick Green, a lawyer and former Texas House member from Dripping Springs, were the top vote-getters among six candidates for the court’s Place 3 seat in the March 2 GOP primary. The runoff is happening because neither received more than half the vote. In response to our inquiry, Lehrmann’s campaign spokesman, Craig Murphy, quickly added a big "if" to the prediction in Lehrmann's mailer. Murphy said Democrats would zero in on the court race if Green wins the GOP runoff, because that would boost Democratic nominee Jim Sharp's chances of winning the seat. Green “would definitely be their No. 1 target if he managed to get the nomination,” Murphy said. Murphy said he's not the only one who thinks so, pointing us to political commentary from three publications: Texas Monthly, the Austin Chronicle and a pro-Democratic blog, the Burnt Orange Report. Two days after the party primaries, Texas Monthly's Paul Burka, a longtime observer of politics, wrote on his blog that “unexpected developments” could test his oft-repeated assertion that Democrats, aside from gubernatorial hopeful Bill White, do not have a chance of winning a statewide race this year. (Democrats haven’t won a statewide office since 1994.) Burka said two contests could prove him wrong. He called Railroad Commission nominee Jeff Weems the Democrats’ “best shot” and mentioned the Place 3 Supreme Court race as “another possibility,” adding that if Green wins the GOP runoff, Sharp, a Houston appellate judge, “might get a lot of backing from the state’s legal community.” On April 2, the Austin Chronicle's endorsement of Lehrmann in the runoff noted that "serious Republicans and their political organizations" might worry that a Green nomination makes "a November Democratic victory much more likely." Earlier, in a post-primary post, the Burnt Orange Report said that if Green wins the runoff, "we've got to make sure folks pay close attention to this race now through November." Why do Murphy and others consider Green a weak candidate? Murphy said one reason is that Green has been beaten by a Democrat before: In 2002, he lost his Texas House seat to Democratic challenger Patrick Rose. Other critics of Green's candidacy have focused on his lack of judicial experience and several episodes from his past, including the taping of an infomercial in the Capitol and his admitted swing at Rose outside a Hays County polling place in 2006. After the 2001 legislative session, Texas Monthly named Green one of the 10 worst legislators for what the magazine termed "ethical pratfalls." In a YouTube video titled "Are the accusations true?" and posted April 4, Green says the ethics issues have been dredged up to sink his candidacy, although he acknowledges hitting Rose and has apologized. We asked Sharp, who did not have a primary opponent, if his judicial race will be his party's top target, whether or not Green is his opponent. “I can tell you uncategorically that it is not," Sharp said. Sharp said the Texas Democratic Party “will not be persuaded by anything to do anything but what their agenda is, and the agenda is legislative seats” and the governorship -- an agenda that he said has not changed since at least 2004. Kirsten Gray, a spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, echoed that assessment. “The Texas Supreme Court races are certainly very important to Texas Democrats,” she said. “However, these races are not more important than the governor’s office, taking a majority of seats in the (Texas) House and winning other statewide offices.” Ed Sills, communications director for the Texas AFL-CIO, said that "any Democrat would probably say the top target in November is the governor's office." One sign of a party's priorities is how much money a candidate attracts. Sharp did not tell us precisely how much money he has raised this year, saying only that the amount is "still in the four-figure range." Meanwhile, Bill White, the Democratic Party's gubernatorial nominee, reported more than $2.2 million in political contributions gathered from Jan. 22 to Feb. 20. Still, the fact that the Democrats are fielding candidates for all three Supreme Court races this year represents an uptick of sorts. In 2006, the last time gubernatorial and Supreme Court candidates were on the same ballot, the Democrats put up only one contender in the five high court races: Bill Moody, a state district judge in El Paso who lost to incumbent Republican Don Willett. In the last 30-day reporting period before the general election that year, Moody spent $23,434 while Chris Bell, the Democratic nominee for governor, reported spending $2.9 million. Where does all this leave Lehrmann's statement? We didn't find anyone who agreed with Lehrmann that the Supreme Court seat would be the Democrats' top fall target -- or any other indicators, such as surging campaign donations. Besides, her campaign's explanation for the statement includes a caveat -- a Green runoff victory -- that was not spelled out in her mailer. We rate her speculative statement as False.

pomt-04282	"After Patrick Murphy’s charges were dropped, Murphy’s father gave the prosecutor a huge campaign donation."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/02/allen-west/allen-west-ad-connects-patrick-mur/	The battle between U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, and Democratic opponent Patrick Murphy has featured dueling ads in which they portray each other as criminals. And now West has reloaded his attack with a dramatic ad that suggests that when Murphy was arrested when he was a college freshman after a night of drinking and swearing at a police officer, his well-to-do Daddy got the case dismissed. Earlier in the campaign, West ran an ad that attacked Murphy for an arrest about 10 years ago -- the charge was ultimately transferred to traffic court where it was dismissed. And Murphy attacked West for an incident during his Army career, when West fired over the head of a detainee in Iraq and prompted a military investigation. That led to a fine and reprimand, and West retired from the Army. You can read more about our analysis of those ads in our earlier fact-checks in the race for congressional district 18 in Florida’s Treasure Coast. Here we will focus on West’s latest attacks about Murphy’s 2003 arrest in this ad: The narrator begins: "Patrick Murphy isn’t being honest about his drunken assault of a police officer." The ad then shows Murphy saying: "I took responsibility and it was dismissed." The narrator then continues: "The truth is after Murphy’s charges were dropped, Murphy’s father gave the prosecutor a huge campaign donation." On screen, two men in suits shake hands in a stairwell; another image shows someone pushing stacks of cash across a table. "Now Murphy is hiding behind his dad again using his money to fund a negative campaign. ... " The ad paints a portrait of Murphy as relying on his Daddy’s big bucks to get him out of trouble and support his campaign. (West has called Murphy a "spoiled brat.") Here we will focus on West’s claim that that after the charges against Patrick Murphy were dropped, his father "gave the prosecutor a huge campaign donation." We will also briefly explain West’s reference to the role of Murphy’s father’s money in the campaign. Murphy’s 2003 arrest We previously fact-checked a West ad that accused Murphy of trying "To hide his drunken assault of a police officer." We ruled that claim Mostly False, because Murphy wasn’t charged with assault, the case was ultimately dropped, and there was no evidence that he tried to hide the 2003 incident. At the time, Murphy was a 19-year-old college freshman at the University of Miami; he’s now 29. According to the police report, Murphy and a friend were fighting and disrupting others at a Miami Beach bar, Club Crobar, and escorted out by security. The two men had been drinking, were "soaking wet" from alcohol and had "eyes bloodshot, slurring speech." An officer asked Murphy for his I.D., but Murphy refused to turn over the fake New Jersey driver’s license. "Defendant refused shouting ‘(expletive) you,’’’ and was arrested, the report stated. To be clear, we saw no evidence in the officer’s narrative or court records that Murphy physically assaulted a police officer. Murphy was charged with felony possession of a stolen driver’s license. He entered a plea of "not guilty" Feb. 26, and the criminal case was closed March 10 with a charge transferred to traffic court. Court records also list "misdemeanor disorderly intoxication" based on the arrest report, but court records show "no action" on this count, and he wasn’t charged for that by prosecutors. The charge for altering a driver’s license was dismissed by the state attorney’s office in June 2003. The online record doesn’t explain the reason for the dismissal. Donations by Thomas Murphy to Katherine Fernandez Rundle West’s new ad continues the focus on the same incident, this time looking at campaign donations made by Patrick’s father Thomas P. Murphy and his construction businesses to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. Fernandez Rundle has been the county’s top prosecutor since March 1993. The West campaign cited three $500 donations by Coastal firms for a total of $1,500 in 2004 -- the year after Murphy’s case was dropped. We also searched state contribution records and did not find any additional donations from Thomas Murphy or Coastal Construction for Fernandez Rundle, a Democrat, in 2004. But we also found that Thomas Murphy gave $500 in 2000 -- a few years before his son’s arrest. Coastal firms gave a total of $2,500 to Fernandez Rundle’s campaign years later, in 2012. (She didn’t face an opponent in 2008.) In each race, the donations were a small drop in Fernandez Rundle’s six-figure war chests -- she raised about $800,000 in 2004. Fernandez Rundle easily won her races in 2004 and 2012. We asked West campaign manager Tim Edson if he found any evidence that Murphy’s father and his donations influenced his son’s case being dropped. "In the TV ad we ran, we just laid the case out," Edson said. "If you are fact-checking the ad, the ad does not say there was any direct correlation. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide. Somebody’s charges were dropped inexplicably, yet campaign contributions were made. It is a fair question to be asked. The public can make a decision for themselves." But we found there wasn’t anything particularly special about the donations from Thomas Murphy or his companies to Fernandez Rundle. State and federal records show that Thomas Murphy or his firm has donated to dozens of candidates or political groups for both major parties for a variety of offices including presidential, U.S. Senate, statewide positions and the state Legislature since the late 1990s. State records show Coastal Construction donated a total of about $136,000 to candidates and political committees between 1997 and 2012. Two of the largest state donations by Coastal Construction were $25,000 to the Republican Party of Florida in 1998 and $50,000 to a committee that supported Democrat Alex Sink’s 2010 bid for governor. Coastal Condominiums also gave $50,000 to the RPOF in 2002. In a business story in the Miami Herald about Coastal Construction, it states that Patrick Murphy’s campaign did cause his father to stop some political activity: fundraising for Republican Mitt Romney for president. Murphys’ relationship with Fernandez Rundle Thomas Murphy didn’t respond to our interview requests, but we did contact his son’s campaign and Fernandez Rundle’s office. Murphy campaign consultant Eric Johnson said that Thomas Murphy has known Fernandez Rundle for several years through the "political world." Fernandez Rundle said that she knew Thomas Murphy for years but had never met Patrick Murphy until recently. She had seen Thomas Murphy at community or charitable events for years. Both Johnson and Fernandez Rundle said that Thomas Murphy did not contact her about his son’s arrest. "This recent focus on a case from 2003 is the first I’ve heard of the matter...," Fernandez Rundle wrote in an email. "Based upon the assistant state attorney’s interview with the arresting police officer, it was determined that the facts of the specific case could not support a belief that the charges could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As a result, the disorderly intoxication charge was dropped and the possession of a stolen driver’s license (for the false I.D.) was directed to traffic court." Thomas Murphy’s PAC West’s ad also says, "Now Murphy is hiding behind his dad again using his money to fund a negative campaign." That’s a reference to the American Sunrise PAC that is largely funded by Murphy’s father who gave $250,000. The PAC aired an ad depicting a caricature of West, who is African-American, in boxing gloves punching an old white woman, a younger white woman and grabbing money from a black family. The ad was intended to depict West socking it to constituents over Medicare, health care and tax cuts. West and his supporters argued the ad was racist, but the NAACP disagreed. (A Palm Beach Post editorial said the ad wasn’t racist but criticized Murphy for saying he had nothing to do with an ad created by his father.) Our ruling West’s ad says "After Patrick Murphy’s charges were dropped, Murphy’s father gave the prosecutor a huge campaign donation." There is a sliver of truth here: After the 2003 case against Murphy was dropped, his father’s companies gave $1,500 to Fernandez Rundle’s re-election campaign. Murphy’s father also gave $500 to Fernandez Rundle in 2000. But there are two significant problems with this claim. First, we wouldn’t call $1,500 in donations "huge." They weren’t huge for Fernandez Rundle, who raised about $800,000 in her 2004 campaign. And the amount wasn’t huge for the companies, either. They had given five-figure donations to the Republican Party of Florida in the past -- and $50,000 to Sink since then. West’s campaign emphasized that the ad simply lays out the facts for the viewers to decide. But the ad’s images of shadowy meetings and large piles of cash leave viewers with the impression that there was an exchange of campaign donations for Murphy’s case being dropped. We see no evidence to prove that connection. We rate this ad Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/58a519ec-7e6d-42a1-92ad-c52ef570758f	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2012-11-02T15:38:45	2012-10-25	['None']

pomt-13666	"Then, the Republican leader theatrically introduced new bills with stopgap budget language, declaring that we could stay until midnight and pass this compromise. Except under our constitution, a bill has to be read on 3 different days, so that's not possible."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2016/aug/04/kelly-cassidy/never-mind-constitution-illinois-lawmaking-where-t/	The bitter, partisan acrimony that has defined relations between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democrat-dominated Illinois General Assembly blew up in the final hours of the spring legislative session on May 31. After insisting for more than a year that he would not endorse anything short of a full-year budget that included some of his Turnaround Agenda’s business and political reforms, Rauner changed his position on the session’s final day when he -- through the Republican leaders in the General Assembly -- introduced bills to fund P-12 education for a full year and to fund basic state government services through the end of the calendar year. When Democrats declined to take up Rauner’s bills, the governor and Republican lawmakers held a press conference at the grand staircase in the Capitol rotunda at which Rauner declared the spring session a "stunning failure by the supermajority Democrats who control our Legislature." Speaking six hours before the midnight deadline, Rauner called on Democrats to pass the GOP budget bills before the scheduled adjournment of the House and Senate. "We have seen the majority Democrats introduce 500-page bills and vote on them within an hour or two," Rauner said. The GOP press conference stoked partisan tensions and prompted this Facebook post from state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago: Cassidy’s post expressed frustration felt by many Democrats who had been working behind the scenes with their Republican counterparts on a possible budget compromise. But it also implied that the governor was unaware of parliamentary procedure in the General Assembly: "Then, the Republican leader theatrically introduced new bills with stopgap budget language, declaring that we could stay until midnight and pass this compromise. Except under our constitution, a bill has to be read on 3 different days, so that's not possible." Were Rauner and Republican leaders really advocating the impossible? We decided to check. By the book Article IV, Section 8, subsection d of the Illinois Constitution defines the reading requirement for bills in the Illinois General Assembly: (d) A bill shall be read by title on three different days in each house. A bill and each amendment thereto shall be reproduced and placed on the desk of each member before final passage. Going by that requirement, Cassidy is correct. Bills debated at 6 p.m. could not be passed by the House and Senate by midnight. In fact, it would take five calendar days, says Kent Redfield, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield. But once a bill is introduced and its title read in the House and Senate as required by the constitution, it can be held throughout a legislative session and amended at a moment’s notice. Such a bill is called a "shell" or "vehicle" bill, and the amendment tacked onto it can be an entire bill itself. Therefore, the GOP budget text could have been added as an amendment to a shell bill that already had fulfilled the constitutional reading requirement. "It's sort of like a freight train; the boxcars can be empty all along the route, station after station, then suddenly get filled at the last minute before the final stop," says Charles Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting graduate program at the University of Illinois-Springfield. At the May 31 press conference, Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno addressed the procedural question. "It is true we have introduced new bills but there are vehicles in both chambers that can get the job done by midnight," Radogno said. "We’ve seen in hundreds of examples, where there’s a will there’s a way." Cassidy said she believed otherwise when she made her Facebook post. "From what I was hearing, we were out of shells," she said. Practical and political In his quote above from May 31, Rauner noted that shell bills often have been used in Illinois by Democrats to drop large and often controversial bills onto Republicans’ desks with very little time for review and debate. Having shell bills readily available can serve a practical as well as a political purpose. It allows swift passage of legislation to respond to an emergency, for example. State constitutions vary in their methods, but they generally allow some provision for lawmakers and governors to speed up the legislative process. (A list of the states’ reading requirements for passing bills is here.) "A lot of constitutions have waiver language so in emergencies they have the ability to compress the time frame," says Brenda Erickson, senior research analyst with the National Council of State Legislatures. "The two-word synopsis of legislative processes is ‘it varies.’" Illinois does not allow lawmakers to waive the three-reading requirement, so keeping shell bills in reserve for quick amendment and passage is the fallback. The only limitation is that the bill be limited to a single subject, though it grants lawmakers wide latitude. The Republicans’ budget bills on May 31, for example, needed to go on shell bills for appropriations. That would not have been a problem on the evening of May 31, had Rauner and the General Assembly’s Democratic leaders -- House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton -- managed to hammer out an agreement in the final hours. "Cullerton and Madigan had several vehicles in place, and were able to use them… for the ultimate deal that passed on June 30," Wheeler said. The bill ultimately amended to become the stopgap budget, SB 2047, was a shell bill originally introduced in March 2015 to appropriate $2 to the General Assembly’s Legislative Research Bureau. It needed only a third reading in the House for approval. The amendment that contains the spending plan, House Amendment 5, was introduced, passed and signed into law in a single day on June 30. Our ruling Cassidy said Rauner "theatrically introduced new bills with stopgap budget language, declaring that we could stay until midnight and pass this compromise. Except under our constitution, a bill has to be read on 3 different days, so that's not possible." She is correct from a strict interpretation of the rules in the state constitution, in which it takes a minimum of five calendar days from introduction to passage of a bill. But the Illinois Constitution in theory and Illinois lawmaking in practice at times operate more as distant cousins than identical twins. As Wheeler notes, the use of "shell" or "vehicle" bills is a common practice in Springfield, and Madigan and Cullerton used the procedure to make SB 2047 into the stopgap plan a few weeks later -- when Democrats and Republicans managed a fragile truce in their ongoing battle. Cassidy is no novice in the workings of the General Assembly. Before joining the House in 2011, she had served as a legislative aide to Cullerton and a lobbyist for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. It’s reasonable to believe she should have known it was highly unlikely that the General Assembly would have no shell bills available in the final hours before the budget deadline. As Republican Leader Radogno said on May 31, "Where there’s a will there’s a way."

pomt-10872	"(McCain) was opposed to ethanol. Now he's for it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/23/mitt-romney/mccain-has-come-around-to-favor-ethanol/	On ethanol, McCain has maintained a long-standing opposition to subsidies for the alternative fuel and that hasn't changed. But the way he talks about ethanol has changed significantly. In 1999, he told an audience in Iowa, where corn-based ethanol is popular: "I'm here to tell you the things you don't want to hear as well as the things you want to hear. One of those things is ethanol. Ethanol is not worth it. It does not help the consumers. … Those ethanol subsidies should be phased out. And everybody here on this stage, if it wasn't for the fact that Iowa is the first caucus state, would share my view that we don't need ethanol subsidies." In 2007, McCain started to speak more favorably of ethanol and admitted it was a position change. He told Tim Russert on "Meet the Press": "It makes a lot of sense. We are dependent on foreign oil too much. We have a situation where greenhouse gases has now become--emissions has become a vital issue. I am for sugarcane, biofuels, switch grass, and corn-based ethanol because of our need for independence on foreign oil. … I have adjusted to the realities of the world we live in today, and if I don't adjust to those realities, then I would be stuck in the past." That's a significant change in opinion on the biofuel. We found the statement that McCain used to oppose ethanol but now supports it to be Mostly True.

pomt-11325	Says that unless the recipient called back about "your tax filings," you "will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/apr/11/anonymous-caller/anonymous-caller-warns-police-arrest-taxes-call-ba/	A phone message from a New York area code about "your tax filings" ominously indicated that if the Texas recipient didn’t call back soon, jail time and legal action loomed. By all indications, though, the message fielded April 10, 2018 by an Austin resident from a number with the 607 area code was a scam. Significantly, agencies say, anyone getting such a call should hang up and consider filing a complaint with an independent arm of the U.S. Treasury. Warning message We transcribed the warning, which was left as a voice mail on a cell phone with a number starting with the 512 area code. In the message, an automated voice said: "We have received a notification regarding your tax filings from the headquarters which will get expired in next 24 working hours. And once it gets expired after that, you will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name at this moment. We would request you to get back to us so that we can discuss about this case before taking any legal action against you." Federal agency battles criminal callers Next, we hunted for governmental guidance about such calls. In a March 2016 press release, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration stressed that if the IRS wants a taxpayer’s attention, the first contact is generally through the U.S. mail. Also, the IRS "will not ask for payment using a prepaid debit card, a money order or a wire transfer. The IRS also will not ask for a credit card number or your bank information over the phone," TIGTA said. At the time, TIGTA said it had fielded reports of some 5,500 victims collectively paying about $29 million "as a result of the scam in which criminals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials and demanding that they send them cash via prepaid debit cards, money orders or wire transfers from their banks." In December 2017, TIGTA issued a fresh release stating that from October 2013 through mid-November 2017, more than 2.1 million taxpayers reported receiving phone contacts from scammers--with over 12,400 victims collectively reporting payments of more than $61.6 million due to the scam. The TIGTA inspector general, J. Russell George, said in the release that such scammers "are only succeeding with a handful of victims. On average, between 30 and 40 new victims each week report that they paid the impersonators money. This is a vast improvement over the hundreds of new victims who were reporting last year that they paid the impersonators money." When we emailed our transcript of the April 2018 phone message to TIGTA, spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar replied by email: "TIGTA has made many arrests in connection with this scam and has numerous investigations underway. To date, as a result of our efforts, a total of 111 individuals have been charged in federal court for their involvement in IRS impersonation scam activity. Even so, we are still receiving reports that between 4,000 and 10,000 taxpayers are receiving calls each week, so our work is ongoing." State and local agencies comment We also shared our transcript of the phone message with the Austin Police Department and the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which has a consumer protection function. Lisa Cortinas of the APD emailed us a 2017 APD press release describing a scam in which callers purported to represent the IRS with the incoming phone number showing up as an APD number. "These scammers are not legitimate," the release said. Kayleigh Lovvorn of the attorney general’s office told us by email: "This is a very common ‘IRS scam’ that usually increases at tax time across the entire country." Lovvorn pointed out a 2017 Paxton press release stating: "Scam artists tell consumers that they owe back taxes and threaten to have them arrested if they don’t provide immediate payment." Advice: Hang up The TIGTA inspector general said in the agency’s 2016 release: "If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS or in a new twist, the Treasury Department, and uses the threat of legal action if you do not pay immediately, that is a sign that it is not the IRS calling, and your cue to hang up. "Again," George said then, "do not engage with these callers. If they call you, hang up the telephone." The APD and Paxton releases each had the same advice. Our ruling An automated phone message fielded in Austin said that unless the recipient called back about "your tax filings," you "will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name." Relevant federal, state and local agencies say there’s no legitimacy to such calls, which should be reported to authorities. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-09855	Ezekiel Emanuel, one of President Obama's key health care advisers, "says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/12/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-obama-health-adviser-thinks-health-c/	Update: After we published this item, Ezekiel Emanuel responded at length to these claims in an interview with ABC News. See the interview here . You know Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's intense chief of staff. And maybe you've heard of his brother, Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood talent agent who provided the inspiration for the Ari Gold character on HBO's Entourage . Now a third Emanuel brother, Ezekiel Emanuel, has been thrust into the spotlight. Ezekiel Emanuel is a health policy adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget, and is a member of the Federal Council on Comparative Effectiveness Research, but until last week, he had largely flown under radar of the national political media. That changed when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a statement from the floor of the House on July 27 in which she said the American public needed to know what the people who advise Obama about health care reform think. Specifically, she said, Dr. Emanuel "says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled." Emanuel is a well-known oncologist and bioethicist, which means he ponders such moral questions as "You have three people who need a liver, but you've got just one liver, who gets it?" Like other academics (see our article on claims about science czar John Holdren ), Emanuel has found that highbrow articles for academic journals make great fodder for opponents trying to score political points. Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them. Bachmann's comments from the House floor substantially repeat claims made in a July 24, 2009, New York Post op-ed piece written by Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York. Under the headline, "Deadly Doctors: O Advisers Want to Ration Care," McCaughey argues that "Emanuel wants doctors to look beyond the needs of their patients and consider social justice, such as whether the money could be better spent on somebody else. "Many doctors are horrified by this notion; they'll tell you that a doctor's job is to achieve social justice one patient at a time. "Emanuel, however, believes that 'communitarianism' should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled, not given to those 'who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens. . . . An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.' (Hastings Center Report, Nov.-Dec. '96). "Translation: Don't give much care to a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy." Bachmann quoted heavily from McCaughey's op-ed in her floor statement, and sprinkled in her own two cents. Here's what Bachmann said: "The president's adviser, Dr. Emanuel, believes communitarianism should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled." She noted, "We just lost my father-in-law to dementia two months ago. I thank God that the doctors were able to alleviate my poor father-in-law's symptoms at the end of his life at age 85. Apparently, under the Democrats' health care plan, my father-in-law would not have received the high quality of care that he received in his last two months of life. Or if you're a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy, watch out." The quote in question comes from an essay Emanuel wrote for the Hastings Center Report in the November-December 1996 issue. It ran under the title, "Where Civic Republicanism and Deliberative Democracy Meet." The title alone should give you an idea of the kind of academic, philosophical discussion that will ensue. In the article, he addresses the idea of what's good for society at large when it comes to allocating health care resources, and that it "suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be guaranteed." Under that philosophy, he writes, health services would be guaranteed to ensure the health of future generations as well as for "full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations." That's the lead-in to the part that contains the stuff McCaughey cited: "Conversely, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia. A less obvious example is guaranteeing neuropsychological services to ensure children with learning disabilities can read and learn to reason." So the question is, is Emanuel saying that he thinks health services ought not to be guaranteed to patients with dementia? No, said Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the White House Office of Budget and Management. "He just unequivocally doesn't believe that." In fact, he said, one need look only as far as the next paragraph: "Clearly more needs to be done to elucidate what specific health care services are basic; however, the overlap between liberalism and communitarianism points to a way of introducing the good back into medical ethics and devising a principled way of distinguishing basic from discretionary health care services." Yeah, we sorta got lost there too. What it means, Baer said, is that Emanuel was exploring different views of political theory as they apply to health care decisions and following one school of thought through to the point where he notes that it would lead to "potentially disturbing types of policy ramifications." Furthermore, he said, you need to balance McCaughey's claim against Emanuel's 25-year record of caring for very sick people, and specifically providing quality care to very ill patients at the end of their life. "He's a little surprised at how his record is being twisted and turned," Baer said. "It is preposterous that Ezekiel Emanuel would deny care to someone who needed it, or that he believes we should be making the sort of horrific medical decisions he's been accused of." Some of Emanuel's academic writing is confusing for nonacademics. But Emanuel has also written extensively in more mainstream media — the Atlantic and Wall Street Journal , for example — about his opposition to euthanasia and his belief in appropriate end-of-life care. Here's a quote from a Jan. 7, 1997, commentary written by Emanuel for the Wall Street Journal : "For the millions of others, legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide would be of no benefit. To the contrary, it would be a way of avoiding the complex and arduous efforts required of doctors and other health-care providers to ensure that dying patients receive humane, dignified care." There's no question Emanuel has written some things that some would consider controversial. For example, in another paper cited by McCaughey, a June 18, 2008 commentary for the Journal of the American Medical Association , Emanuel talks about how overutilization of health care is the most important contributor to the cost of health care in America. He takes aim at a medical culture that rewards "meticulousness, not effectiveness" and leads to a mindset in which doctors view it as "imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of cost or effect on others." He concludes that in order to rein in costs, we ought to "devise financial incentives for physicians and patients that result in greater health care value." Those kinds of opinions are fair game for political debate. And we certainly think it's fair to question where such ideas might lead in a practical sense. Emanuel is a key health care adviser. But to make the sensational claim that Emanuel says health care should not be extended to the disabled is a gross distortion of his position, lifted out of context from an academic paper in which he poses philosophical ideas but doesn't necessary endorse them. Emanuel's hefty medical record also counts for something, as well his unequivocal public position against euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide. We rule Bachmann's statement False.

pomt-07021	From 1947 to 1979, family incomes for rich, middle-income and poor Americans grew about the same rate. But since 1979, incomes for rich families have grown much faster.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/05/united-fair-economy/liberal-group-says-family-incomes-grew-equally-pri/	A reader recently sent us a chart posted at the website of MoveOn.org, a liberal group. It aimed to show how incomes across the board rose from the end of World War II until 1979. But then, starting in 1979, they slowed for lower-income Americans while accelerating dramatically for the richest. The graphic was produced by the group United for a Fair Economy, a group that "raises awareness that concentrated wealth and power undermine the economy, corrupt democracy, deepen the racial divide, and tear communities apart." Previously, we rated a bumper sticker the group produced. The group’s chart represents the growth in income for various income groupings as flowers, with the height of the flower proportionate to the size of the increase. The text says, "Comparing the growth of U.S. family incomes. 1947-1979 we grew together. 1979-2008 we grew apart." The chart provided these statistics for the two periods: 1947-1979: Bottom 20 percent of the income distribution: 118 percent increase Second-to-bottom 20 percent: 100 percent increase Middle 20 percent: 111 percent increase Second-to-highest 20 percent: 114 percent increase Highest 20 percent: 99 percent increase Highest 5 percent: 86 percent increase 1979-2008: Bottom 20 percent of the income distribution: 7 percent decrease Second-to-bottom 20 percent: 6 percent increase Middle 20 percent: 11 percent increase Second-to-highest 20 percent: 23 percent increase Highest 20 percent: 49 percent increase Highest 5 percent: 73 percent increase Highest 1 percent: 224 percent increase We tracked down the raw data the group used for its calculations, and the group later confirmed that they had used the same statistics in assembling the graph. All but one of the categories -- the calculation for the highest 1 percent -- came from figures published by the U.S. Census Bureau, a source we consider reliable. For the 1979 -2008 Census data, the increases in the chart can be calculated directly. For the 1947-1979 Census data, the figures have to be reverse-engineered, but we were able to replicate the group’s methodology without much difficulty. In both cases, we used inflation-adjusted figures. Ultimately, our calculations came up with some slightly different numbers, but the tallies were extremely close. For 1947 to 1979, our increases ranged from 81 percent to 122 percent, depending on the income group, while United for a Fair Economy came up with a range of 86 percent to 118 percent. For 1979 to 2008, our numbers ranged from a 4 percent decrease to a 73 percent increase, while United for a Fair Economy ranged from a 7 percent decrease to a 73 percent increase. Since the numbers are close -- and more importantly, since they showed the same overall pattern -- we aren’t going to quibble over the differences. And what about that final statistic, on the income growth for the top 1 percent from 1979 to 2008? The group pointed to data from economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who have amassed a trove of data on income inequality. We ran the numbers and came up with a 169 percent increase for the top 1 percent between 1979 and 2008. That’s less than the 224 percent indicated in the chart. The number is closer if you take the top half of 1 percent -- 213 percent. But even that doesn’t quite get you there. Economists we contacted suggested that the numbers may have been adjusted to include capital gains, since the original Piketty-Saez data set excluded capital gains, and capital gains are an important income source for the very wealthy. But even if United for a Fair Economy’s final number is off, it’s still a whopping increase in income compared to the statistics for lower- and middle-income brackets. We also checked with a range of economists to see if the comparison the group was making was somehow unfair. To one degree or another, each of our experts said the comparison was acceptable. "My impression is that you would find basically the same story using any available tabulation of the inflation-adjusted income series for the U.S.," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, noted some methodological imperfections with these kinds of studies -- including their failure to account for the value of employer-provided health care and Medicare -- but he said he doesn’t doubt the overall trend. "When all is said and done, there is fairly uniform consensus that starting in the late 1970s, the distribution of income in society became significantly more unequal," he said. Two conservative economists -- Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute and J.D. Foster of the Heritage Foundation -- raised some of the same methodological concerns as Steuerle, and they also warned against drawing broader conclusions than the data can support. For instance, both noted that the chart, striking as it is, doesn’t say that someone in the lowest 20 percent is doomed to stay there. "When you add income mobility to the equation, the left's rich-get-richer-and-poor-get-poorer story gets rather blurry," Mitchell said. Still, despite some modest differences in the final numbers, the story told by the United for a Fair Economy chart strikes us as pretty accurate. So we rate the chart Mostly True.

pomt-04864	Says the Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force "is the first task force of its kind in Central Ohio"	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/10/mike-dewine/ohio-attorney-general-mike-dewine-says-task-force-/	In this partisan election year, Statehouse Democrats and Republicans were able to come together on a significant piece of legislation further cracking down on human trafficking. Only about a year earlier, Ohio finally joined 44 other states with laws specifically addressing a crime akin to modern-day slavery. Human trafficking is the act of forcing an individual into acts of labor. The type of human trafficking that has received the most attention in Ohio is sex trafficking — in most cases, men forcing girls or young women to be sex slaves. A 2010 state report from former Attorney General Richard Cordray concluded that just over 1,000 American-born children are forced to become sex slaves each year in Ohio. That report by Cordray’s Ohio Trafficking in Persons Study Commission grabbed the attention of lawmakers, who rebuffed suggestions by the Ohio Prosecutors Association that existing laws were sufficient to address the problem. In fact, many law enforcement groups said they were already diligently watching for and investigating human trafficking incidents. And previous attorneys general and other elected officials have studied the issue and called for tougher laws. So it was surprising for PolitiFact Ohio to hear current Attorney General Mike DeWine recently claim that he was the first person to appoint a criminal task force to investigate human trafficking in the Columbus region, the state’s most populated area. "This is the first task force of its kind in Central Ohio," DeWine boasted in an Aug. 2 news release announcing the indictment of four Chillicothe, Ohio residents in a case brought by his Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force. There are already such task forces in Cleveland and Toledo that have been active for years — law enforcement collaborations with city, county, state and federal officials. In fact, Toledo recently was rated as the fourth-worst city for human trafficking in the country. DeWine’s task force is mainly made up of Columbus police officers but also includes officials from the attorney general’s investigative unit, a suburban Columbus police department, the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Law enforcement agencies in Central Ohio have long investigated human trafficking, without officially calling themselves a task force. Because this crime often involves bringing victims across state lines and even from other countries, it often takes a more collaborative effort with federal officials to make these charges stick. Columbus police have "done that work for a number of years and we've had some partners, but we haven't called it a task force. It’s just been guys that wanted to get the job done and came together and did it," said Columbus Police Lt. Mark Lang, who is director of DeWine's trafficking task force. Some will recall that Cordray, a Democrat, appointed a commission that studied the issue and he then strongly supported a bill to strengthen laws against human trafficking. And Republican Gov. John Kasich in March signed an executive order forming his own Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force (not to be confused with DeWine’s Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force). But while Kasich’s task force is based in Central Ohio, the governor’s unit is not a criminal investigative operation. Instead, it is primarily a group that studied how deeply rooted human trafficking is in Ohio and issued a report of its findings this summer that had conclusions and figures similar to Cordray’s report two years earlier. DeWine also has a commission studying this issue, which just released a report analyzing sex trafficking in Ohio. Given that DeWine’s task force is a law enforcement investigative unit armed with a tougher state law, we believe he is safe in claiming that his is the first such task force in Central Ohio. But for some, it might be a matter of semantics — a commission versus a task force versus a law enforcement collaboration without a name. DeWine certainly isn’t the first public official to shed light on this problem and look for solutions, so his boast might be misinterpreted. Additional information is needed for clarification.

pomt-13255	"Workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/17/donald-trump/trump-says-workers-making-less-working-harder-20-y/	Donald Trump attracted the most attention at an Oct. 13 rally in Florida for denying allegations that he had groped multiple women and for floating a variety of conspiracy theories. But he also offered some economic statistics. At one point, he told the crowd in West Palm Beach, "Workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder." When we looked at the data, we found that it wasn’t quite so simple. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) U.S. workers are actually making slightly more than they were 20 years ago, not less To understand the first part of Trump’s claim, we looked at statistics for median, weekly, inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 and over going back just over 20 years. The chart, using data compiled from from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows that between 1995 and 2015, inflation-adjusted median weekly earnings rose from $314 to $341. The extra $27 in median weekly earnings is an increase of just under 9 percent over 20 years — not necessarily a very impressive increase, but an increase nonetheless. It’s also higher today than it was in any year other than 2009 and (barely) 2010. So on this point, Trump is incorrect. Americans are not working longer Next, we looked at data for the average number of hours worked annually. There is no data for how "hard" people work, so we’re using time worked as the best approximation. This chart for average annual hours worked covers 1994 to 2014, and it also undercuts Trump’s statement. For this statistic, the average number of hours worked fell from 1,822 in 1995 to 1,765 in 2014, a decline of 3 percent over 20 years. And the only years in which the number of hours worked fell below the 2014 level came in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, when jobs and hours were slashed. So here too, Trump is incorrect. Trump may not have been far off All this said, it’s important not to give in to irrational exuberance about these statistics. Trump’s statement would have been more accurate if he had tweaked the timeframe. Earnings have been largely stagnant since the turn of the millennium -- a somewhat shorter time period than what he had said.. "Pretty much all the gains were in the late 1990s," said Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. "Median earnings are almost flat since 2001, so he would have been close to right if he’d said 15 years." Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that "a more reasonable statement would be that real earnings were higher in some past years than in 2015, although that doesn’t sound as damning as the wording used by Mr. Trump." Also, Trump would have been closer to accurate if he’d used a different statistic: median household income. If Trump had said instead that inflation-adjusted, median household income was lower now than it had been 15 years earlier, he would be correct — it fell by 2 percent over that span, from $57,790 to $56,516. It’s worth noting that a long-running decline in the percentage of people participating in the labor force may explain the difference in the wage data and the household income data, said Jed Kolko, chief economist with the jobs site Indeed. As more Americans move from being employed to sitting out of the labor market, these non-working Americans bring down income levels for households even as those who continue to work keep wages steady or increasing. (The retirement of Baby Boomers is one reason for the decline in the labor-force participation rate, but labor-force participation is also declining among Americans of prime working age, for unclear reasons.) Burtless added one footnote: One reason that real wages have not increased faster than they might have is that cash compensation has been falling as a percentage of total compensation. Cash compensation has fallen from 71.4 percent of workers’ total compensation in March 1995 to 68.6 percent by 2015. Because of this, Burtless said, "many labor economists would point out that total employee compensation is a better and more comprehensive indicator of workers’ pay than is the hourly wage by itself." Our ruling Trump said that "workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder." Adhering strictly to Trump’s language, he’s incorrect —median, inflation-adjusted wages are higher now than they were for 18 out of the 20 previous years, and hours worked are lower now than in any previous year except for the aftermath of the Great Recession. That said, it doesn’t take too many tweaks to Trump’s language to make the claim accurate, either by changing the statistic in question or changing the time frame. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1c8f3280-3382-4c62-a5e9-823d9636cb44	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-17T13:49:28	2016-10-13	['United_States']

pomt-05708	Says Obama has "doubled the stock market from where we started when he was sworn into office"	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/08/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-claims-stock-market-doubles-oba/	U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, as a leader in President Barack Obama’s re-election "Truth Team," wants to right verbal wrongs on the president’s record. In a Feb. 13 interview with on Richmond’s WWBT-TV with NBC12’s Ryan Nobles, Connolly, D-11th, claimed a series of successes for the president’s economic policies. One, in particular, caught our ear. "We’ve doubled the stock market from where we started when he was sworn into office -- Bush had gotten it down to 6,500. It’s double that today," Connolly said. We went to the ticker tapes to see if the stock market really has doubled since Obama’s inauguration on Jan 20, 2009. We were in deep recession then. The stock market took hits as the subprime mortgage crisis exploded. Catastrophic losses at Bear Stearns led to its sale to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008. Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that September. We looked first at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, since that’s the index Connolly alluded to in his statement. The Dow is an average of 30 large stocks in corporations such as Exxon Mobil, General Motors, Microsoft and Wal-Mart. The Dow opened at 8,279.63 on the morning Obama took the oath of office and closed at 12,874.04 on Feb. 13, 2012, when Connolly made his statement. That’s a 55.5 percent increase, not really close to the 100 percent increase Connolly claimed. So how does Connolly justify his statement? The Dow continued to plummet after Obama took office, hitting a low of 6,469.95 on March 6, 2009. It’s at this point that the Connolly camp begins measuring the stock market’s performance under Obama. The Dow increased 99 percent from that day through the day the congressman made his claim. James Walkinshaw, Connolly’s chief of staff, said the market, until that low point, was reacting to the policies of former President George W. Bush, a Republican. He said Obama’s economic plan began to take effect with the passage of the $787 billion stimulus on Feb. 13, 2009 and was not fully in force until the recovery money began flowing out that spring. Walkinshaw, in an email, also said the Nasdaq Composite Index -- which largely measures stocks of technology companies -- has doubled since Obama became president. Nasdaq opened at 1,520.76 on Inauguration Day and closed at 2,931.39 on the day Connolly made his claim. That’s a 92.8 percent increase -- almost a doubling. How much credit does Obama deserve for improvements in the stock market? Some, but not all, said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University. "There are many underlying currents in the economy and the federal government can effect their direction and flow," he said. "But the president is just one part of government. There’s Congress, regulatory agencies and the courts and they all fill this amalgam." White was skeptical about Connolly’s assertion that the decline of the market was due to Bush and the rise because of Obama. He said policies by both presidents helped lift the recession: Bush pushed through the Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008 that eased credit by allowing the U.S. Treasury to buy up to $700 billion in mortgage backed securities from financial institutions; Obama proposed the stimulus, which helped save and create jobs. "There was a set of actions started by Bush and continued by Obama that were, in my general opinion, the right actions," White said. Michael Jones, chief investment officer with Riverfront Investment Group of Richmond, linked the upswing to actions by the Federal Reserve System and not presidential policies. White said the two indexes Connolly’s office used -- the blue-chip Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq -- are not the best measures of overall stock market performance. He suggested we look at two gauges that track a broader array of companies. So we turned to Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which measures 500 stocks representing a wide swath of the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 opened at 849.64 on Inauguration Day. It closed at 1,351.77 on the day of Connolly’s statement. That’s a 59.1 percent increase. We also looked at the Wilshire 5000, which measures more than 6,500 stocks of all types. The index averaged 8,603.17 during the week on Inauguration Day and closed at 14,290.97 on the day of Connolly’s statement. That’s a 66.1 percent increase. We should note that both these indexes have doubled since early March 2009, when the stock market bottomed out. One last note: As of March 8, the stock market had not changed much since Feb. 13, when Connolly made his statement. None of the closing figures we give for that date has varied by more than 1 percent. Our ruling Connolly said the stock market has doubled since Obama "was sworn into office." Connolly based his statement on the Dow. But to make his math work, the congressman omitted a 28 percent drop in the Dow that occurred during the first seven weeks of Obama’s presidency, attributing that to the Bush administration. Connolly advantageously begins counting for Obama when the Dow, in early March 2009, sank to its lowest level in almost 12 years. We wouldn’t quibble if the congressmen had said the market has doubled during Obama’s term -- every index we examined shows it has done just that since March 2009. But Connolly’s statement demands a count from Day 1 of Obama’s administration and when start there, a different picture emerges. The Dow rose 55.5 percent from Inauguration Day to the day of Connolly’s statement. Two broad indexes tell a similar story: the S&P 500 went up 59.1 percent and the Wilshire 5000 increased by 66.1 percent. It’s debatable how much of the improvement can be pinpointed to the president’s policies. So Connolly’s claim has a foundation that is cracked by the weight of exaggeration and cherry-picked data.

pomt-01610	Greg Abbott was "charged with overseeing the state cancer research fund. But he let his wealthiest donors take tens of millions of taxpayer dollars without proper oversight. They showered Abbott with gifts and free vacations."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/31/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-greg-abbott-let-millions-taxpayer/	In a TV ad unveiled Aug. 23, 2014, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis suggested sinister ties between her Republican opponent and a scandal-tinged Texas agency that funds cancer research. In the spot, a Fort Worth man identified as cancer survivor Manuel Alvarado says: "When you’re battling cancer, you pray for a cure. But Greg Abbott did his best to keep my prayers from being answered." Abbott, Alvarado says, "was charged with overseeing the state cancer research fund. But he let his wealthiest donors take tens of millions of taxpayer dollars without proper oversight. They showered Abbott with gifts and free vacations and and they made off with money that was meant to find a cure." Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, has previously sought to implicate Abbott, the state attorney general, in the scandal that two years ago engulfed the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. In May 2014, according to an Austin American-Statesman news story, she maintained that Abbott campaign donors also were investors in companies that received improperly-vetted institute grants. Jerry Strickland, Abbott’s state spokesman, countered that the attorney general’s office had been involved in an investigation leading to the 2013 Travis County indictment of Gerald "Jerry" Cobbs, a former institute executive involved in awarding an $11 million grant to Peloton Therapeutics even though the biotech startup had not gone through the necessary outside scientific review. Cobbs awaits trial. So, was Abbott charged with overseeing the anti-cancer fund? Did he let campaign donors take tens of millions in taxpayer dollars? And did the donors shower him with gifts and vacations? Abbott and the anti-cancer institute Per the 2007 law setting up the institute, its governing body, or oversight committee, consisted of nine appointed members plus the attorney general or the attorney general’s designee and the state comptroller or the comptroller’s designee. Starting in 2009, that committee had the unprecedented job of awarding millions of dollars to cancer-related projects after Texas voters approved the issuance of $3 billion in bonds over 10 years "to fund groundbreaking cancer research and prevention programs and services in Texas," the institute says on its website. The 2013 Legislature, reacting to red flags including grants being bestowed despite scientific misgivings, shrank the oversight committee. Its nine members would continue to be appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and Texas House speaker, but the revised law lifted the mandate that the attorney general and state comptroller or respective designees serve, according to a July 2013 Senate Research Center summary of the changes. Also new: Anyone named to the panel must disclose to the institute each political contribution to a candidate for a state or federal office over $1,000 made by the person in the five years preceding the person's appointment and each year after the person's appointment until the person's term expired, with the institute posting a summary each year, the center wrote. To our inquiry, a Davis spokesman, Zac Petkanas, said the Democrat’s August ad was based on news stories and editorials. Among the stories, a May 11, 2013, account in the Dallas Morning News said Abbott hadn’t attended any of the board’s 23 meetings to that date. By email, Strickland told us Abbott never cast a committee vote on a "grant, nor was he involved in any grant request, review or award." The News story quoted Abbott saying that picking a high-ranking state assistant to take his place "allowed me to retain the independence to take action to respond to any broader challenges posed by CPRIT." Strickland told us Abbott’s designee on the committee, James "Jay" Dyer, voted like other board members at meetings he attended though he also was unaware of issues surrounding grants that came into question because they were due to "misconduct, mismanagement and disclosure failures" by the institute’s senior staff, Strickland said. In December 2012, the attorney general’s office announced it was looking into institute operations. Strickland told us a forensics unit in the office helped Travis County’s investigation by recovering deleted emails and data files that institute staff claimed had been lost. "Because the matter investigated by this office in conjunction with the Public Integrity Unit is currently the subject of an ongoing prosecution," Strickland said, "our investigation is not closed and we cannot comment further on this matter." In January 2013, after Travis County began the inquiry that led to the institute executive’s indictment, the county's district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, said committee members (presumably including Abbott) "are not under suspicion in the investigation," the Statesman said in a news story at the time. But Lehmberg did not clear the whole institute, saying "we are far from finished in our efforts." By that day, the story said, three top executives had resigned and left the cancer-fighting agency. The institute and Abbott donors News stories cited by Davis have pointed out major donors to Republican candidates with connections to entities that received institute awards, though we saw no stories indicating millions of dollars went directly to Abbott donors. According to the 2013 News’ story, on June 18, 2010, the institute oversight committee ratified the $11 million award to Peloton Therapeutics, described as using laboratory discoveries at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to try to develop anti-cancer drugs. That grant was given without the required business or scientific review, the story said, and with Abbott’s designee absent from the meeting. The News reported that three committee members who ratified the award to Peloton had contributed $150,000 since 2002 to Abbott’s campaigns. Among them: Charles Tate, a Houston investor who had ponied up $140,000 to Abbott’s campaigns, the paper said. Of that, the story said, Tate contributed $100,000 in November 2012, which would have been about three weeks before Abbott’s office announced its institute probe. The newspaper said at least one Peloton investor also had Abbott ties. Dallas philanthropist Peter O’Donnell, one of Peloton’s financial backers, had contributed $130,000 to Abbott’s campaigns since 2001, the story said. O’Donnell earlier said he invested in Peloton in July 2011, more than a year after the oversight committee ratified the award, the paper reported. O’Donnell was connected to another spotlighted institute grant. In January 2013, the Texas state auditor, John Keel, issued an audit raising questions about the agency's biggest grant, $25.2 million awarded in June 2010 to the Statewide Clinical Trials Network of Texas, CTNeT, which was created to speed clinical trials of cancer drugs, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. The Chronicle said the grant's "receiving agent" was Carolyn Bacon Dickson, executive director of the O'Donnell Foundation, tied to Peter O'Donnell. Keel said in the audit that like the grant to Peloton, the award to CTNeT was bestowed despite the absence of a favorable recommendation by peer scientists. Around the time of the state audit, CTNeT ceased operations after the institute cut off its funding, according to a Jan. 29, 2013, Statesman news story. The Davis campaign suggested another nefarious -- though indirect -- connection to the CTNeT grant. Steve Hicks of Austin, who has donated $193,000 to Abbott’s campaigns, according to a March 1, 2014, news story in the San Antonio Express-News, is executive chairman of Capstar Partners, an investment firm where a partner, John Cullen, was described in a July 2011 institute foundation report as a member of CTNeT’s board of directors. (Our check of state records showed Cullen, identified as manager of Mood Media Consulting, gave $1,000 to Abbott’s kitty Sept. 26, 2013.) Petkanas mentioned another Abbott backer with an institute connection. A July 27, 2013, Chronicle news story said San Antonio businessman James Leininger, described as donating $289,000 to Abbott’s campaigns since 2001, had a biotechnology company, Caliber Biotherapuetics, that received $12 million from the institute to carry out a proposal despite receiving low scores from reviewers. According to a Nov. 2, 2011, publication on the institute’s website, the institute approved a $12.8 million grant for the company, based in Bryan-College Station, to tap hydroponic plants to devise a better antibody therapy against two types of cancer. Caliber Biotherapeutics isn’t Leininger’s company. But it lists as its sole institutional investor Medcare Investment Funds, which on its website lists Leininger as its founder. When we called Nashville-based Medcare, the person who answered the phone said Leininger continues to be involved, though she declined to elaborate or to be identified before referring us to a San Antonio telephone number where our request for detail didn’t generate information. To our telephone and email inquiries, Caliber Biotherapeutics and Leininger each offered no comment. Shower of gifts, vacations? By email, Petkanas initially told us Leininger was the campaign’s example of gifts and travel showered on Abbott by donors with a stake in entities that drew grants from the institute. The 2014 Express-News story said Leininger had paid for Abbott and his family’s travel and accommodations three times between 2008 and 2010, according to Abbott’s state-filed personal financial statements. Every state official must report any gift worth more than $250. We confirmed the described Leininger-funded trips (one each in 2008, 2009 and 2010) from Abbott’s filings; none of the entries called the listed trip a vacation while Abbott’s camp didn’t immediately reply when we asked if the gifted trips were vacations. Hicks -- the investor whose firm’s partner, Cullen, was a CTNeT board member -- joined with his wife, Donna, in giving Abbott a travel guide membership in 2009, Abbott reported. Our ruling Davis said Abbott was "charged with overseeing the state cancer research fund. But he let his wealthiest donors take tens of millions of taxpayer dollars without proper oversight. They showered Abbott with gifts and free vacations." There’s something here, but Davis leaves out substantive details. Abbott was on a big committee created to oversee institute awards though he designated an aide to act in his stead, not once attending. Also unsaid is that Abbott’s office helped Travis County’s investigation leading to an institute staff member’s indictment; the local district attorney also said committee members weren’t suspected of wrongdoing. A major Abbott donor gave three trips, valued at more than $250 each, to Abbott’s family, but contrary to the ad’s message, that isn’t the same as all the campaign donors connected to institute grants showering Abbott with gifts and free vacations.

pomt-10077	"Even with recent changes, the average hourly wage at General Motors is still $75 an hour."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/13/spencer-bachus/big-three-wages-inflated/	In the debate over the bailout of the American auto industry, one number seemed to stick in the craw of a reluctant public: the oft-quoted figure that manufacturing workers at America's Big Three automakers — Ford, Chrysler and General Motors — make $75 an hour; some $30 more than nonunion workers at so-called "transplant" auto companies, like the U.S. plants of Honda and Toyota. "My initial problem justifying these loans to the Big Three is when I speak to my constituents, and it is a fairness issue," said U.S. Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., a ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee during a hearing on the auto industry in November. "The vast majority of my constituents are not making anywhere near what General Motors, Chrysler and Ford pay their employees." "Even with recent changes, the average hourly wage at General Motors is still $75 an hour," Bachus said. "That's 50 percent, 100 percent or, in some cases, three or four times what my constituents are making. "My constituents do not understand why their taxpayer dollars should go to support what they consider less efficient businesses." Who could resist doing the math? Let's see ... $75 an hour, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks in a year ... $156,000 a year! And they want a taxpayer bailout? Except the number isn't right. In the case of GM (cited by Bachus), the wage for a traditional line worker is actually $29.49 an hour, according to GM spokesman Tony Sapienza. That comes to an annual salary of around $61,300. Comfortable, sure, but a far cry from $156,000. According to Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, which tracks these things, the typical hourly wage for union employees at the Big Three is about $28 an hour. Wages at the nonunion transplant companies range from $14.60 to $28 an hour, she said. Wages vary even among different plants of the same companies, depending on regional wage standards. For example, Toyota pays $27 to $30 an hour at its plant in Kentucky, but just $20 an hour at a Mississippi plant. "You can't just say that a transplant wage is this and that the Detroit Big Three is that," Dziczek said. Let's factor in benefits. According to Dziczek, in addition to making about $28 an hour, Big Three autoworkers gets benefits worth about $23. Add in overtime, vacation pay shift bonuses, health insurance, pension payments and other compensation, and it comes to about $62 an hour in labor cost per active employee. The cost for wages and benefits at transplant companies is about $40 to $55 an hour. "They're not terribly far off," Dziczek said. But Bachus and other congressmen who have cited similar hourly numbers didn't just pluck them out of thin air. What they are citing is an "all-in" labor cost for hourly wage employees. That "all-in" cost includes all pay and benefits to current employees. But here's the kicker: It also includes health benefits paid to retired workers. Consider this: At the end of 2007, GM had 365,000 retired hourly employees, as opposed to 62,000 active hourly employees. "We are a 100-year-old company," said Sapienza. "We have significant obligations to retirees. We have stuck by our commitment. It does pose a competitive disadvantage." Among all the Big Three, Dziczek said, there are four retirees for every current worker. Paying health benefits to those workers is a huge obligation that the transplant companies just don't have, as they just haven't been around long enough to have that many retirees. All of the transplants have many more workers than retirees, she said. So while the cost of retiree benefits is not part of the compensation for active employees, it is a labor cost borne by the automakers. And so auto companies calculate the entire expense of hourly employees — including retirees — and then divide that whole sum by the number of current employees. For GM, that comes to $69 an hour, according to Sapienza. Other figures from the Big Three have put that figure just north of $70 an hour. That's where Bachus got his number. There's one other major factor to consider. In 2007, the United Auto Workers union — which represents laborers at the Big Three — negotiated a historic deal that calls for a new voluntary employee benefit association that will allow the Big Three to contribute a one-time cost and subsequently allow the unions to run the health care benefits program of retired autoworkers. That will allow the companies to wipe out their health care obligations to retirees. In addition, the unions agreed to a two-tiered pay system such that new (second-tier) hires will start at about $14 an hour. According to a Ford analysis presented to Congress, when the ratio of new, second-tier workers reaches about 20 percent of the overall work force, the difference between hourly labor costs at the Big Three and the transplant auto companies will nearly disappear. Still, this much is true in the arguments posed by Bachus: Autoworkers generally make more than other manufacturing workers. According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (November 2008), the average hourly earnings (wage only) for automobile production workers was $30.27 compared to $17.91 for all manufacturing production workers. Auto workers are the kings of the industrial labor force, Dziczek said, and that surely breeds some resentment — particularly when it comes to talking about a taxpayer-funded bailout. That might be a legitimate point to make, but when Bachus and others cited a figure suggesting Big Three autoworkers make more than $70 an hour, it is not only misleading, it's just wrong. That figure is a labor cost that includes the expense of health benefits for retirees. We rate the statement False.

pomt-08522	Says Lee Fisher "wanted a $1.1 billion tax increase which could have driven countless jobs out of state."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/05/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-attacks-lee-fisher-support-11-/	If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Ohio Democrats can feel positively fawned upon by American Crossroads, the deep-pocketed conservative political action group conceived by Karl Rove and former Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie. A TV ad the group is running against Democratic Senate candidate Lee Fisher, in support of Republican Rob Portman, is almost a frame-by-frame copy of a spot run by Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008. The Obama spot, "Rearview Mirror," opened with the shot of a highway and man inside a car adjusting the mirror. The voiceover said, "Wonder where John McCain would take the economy? Look behind you." The ad cut to a shot of George Bush in the mirror, followed by a series of blue and green signs, roadside and overhead, spelling out the ad's talking points. It closed with a shot of McCain and Bush in the mirror. The American Crossroads spot, "Behind," opens with the shot of a highway and a man inside a car adjusting the mirror. The voiceover says, "Where will Lee Fisher take our economy? Just look behind you." It cuts to a shot of Fisher in the mirror, followed by a series of blue and green signs, roadside and overhead, spelling out the ad's talking points. It closes with a shot of Fisher in the mirror. But imitation is also the sincerest form of television, and ads don't necessarily win or lose points for originality. Our concern is content, and the ad's three points also display a taste for recycling. First is the statement, "Fisher served as Gov. Strickland's top official on job creation, yet Ohio has lost almost 400,000 jobs." PolitiFact examined this claim earlier, and rated it Half True. Fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to Ohio, but that doesn’t mean he is solely responsible for the job losses. And the state didn’t lose that many jobs while he was head of the Department of Development. The spot also asserts that Fisher "even supported Obama's stimulus that failed to create jobs." The critical point is the contention that the stimulus failed to create jobs, another claim that PolitiFact has examined and found untrue and, in one case, rated as Pants on Fire. Wedged between those claims in the Crossroads ad is the assertion that Fisher "wanted a $1.1 billion tax increase which could have driven countless jobs out of state." That charge is new to this campaign, and the claim that PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at. But it’s such a blast from the past that you need the Hubble Space Telescope to see it, not a rearview mirror. Asked for sources, American Crossroads said the charge is based on Fisher's support for a plan proposed in 1997 to raise the state sales tax from 5 cents on the dollar to 6 cents. The so-called plan was a state ballot issue proposed by then-Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican, who was leaving office to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by John Glenn. Both candidates to replace Voinovich -- Fisher, the Democrat, and Secretary of State Bob Taft, the Republican -- voiced support for the ballot issue. Fisher also vowed that as governor he would not seek any increase in state sales or income taxes without voter consent. The 1-cent sales tax was intended to generate $1.1 billion a year -- $550 million for schools and $550 million for homeowner property-tax relief. Voters rejected it at the polls in May 1998. But the way it is used in the ad is misleading: The ad gives no indication that the issue is 12 years old. Raising it between a reference to Fisher’s term as state development director, 2007 to 2009, and a claim about the stimulus, passed in 2009, creates the impression that the issue is current or recent. There is no hint that the plan was an attempt to deal with school funding and that it had bipartisan support. It is true that Fisher, as well as leading Republicans in Ohio at the time, supported the sales tax issue that would have raised $1.1 billion. That’s one element of accuracy. But the ad leaves out important details needed to fully present the statement in proper context. We rate it Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-09284	"We researched to find out if anybody on Fox News had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance. Nobody's ever said it."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/27/bill-oreilly/oreilly-says-no-one-fox-raised-issue-jail-time-not/	Sen. Tom Coburn -- a staunchly conservative Oklahoma Republican -- surprised many on the right and the left in early April when he urged a town hall audience back home not to take everything said on Fox News as gospel. The spark for this unexpected exhortation was a question from an audience member about whether Americans could go to prison for failure to pay a penalty for not securing health insurance. "The intention is not to put anyone in jail," Coburn told the audience. "That makes for good TV news on Fox, but that isn’t the intention." One of Fox's best-known hosts, Bill O'Reilly, took note of this apostasy and invited Coburn to join him as a guest on his April 13, 2010, show. After some back-and-forth, Coburn told O'Reilly that he's "very glad" that Fox News is doing what it does. "You offer a balance to the total slant on the left," Coburn said. "But when we're not accurate, or when we overstate the case, and I will tell you I have heard that in certain Fox programs, the case is overstated." O'Reilly shot back, "But tell me what -- because it doesn't happen here. And we researched to find out if anybody on Fox News had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance. Nobody's ever said it. So it seems to me that what you did was you used Fox News as a whipping boy when we didn't qualify there." We thought we'd check O'Reilly's claim that no one on Fox News "had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance." But first some background about what Coburn was referring to in the first place. One of the key principles of the recently passed health care law is to corral uninsured Americans who can afford health care insurance into getting coverage. Except for a few exempted categories -- people for whom insurance premiums would be a financial hardship, Americans with religious objections, American Indians, undocumented immigrants and prison inmates -- Americans are all supposed to enroll in a health care plan. If they do not, the law imposes penalty fees that are administered through the tax code. Critics of the bill have seized on this "individual mandate" as contrary to individual liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. In fact, the provision forms the basis of a lawsuit filed by a group of predominantly Republican attorneys general that challenges the newly enacted law. But what has bothered some critics even more than the penalties themselves is the fear that a failure to pay those penalties could land a violator in prison. Neither the initial health care bill introduced in the House (H.R. 3200) nor the one that passed the House in November 2009 (H.R. 3962) had specific language ruling out prison for those who failed to pay penalties for not having health insurance. However, many experts considered the likelihood of prison time remote. On Sept. 29, 2009 -- at a time when H.R. 3200 was the only detailed health care bill under consideration in either chamber -- PolitiFact concluded that "the notion that one could go to prison for not buying insurance is certainly attention-grabbing, but based on past patterns of prosecution, the likelihood of it happening is extremely small." Even that slight chance disappeared after the Senate got involved. The outline of a bill introduced on Sept. 16, 2009, by Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., didn't specify how penalties would be enforced but by the time the measure had made it into official language and been passed by his committee on Oct. 19, 2009, it included the following provision: "In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by this section, such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure." That provision made it into the bill passed by the Senate in December 2009, and also into the final version of the law that was passed by both chambers and signed by President Barack Obama. Now let's analyze O'Reilly's specific statement. It turns out that several Fox shows did mention the possibility of jail time. Here are some examples: • Paul Gigot, host of the Journal Editorial Reports, Oct. 3, 2009 "Democrats want to require you to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. But they don't want you to call it a tax. Under the Baucus bill, the so-called individual mandate would require everyone to buy health insurance or pay as much as a $1,900 fee. If you don't pay up, the IRS could punish you with a $25,000 fine or a year in jail." • Sean Hannity, interviewing Greg Mueller, the president of CRC Public Relations, and Penny Lee, a Democratic strategist, on Nov. 10, 2009 Hannity: "Jail? Is that..." Mueller: "We are losing freedom. The Berlin Wall anniversary is just the other day. And these are the kind of policies that used to be imposed on people behind that wall. One problem we're going to have, though, Sean, they're going to have, though, Sean, they're going to have to do something about prisons. They're going to put all these people in jail. It costs $50,000 a year to take care of a prisoner. So they're going to have to do prison reform." Hannity: "That's going to be true." Mueller: "Democrats don't like to do prisons." Hannity: "Put people in jail if they don't get their government mandated health? We're going to tax business. We're going to tax individuals. There's going to be fines. There's going to be penalties. There's a millionaire's tax. We're paying for it through the wall. This is what you want? Your socialist utopia, Penny." Lee: "You're not in socialist utopia. What they're trying to do is bring competitive choice and bring affordable quality health care." Hannity: "People in jail?" • Andrew Napolitano, guest-hosting the Glenn Beck Program, Nov. 10, 2009 "For the first time in American history, if this bill becomes law, the feds will force you to buy insurance you might not want or may not need or cannot afford. If you don't purchase what the government tells you to buy, if you don't do so when they tell you to do it, if you don't buy just what they say is right for you, the government may fine you, prosecute you, and even put you in jail." • Glenn Beck, on his Fox show, Nov. 12, 2009 "But if you don't play by their new rules on health care -- oh, here's a new little twist. Have you heard this? You're going to be looking at a fun little stint in jail." Later in the show, Beck said, "And oh, yes, the potential jail time. If you don't have health insurance? Jail time. You heard Nancy Pelosi defend that portion of the bill just a few minutes ago. There has got to be some way to force everybody to have health care, right? It is jail." So we found at least four cases in which hosts or guests brought up the possibility of people being jailed for not having health insurance. Given the amount of programming hours that Fox aired during the health care debate, that's not an overwhelming number of mentions, and if O'Reilly had simply said that Fox didn't beat the drum too loudly on that specific provision, we'd be tempted to give him a pass. But he not only said definitively that "nobody's ever said it" on the network, but also said that his staff had researched the question. So we are left to conclude that either his staff muffed its research or that O'Reilly trying to pull a fast one. One would think the story ends there, but it doesn't. On April 15, 2010, two days after his initial claim, O'Reilly managed to dig himself deeper. Faced with evidence from the liberal group Media Matters that jail time had indeed been discussed on Fox, O'Reilly sought to clarify what he meant the first time around. "Now as we all know, the prison option was taken off the table when the final Obama care bill was being debated," O'Reilly said. "And that's what we were talking to Sen. Coburn about, the final bill debate. Not all that stuff. So, what I said is absolutely true. Nobody at Fox News reported inaccurately about the Obamacare prison situation. Nobody. Yet, Media Matters, as they always do, distorted the entire situation. Shamefully, NBC News and Time magazine lapped up the garbage and put it right out there." The way we see it, O'Reilly is rewriting history. We see no evidence in his initial statement that he was referring to Fox's references to jail time only during a specific time period. And he subtly tried to bolster his case by the clips he chose to accompany his April 15 comment. He used two clips to illustrate how Fox had dealt with the question of jail time in the past, both of which consisted of footage of journalists from other networks asking Obama and Pelosi a jail-related question at legitimate news events. Using those clips made it seem to viewers like Fox was getting blasted from the left simply for reporting on genuine news events, when in fact the criticism had to do instead with comments by Beck, Hannity and other hosts and guests who used the Fox platform to attack the health care bill. O'Reilly said nobody had "ever" said on Fox that you risked jail if you don't buy health insurance, and to us, "ever" means "ever." So we don't buy O'Reilly's after-the-fact defense.

pomt-02769	"We are experiencing the worst economic recovery America has ever had."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/11/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-current-economic-recovery-wo/	On Page 1 of his new book, Gov. Scott Walker makes the case that Wisconsin residents are facing some tough times. The first-term Republican governor declares the "view from Washington D.C. these days is pretty grim" and cites the re-election of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, tax increases, the national debt and the economy as a whole: "We are experiencing the worst economic recovery America has ever had," Walker writes. That’s a strong statement. After all, the claim encompases more than 10 recessions and recoveries, including the post-Sept. 11 decline, the 1980 double dip recession, and, of course, the Great Depression. So is the state of affairs today really the worst of times? The publicist for Walker’s book didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. So, we’ll start with what Walker listed as his evidence. The footnotes cite an Aug. 3, 2012 entry on the Washington Post’s "The Fix" politics blog. The blog item discusses political ads by Republicans that use a snippet from a July 17, 2012 CBS newscast in which anchor Scott Pelley says: "This is the worst economic recovery America has ever seen." The short snippet contains no statistical backup to Pelley’s assertion, which was part of the introduction to a report about unemployment. What’s more, the blog entry doesn’t exactly give the claim a ringing endorsement. It notes that other claims have been made regarding the recovery -- it’s the slowest in memory, second slowest since World War II, and that the jobs recovery is the slowest since the Depression. Then it notes: "Most media outlets aren’t describing the recovery as the slowest ever. In other words, there’s not yet a consensus on this. So what Pelley was saying is news to plenty of people." So the footnote Walker cited actually undermines his claim instead of supporting it. Another look So, how does the recovery from the Great Recession stack up? The recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is the official arbiter of such things. It is agreed that it was the nation’s worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. As for the recovery, Walker didn’t describe how he was measuring a recovery, but experts say there are numerous tools you can use to do so. Two of the most frequently used are employment and economic output. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website even has a tool that allows comparisons of the 10 recessions and recoveries since 1948 using those indicators. (The tool doesn’t extend back to the Depression because official government data gathering by the Bureau of Labor Statistics didn’t take place that far back.) "This page provides a current assessment of 'how bad' the 2007-2009 recession was relative to past recessions, and of how quickly the economy is recovering relative to past recoveries," the Fed explains on its site. Here’s what the Fed’s site says: Employment: This recovery is not the worst when it comes to jobs. The employment recovery after the 1980 recession was particularly difficult. Then, the recovery sputtered and the economy slid into that "double dip" recession. Employment took 36 months to move to positive territory. During the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment didn’t crawl out of negative territory for about 28 months. By comparison, in the recovery from the 2007 recession, employment returned to positive territory after 20 months. Economic output: This recovery is the slowest since the Depression when it comes to economic output. After 17 months, the gross domestic product had increased 9.98 percent in the recent recovery. The recovery in output after the 1980 recession took place at a quicker pace, but after a far slower start. That recovery saw little growth in output between months five and 10, compared with slow but steady increases in the months following the start of the 2007 recovery. Put another way: the recovery from the 2007 recession took longer, but the country’s output was better than the 1980 recovery for a significant stretch. So, using the Fed’s calculator, Walker is wrong on employment and right on economic output -- but this does not account for the Great Depression. How does the Depression compare? Comparing the current recovery with recovery from the Depression is a little more difficult, said Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, senior vice president and director of research for the Minneapolis Fed. In the four years following the end of the Depression in 1933, gross domestic product shot up 43 percent, he said. That compares with 7 percent from 2009 and 2012, the most recent year for which data is available. But that’s not a clean comparison, in part because Depression was so severe. "In the Depression, GDP dropped so much that it couldn’t help but go up a lot" during the recovery, said Schulhofer-Wohl, noting that he was speaking for himself and not the bank. Wells Fargo economist Brian Jacobsen offered a similar perspective. "The first year out of the Great Depression had a GDP growth rate of 11 percent while the growth from 2009 to 2010 was a mere 2.7 percent," he said. Jacobsen said the economic decline in the Depression was much more severe than in the most recent recession. "From 2007 to 2009, GDP dropped 3 percent while from 1929 to 1933, GDP dropped 27 percent," he said. "If you had to pick this anemic recovery or the recovery from the Great Depression, and you had to take their respective downturns, I'd take this recovery any day." Employment-wise the Depression was worse than any other downturn. Unemployment peaked at 24.9 percent in 1933, according to one measure. Six years later, it was still at 17.2 percent, a far slower jobs recovery than what we’re now seeing. And, there were economic upheavals that took place before the Depression. "There were also terrible economic recoveries in the 1800s," Jacobsen said. "In terms of recoveries, from 2009 to 2012, real per capita GDP grew about 6.1 percent. The recovery in 1834, 1840, 1865, and 1893 were all much worse," Jacobsen said citing data from the Maddison Project, a global database of historical growth. Walker is not the first politician to take aim at the slow recovery. PolitiFact has looked at versions of the too-slow recovery claim, although no statement has been as broad as Walker’s. In June 2011, PolitiFact reviewed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney who said "This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover." That statement was rated False, because at that point of the recovery -- 23 months out -- there were two recoveries weaker in terms of employment than the current one, and three recoveries that saw an increase in the unemployment rate at that stage. The New York Times studied the length of the recovery in an economic blog in August 2012. The Times took 10 metrics and compared the current recovery to all others since the Great Depression. In one category -- corporate profits -- the current recovery was better than the average of all of the other recoveries. In short, it’s not the worst. "On almost every measure I looked at, there was at least one previous (completed) recovery that performed worse," Catherine Rampell wrote in the Times. Our rating In the opening passage of his new book, Walker cites the slow pace of the economic recovery as one of the woes facing Wisconsin. He says it’s the worst economic recovery the U.S. has ever had. But the jobs recovery was slower in other recessions, including the Great Depression. Economic output is a little less cut and dried because the Depression was so severe that the bounce back was more pronounced. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05286	Says Paul Workman authored legislation providing amnesty for illegal immigrants.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/may/24/ryan-downton/ryan-downton-says-paul-workman-offered-legislation/	Ryan Downton of Austin, challenging Austin state Rep. Paul Workman in the 2012 Republican primary, maintains that Workman last year proposed Texas-style amnesty for illegal immigrants. In a May 21, 2012, open letter posted on his campaign website, Downton -- who earlier urged us to look at this issue -- says Workman, who seeks a second two-year term, has deliberately not told voters about the proposal. "In short, he wants to pretend the bill doesn’t exist," Downton writes. "I can understand why he doesn't want you to know about" House Bill 2886 "because it... provides amnesty to illegal immigrants... provides driver's licenses to illegal immigrants... forbids employers from discrimination against illegal immigrants; and would make Texas a ‘sanctuary state’ where law enforcement personnel couldn't enforce federal immigration law." That covers a lot of turf. In this article, we’ll gauge Downton’s main claim that Workman’s proposal provided amnesty, which in connection with immigration can be a politically radioactive term. As PolitiFact in Washington noted in a December 2, 2011, article, Merriam Webster defines amnesty as "the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals." With respect to illegal immigrants, the historical standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. That law enabled illegal residents to become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in the United States by Jan. 1, 1982, and met other minimal requirements. It was widely described as an "amnesty" program. Then again, the definition of amnesty can vary based on one’s attitude toward immigration policies. Advocates for more legal immigration often maintain that amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Those who oppose more immigration define amnesty more broadly. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, previously told PolitiFact: "Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty." By email and in a telephone interview, Downton said that Workman’s proposal would have forgiven foreign nationals in the United States illegally who qualified for state-issued cards permitting them to work in Texas. Also, he said, the Workman proposal included elements mirroring provisions in the 1986 federal immigration act. Downton said by email: "While it is not complete amnesty, because Texas does not have the power to invalidate federal immigration law, it is as much amnesty as the state of Texas can provide." We were ready to read the legislation, which the Austin American-Statesman referred to as a "guest worker" plan in a March 10, 2011, news article on Workman filing the proposal that day. According to legislative records, the measure was initially referred to the House Committee on State Affairs, which held an April 6, 2011, hearing on it. Titled the Texas Immigrant Reconciliation Act, the proposal calls for providing a way to gather information on foreign nationals illegally in the state and to collect taxes to pay for services provided to such residents. The proposal also says it provides a "legal method for a foreign national to work in this state; ensure that employers hire only legally eligible workers; and remove the incentive for human trafficking along the southern border." Under the proposal, undocumented immigrants could apply to the Texas Workforce Commission for a "Texas resident alien card" by paying $4,000 and submitting to a criminal history check. The card, valid for eight years, would enable the holder to work legally in the state; holders could subsequently apply for a new card. The proposal also says the holder of a resident alien card is eligible for a driver’s license. Funding would come from a requirement that employers of illegal residents withhold from their paychecks a state tax at the rate of federal withholding. The legislation says U.S. citizenship is not contemplated: "An unlawful resident alien does not become a United States citizen because the person has been issued a resident alien card. A resident alien card does not create an advantage to the cardholder in obtaining citizenship." An employer hiring card-carrying immigrants would have an "affirmative defense against any charge by the federal government for hiring an unlawful resident alien," the proposal says. In contrast, the measure says, an employer of a foreign national not lawfully present in Texas and not issued the state resident alien card is subject to a $10,000 fine for each incident. Other provisions bar illegal immigrants from state-provided public health services, save emergency hospital care, as well as federal Social Security benefits. But, the proposal says, an employer must provide benefits to a card holder similar to benefits the employer provides to employees considered legal residents under federal law. So, Workman authored a proposal making it possible for illegal immigrants to work legally in Texas for eight years at a clip. Next, we listened to the House hearing on the proposal. Addressing the committee, Workman suggested the federal government had failed to enforce immigration laws and it was time for Texas to attempt his reform. "Now those who believe that deportation is the only solution and see no middle ground will not be happy with this legislation," Workman said. "But if I may quote an old passage of Scripture, ‘Come now and let us reason together.’" Workman also said it would be impractical to deport an estimated 12 million illegal U.S. residents or some 1.5 million believed to be in Texas. "Mass deportation will not happen," he said. Workman did not refer to his proposal as amnesty; two opponents did. "This is basically an amnesty bill for eight years," testified TJ Scott. David Carter, a member of the Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas, which urges close attention to illegal immigration, said: "It’s amnesty for a fee; it’s amnesty, amnesty, amnesty." Workman, closing his presentation, said: "I knew when I filed this bill it would be controversial. But I think that the state of Texas needs to engage in the debate about what do with the folks that are here in Texas illegally and contributing to our economy -- some would say taking away from our economy." The representative also said: "What you heard over and over again is that we need to secure our border and enforce immigration laws, and that’s exactly what’s not happening. And in anybody’s estimation, it’s not going to happen." The committee left the proposal pending; there was no further action before the legislative session ended. Workman's campaign, responding to our inquiry about Downton's claim, emailed a statement from Workman declaring his opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants. His statement says his proposal had nothing to do with citizenship, a federal issue, and provided for fining employers who knowingly break the law by hiring illegal immigrants. "The legislation was aimed at providing the state of Texas with an avenue to find out who is here illegally, if they have a criminal record and find out if they are paying taxes," Workman said. "Monies paid by the illegal immigrants under the bill were to be used to enhance border security and help pay for social services illegal immigrants are now, otherwise, getting for free." Our ruling Under Workman’s 2011 proposal, illegal residents paying a fee and clearing a background check could receive a state-issued card enabling them to work in Texas for eight years at a time. That strikes us as a kind of forgiveness some would consider amnesty. However, the proposal does not go as far as the 1986 federal act, which enabled immigrants to become legal residents for all purposes, not just to work for a time period in one state. Significantly, that law put beneficiaries on paths to citizenship; Workman’s proposal would not. We rate Downton’s statement Half True.

pomt-09517	Says state Sen. Steve Ogden was the "driving force behind business income tax hurting small business, crafted the Robin Hood school finance scheme making property taxes skyrocket, wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit and voted against" gun freedoms.	false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/16/ben-bius/ben-bius-says-sen-ogden-was-force-behind-hurtful-b/	Huntsville businessman Ben Bius, challenging state Sen. Steve Ogden of Bryan in the March 2 Republican primary, doesn’t think much of Ogden’s performance. In a Bius radio ad that aired recently on Austin’s KLBJ-AM, a narrator suggests Ogden, who chairs the pivotal Senate Finance Committee, is an out-of-control tax-and-spender. The narrator says: "Steve Ogden was the driving force behind a new business income tax that hurt small business. He crafted the Robin Hood school finance scheme that made our property taxes skyrocket. And Steve Ogden wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit for Texas … Ogden even voted against our Second Amendment freedoms on right-to-carry legislation." The spot could make listeners wonder how Ogden got elected in his conservative district. But is it correct? Bius, referring us to research footnoted on his campaign Web site, told us: "We stick strictly to the facts. It’s exactly the truth." Let's look at the facts behind Bius’s first claim, which refers to Ogden's role in 2006 as Republican lawmakers scrambled to finance the cost of reductions in school property tax rates. That year, Ogden was the Senate sponsor of a House-initiated plan replacing the corporate franchise tax with a tax based on gross receipts, part of a package backed by GOP leaders including Gov. Rick Perry. Bius says in his ad that the tax hurt small businesses. He pointed us to a Dallas Morning News article published last year quoting Laura Stromberg of the National Federation of Independent Business: "Small businesses operate on smaller profit margins. By taxing them on their gross receipts, small businesses are unfairly hit." Stromberg reaffirmed the criticism when we reached her, noting the federation continues to favor repeal. The revamped tax did draw in some small businesses that hadn't been subject to such a tax previously. However, early last year the state released its first study of the tax, which found that while it had shifted the tax burden between some business sectors, overall it wasn’t hitting small businesses unfairly. Franchise "tax liability increased for all sizes of taxpayers except the very smallest," State Comptroller Susan Combs said, and the tax "now reflects the economy more closely than it did before... At the same time, the change in the base and the inclusion of newly taxable entities shifted the relative burden of the tax to firms at the middle of the size spectrum, while the share of tax paid by the very largest and smallest of taxpayers declined." Last year, legislators including Ogden raised the annual business income threshold for being subject to the tax from $300.000 to $1 million, a move described as eliminating the burden on smaller businesses. Ogden, defending the tax, said: "We changed the business tax to make it fairer and more broad-based," Ogden said. "The increased revenue was used to help pay for the $14 billion cut in school property taxes--and small businesses pay a lot of property taxes. So it didn’t hurt them." Bius's Web site doesn't list evidence for his second claim, that Ogden crafted the school finance scheme which Bius says drove up property taxes. But here's the background: In 1993, fearing court intervention to equalize funding among the state's public schools, lawmakers created the so-called Robin Hood approach. It requires school districts that are home to vast property wealth to share resources with less fortunate districts. Ogden was among a few House members listed as co-sponsors, and was the the sole Republican named to the House-Senate conference panel that finalized the finance plan. But the legislation was initiated by Sen. Bill Ratliff, who chaired the Senate Education Committee. Ratliff and former Rep. Paul Sadler, who served on the conference committee, each told us that Ogden did not craft the plan. And two longtime analysts, school finance expert Dan Casey and tax expert Dale Craymer, each disputed Bius's claim that the funding plan caused property taxes to rocket, as Bius says in his ad. Craymer, who heads the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonprofit group representing businesses, was then-Gov. Ann Richards' budget director in 1993. Craymer said: "There really is no single bill that caused school district taxes to skyrocket, although a number of bills in combination have contributed to a steady increase in tax rates (and sharp increases in some districts) since 1984." Bius’s third claim—that Ogden wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit—reflects Ogden’s longstanding role as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Bius cites a 2009 article in the Fort Worth Business Press quoting Ogden saying: "In order to balance the budget this biennium, which is $182 billion, we used $14 billion in federal stimulus money to balance it. We’re not expecting a similar amount of similar money to be available in the next two years because the federal government just doesn’t have it. So, assuming that’s true, you go into the next session with a $14 billion hole." Ogden told us he wishes he hadn't said "hole" in that context. "We don’t have a deficit," he noted correctly -- a reminder that when observers refer to a shortfall, they mean that without making changes, the state might not have enough income to fund anticipated future expenses, not current ones. "That has nothing to do with the budget I crafted," Ogden said, suggesting instead that it largely reflects state sales tax revenue lagging what Combs projected it would be by this time. Ogden also insisted he’s not convinced there’ll be a shortfall when lawmakers gather next year to write the next budget. "It’s very accurate to say the (next) budget is going to be very tight," Ogden said, with lawmakers likely to tap the state’s so-called rainy day fund to cover costs. Bius traces his ad’s last claim, that Ogden voted against Second Amendment freedoms, to Ogden's vote last year against a proposal removing a state bar on individuals carrying concealed weapons onto Texas college campuses. Ogden, whose district includes Texas A&M University, was among 11 senators (and three Republicans) to vote against final passage of Senate Bill 1164, which later died in the House. Ogden said of his vote: "I voted to maintain the status quo. What’s that got to do with the Second Amendment?" He noted that the Bill of Rights in the Texas Constitution states that every citizen "shall have the right to keep and bear arms in the lawful defense of himself or the state, but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms, with a view to prevent crime." So how does Bius’s barrage shake out? He’s right that Ogden carried the measure launching the new business tax. But it’s at least debatable that the tax "hurt" all small businesses; that was not the conclusion of the state study. Bius fairly gives Ogden major credit -- or, rather, blame -- for writing the state budget, though he overlooks that Ogden shared that responsibility with House and Senate colleagues. Bius's ad misuses the "deficit" descriptive, taking advantage of Ogden's rued reference to lawmakers facing a $14 billion "hole" unless there's more federal stimulus aid. Finally, Bius ties his Second Amendment claim to a single Ogden vote. That's a well-worn way of casting aspersions. But without more instances of such behavior by Ogden, it’s a stretch to say his one vote proves him soft on gun rights. The ad's claims mostly misrepresent Ogden's record. We rate Bius’s statement as False.	None	Ben Bius	None	None	None	2010-02-16T21:36:35	2010-02-09	['None']
pomt-03580	Ken Lanci is a lifelong Clevelander	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/may/16/ken-lanci/ken-lanci-claims-he-lifelong-clevelander/	What makes a Clevelander? By one standard, it's geographic proximity to the city that gives the region its name. The Cleveland metropolitan statistical area, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, encompasses Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Geauga and Medina counties. The Cleveland combined statistical area adds Portage, Summit and Ashtabula. It's one reason why suburbanites who might properly be called Greater Clevelanders skip the "greater." By another standard, it's a matter of identity and attitude. By that measure, a Clevelander might be someone who can name starters on the '48 Indians or '64 Browns, define the terms lake effect squall, Moondog or Polish Boy, and can instantly identify the world's greatest orchestra while singing a verse from the I-X Indoor Amusement Park jingle. Strictly speaking, however, a Clevelander is defined by residence, as someone living within the city limits and Cleveland Metropolitan School District might remind you with pride, defiance or irritation. Until the Ohio Supreme Court in 2009 upheld a state law that prohibits municipalities from enforcing residency rules, municipal workers had to be Clevelanders as specifically defined by residence. By city charter and state law, the requirement remains for such officials as council members and mayor. That requirement is met by Ken Lanci, the businessman and philanthropist who announced his candidacy for mayor earlier this month. He lives in a downtown apartment. But PolitiFact Ohio was surprised by the declaration on his website and campaign materials that he is "a lifelong Clevelander" -- largely because Lanci described himself as a Gates Mills resident when he ran for Cuyahoga County executive in 2010. We asked his campaign how the statement is backed up. They answered with his official biography. Lanci was born to a family that relied on public assistance in his early years and lived in East Side neighborhoods on East 110th and East 117th streets. The family moved to Maple Heights when he was eight. Lanci started working part-time in Cleveland for his father at age 13, at Offset Color and Printing on East 30th Street, and worked full-time in Cleveland after graduating from Maple Heights High School. "In 1987," the biography says, "he began making substantial real estate investments within the city. For over 40 years, he has worked hard to create jobs and build businesses." The bio says Lanci's Consolidated Graphics Inc. and Consolidated Technologies Group have more than 150 employees, many of them Cleveland residents, and that their $25 million in annual sales translate into Cleveland jobs and taxes. "Ken's city payroll tax is consistently over $130,000 per year. His annual real estate tax is over $85,000 per year," the bio says. "While other firms were shutting down or migrating out of greater Cleveland, Ken Lanci stayed put on East 40th Street." Also noted is his work in Cleveland as a philanthropist. In 2007, he and his wife began sponsoring OneSight Cleveland, which provides free eye exams and glasses to underprivileged children in Cleveland schools. More than 4,000 children have received the eyeglasses, the campaign said. Lanci has been involved for more than 17 years in the character-building education and training program Project Love. The candidate also provided a list of more than 100 local organizations to which he has contributed support. Looking at past news coverage, we found even more. Lanci has, for example, sponsored the large annual Family Unity Day event at Luke Easter Park in Cleveland. We also found from past coverage that Lanci's experience in office came on the Northfield Village Council in the 1970s and '80s, when he lived in that Summit County community. He sold his home in Gates Mills in 2011 and became a renter in Brecksville, where he voted in the general election last November. Residency may say little, if anything, about a candidate's merits. It could be argued that making a move demonstrates commitment. But the limited history suggests that it can matter. James M. Carney, a lawyer, developer and former state legislator with extensive interests in downtown Cleveland, moved his voting residence from Fairview Park to run for mayor in 1971 and 1973. Ralph Perk, who was elected with a plurality in a three-way race, called him a "suburban carpetbagger." Seth Taft, a prominent attorney and civic reformer who later served as county commissioner, moved to Cleveland in 1967 to challenge Mayor Ralph Locher. Locher lost the Democratic primary to Carl Stokes, who branded Taft as "the Pepper Pike candidate." A current mayoral candidate in Toledo told the Blade this month that it was an "oversight" to say she was a "lifelong Toledoan" who lived in the city her whole life: "It should be 'the majority of my life since 1969,'" she said. We tapped the experience of John Grabowski, professor of history at Case Western Reserve University, historian at the Western Reserve Historical Society and editor of "The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History" and "Dictionary of Cleveland Biography." "I've heard that if you choose to root for a Cleveland sports team, you are a Clevelander," he said with a chuckle. "All sorts of ex-Clevelanders living all around the country still refer to themselves as Clevelanders. "It's an affinity. It's an origin story for a lot of people involving birthplace and family connection." Grabowski, born in Cleveland and a resident of Cleveland Heights, calls himself a Clevelander. Where does that leave the campaign statement that Lanci is a "lifelong Clevelander"? His claim is partially accurate. The record shows that Cleveland is Lanci's birthplace and hometown. He has spent his entire life in the Cleveland area, working in the city. His charitable works demonstrate community mindedness and commitment. Anyone from another part of Ohio, much less another part of the country, would reasonably call him a Clevelander. But perspective changes in close-up and in context. In this context, being a Clevelander is more than a state of mind. Specific residency requirements attach to running for mayor, and in those terms, there are specific details that are important to consider in evaluating his claim. As both supporters and opponents of regionalism will attest, municipal boundaries matter. Lanci leased an apartment within Cleveland’s boundaries to meet the residency requirement for mayor. He graduated from high school in another community. He has had residencies and voted in other communities. At one point he served in local government in another community. In running for mayor of the city, Lanci is seeking the votes of an electorate he has never previously been part of. A statement that has some accuracy but is lacking important details that are needed to put it into context gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True.

pomt-05018	"Bill O'Brien's Tea Party legislature tried to repeal kindergarten and compulsory education, defund Planned Parenthood and eliminate insurance coverage for birth control."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/16/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-democrats-heap-blame-speaker-bill-obrien-and-hi/	Apparently, Siri may not have all the answers. In a Web advertisement mimicking ads for Apple’s new Siri digital assistant, the New Hampshire Democratic Party takes aim at House Speaker William O’Brien and his "Tea Party legislature." "Bill O'Brien's Tea Party legislature tried to repeal kindergarten and compulsory education," the assistant tells the unnamed voter in the ad, "College vs. Smokes." They tried to "defund Planned Parenthood and eliminate insurance coverage for birth control. … On November 6, we must vote this radical Tea Party majority out of office." Siri may know a lot of things, but does it know the ins and outs of the New Hampshire legislature? We decided to check the tape. To get to the answer, we broke the claim down to four parts: the kindergarten charge, compulsory education, Planned Parenthood and insurance coverage for birth control. In its ad, the Democratic party points to specific pieces of legislation for each claim, so it wasn’t hard to connect the dots. 1) Repeal kindergarten To support its kindergarten claim, the Democrats point to H.B. 631, considered during the 2011 legislative session. As the ad claims, the bill, sponsored by state Rep. Jonathan Maltz, R-Hudson, did in fact propose to repeal the state mandate requiring school districts to provide kindergarten programs. It reads, "This bill repeals the requirement that all school districts offer public kindergarten, and exempts those school districts that implemented a public kindergarten program … from the kindergarten construction grant repayment penalty." But, what the ad fails to mention is the bill failed to gain much traction in the House, either among Democrats or from O’Brien’s Republican majority. Members of the House Education committee, made up of 13 Republicans and four Democrats, recommended killing the bill with a 12-3 vote, and once it reached the House floor Feb. 23, 2011, representatives voted 213-134 to shoot it down, including 126 of 260 Republicans who voted against the bill. "This bill was introduced because of the questionable constitutional mandate of a couple of years ago. However, since every school district now has kindergarten, this bill would be superfluous," state Rep. Ralph Boehm, vice-chairman of the education committee, wrote in the committee’s recommendation. We rate this part of the claim Mostly False. 2) Repeal compulsory education By the time it reached the House floor, the compulsory education bill didn’t do much to address compulsory education. In its original form, H.B. 542 included provisions proposing to repeal attendance requirements in public schools. But, that proposal drew heavy criticism and the House Education committee amended the bill to focus on objectionable material in the classroom. The amended bill, which allows parents to object to any course material and request alternative curriculum, passed the committee by a 12-6 vote and was eventually approved by the full House 197-148. Gov. John Lynch vetoed the amended bill, but both the House and the Senate voted to override the Governor’s veto, and it became law Jan. 4, 2012. As it stands now, the law makes no mention of compulsory education or attendance requirements. Legislators have promised to pursue the compulsory education matter in a separate, free standing bill. So at this point, there is little evidence to back up the Democrats' claim. We rate this portion False. 3) Defund Planned Parenthood The Planned Parenthood part of the claim may be closer to the truth. With H.B. 228, House Republicans voted in January to ban the use of taxpayer dollars to fund Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers. The bill, sponsored by Robert Willette, R-Milford, initially earned a tough reception from the Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs committee, which recommended killing the bill in a 12-5 vote. But, after then-Majority Leader D.J. Bettencourt asked his colleagues to delay a vote, O’Brien, the House Speaker, worked to shape an amendment that made the bill more palatable to House lawmakers. On Jan. 18, 2012, the House approved the amendment, which proposed to allow hospitals to use public dollars to fund emergency abortions, and the full House reversed the committee’s recommendation and passed the bill by a 207-147 vote. Two months later, the state Senate voted to lay the matter on the table, letting it die a polite death. Still, the House Republicans voted in favor of de-funding Planned Parenthood, so this portion earns a True. 4) Eliminate insurance coverage for birth control Lastly, we get to the issue of insurance coverage for birth control. H.B. 1546, the bill referenced in the ad, didn’t start as a birth control proposal. Initially, it intended to re-codify laws relating to religious groups, including membership, donation and corporate powers. But, after O’Brien and several other House Republicans reworked it, the bill provided an exemption for groups with religious objections from providing insurance coverage for birth control and contraception. The amendment, which passed the House Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification committee by a 10-6 vote, added language to the bill saying "No employer shall be required to include in its coverage for its employees the provisions of this section if the employer has a religious objection." The amended bill then passed the full House in a 196-150 vote, led by the Republican leadership team. "No religious intuition or employer should be forced to pay for services they find morally objectionable, and with this bill we will have paved the way on the state level," Bettencourt, the House Majority Leader, said at the time in a written statement. The following month, the state Senate referred the bill to interim study, leading to its eventual death. But, even if it had passed into law, the bill would not, as the Democratic Party suggests, eliminated insurance coverage for birth control. Instead, it would have allowed employers with religious objections to decline to include birth control under its health insurance plans. That's a big difference from eliminating coverage for birth control, as the ad claimed. This portion gets a Mostly False. Our ruling: The state Democratic Party included many claims in this 110-second ad, and one of them is on track. Of the four included in this statement, the ad is spot on about O’Brien and the Republican Majority’s push to defund Planned Parenthood. But, the ad is off the mark in other areas. The proposal to repeal the kindergarten mandate got little support from either party and was ushered to a quick death; the push to do away with compulsory education was removed from the associated bill before it reached the House floor; and, finally, with the birth control bill, House Republicans sought to allow some employers to decline to include birth control in their insurance coverage, not to eliminate coverage entirely. Of these charges, the Democratic Party is shooting 1-4. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	New Hampshire Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-07-16T10:17:55	2012-07-06	['Planned_Parenthood']

pomt-01086	"There are actual cities" like Birmingham, England, "that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/14/steven-emerson/fox-news-guest-steven-emerson-says-birmingham-tota/	Sometimes a claim is so egregious that a prime minister chokes on his porridge. So infuriating that international backlash spurs a sassy hashtag and leads the speaker to apologize profusely the very next day. So wrong that even though it’s already been widely debunked, people are still asking that we give it the PunditFact treatment. Such is the case with a comment about Birmingham, England, by news pundit Steve Emerson, who appeared as a guest Jan. 10, 2015, on Fox News’ Justice with Judge Jeanine. Host Jeanine Pirro introduced Emerson as founder of The Investigative Project on Terrorism for a segment about "no-go" zones for non-Muslims in Europe. Emerson said the zones exist in France and throughout the rest of Europe as "safe havens" for Muslims ruled by Sharia courts and not a country’s own laws. "In Britain, it’s not just no-go zones," Emerson said. "There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim, where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in. And parts of London, there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire." Western Europe is just not dealing with the situation, he said. Western Europe, meanwhile, did not seem amused by his comment. And make no mistake, the claim is wrong. The city of Birmingham, situated north and west of London, has more than 1 million residents. There are more whites and Christians than any other ethnicity or religion, we found. According to a report of the 2011 UK Census by the Birmingham City Council, 46 percent of residents said they were Christian and 22 percent, or 234,111 people, identified as Muslim. No doubt, Islam is a growing and popular faith in Birmingham, up 7.5 percentage points from 2001 to 2011. Three Birmingham wards, Heath, Bordesley Green and Sparkbrook, had Muslim populations that exceeded half of the population, all ranging from 70 percent to about 77 percent. Not that this gives any credence to Emerson’s claim about the city of Birmingham as a whole. This does not amount to the city "being totally Muslim." Emerson apologized on his website and on the BBC, among other forums, for his remarks. He attributed his statement about Birmingham to sloppy fact-checking. (No kidding.) Here is the apology: I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error. And I am issuing this apology and correction for having made this comment about the beautiful city of Birmingham. I do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that I had relied on other sources because I should have been much more careful. There was no excuse for making this mistake and I owe an apology to every resident of Birmingham. I am not going to make any excuses. I made an inexcusable error. And I am obligated to openly acknowledge that mistake. I wish to apologize for all residents of that great city of Birmingham. Steve Emerson PS. I am making (a) donation to Birmingham Children's Hospital. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who really did say the remark caused him to choke on his porridge, called Emerson a "complete idiot." "He started with an apology," Cameron said. "That's not a bad start. But what he should do is look at Birmingham and see what a fantastic example it is bringing people together of different faiths and different backgrounds and building a world-class brilliant city with a great and strong economy." A note about Emerson’s other point, that in parts of London there are "actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire." While there are no official Muslim religious police, there have been some reports of "Muslim patrols" or "Sharia patrols" trying to make people in parts of East London follow Islamic law, and three people were jailed for doing so in 2013. But there’s little information to suggest the patrols are widespread or involve many people. Our ruling Emerson said Birmingham is a city in England that is totally Muslim, "where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in." He has since admitted that is inaccurate, and for good reason. The stats say Birmingham is about 20 percent Muslim. All that is left to say is Emerson’s statement rates Pants on Fire!

pomt-03547	Says that since he took office, "there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-he-took-office-there-have-been-n/	President Barack Obama talked about terrorism and drones in a major speech on May 23, 2013. At one point, Obama said "there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States" since the start of his presidency, adding, "Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11." We wondered whether he was accurate when he said "there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States" since his presidency began. We were particularly interested in this question because we recently rated a claim by Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., that "in barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama," compared to zero "in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush." We gave Cotton’s claim a Mostly False, but that statement has important differences in wording that led us to take a look at Obama’s claim as well. We see two terrorist attacks during Obama’s tenure that could be considered "large scale." One is the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect and is now awaiting a military trial. The other incident is the bombing at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, that killed three and injured more than 260. Officials are still determining the extent of the role played by Islamic extremism in the accused bombers’ motivations. (We aren’t including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, Libya, because it didn’t take place on the U.S. mainland.) The White House argues that Obama is accurate because neither Fort Hood nor Boston qualify as coordinated attacks on the scale of the 9/11 attacks. The White House also notes that Obama mentioned both attacks elsewhere in his speech. Since the definition of ‘large scale" is in the eye of the beholder, we reached out to terrorism experts for guidance. They saw two key yardsticks for determining whether an attack is "large scale." Was the plot connected to a broad terrorist network? A plot can be "large scale" if it is logistically complicated and draws in resources from many directions. Prior to the Fort Hood shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida. Hasan sought out al-Awlaki for support and inspiration, but other than that, there is scant evidence that the incident was planned and carried out by an international terrorist network. As for the Boston attack, investigators are still trying to determine how much assistance, if any, either of the Tsarnaevs got from other terrorists. But for now, at least, no hard evidence has emerged. In general, then, both Hasan and the Tsarnaevs are considered more akin to "lone-wolf" terrorists who self-radicalized, rather than people who carried out a terrorist attack devised by a larger terrorist gang. "Without the direct involvement of a more organized group and in view of other elements, they are more difficult to qualify as large scale," said Mathieu Deflem, a sociologist specializing in terrorism at the University of South Carolina. They both involved "lone-wolf perpetrators who lacked direct connections or instructions from an organized group." How many were killed? The attacks in Fort Hood and Boston both caused more deaths than several other terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, including a 2002 shooting at the Los Angeles airport (two killed), a 2006 vehicular attack at the University of North Carolina (injuries only) and a 2009 shooting at a U.S. Army recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark. (two killed). But they were far less than the 9/11 attacks or other major attacks of recent years. Terrorist attack Deaths Injuries 9/11 attacks (2001) 2,992 thousands Tanzania-Kenya embassy bombings (1998) 250 thousands Madrid bombings (2004) 191 1,800+ London bombings (2005) 52 700+ Ft. Hood shootings (2009) 13 30+ Boston Marathon bombing (2013) 3 260+ Indeed, two non-terrorist-related school shootings, at Virginia Tech (32 dead in 2007) and in Newtown, Conn. (27 dead in 2012), left more than twice as many dead as Fort Hood and about 10-times as many as were killed in Boston. "If you use mass shootings as a baseline, then (Obama) is accurate," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed that Obama is "on solid ground here," adding that "it's important to keep in mind the sort of predictions about large-scale attack that were common after 9/11. All sorts of people predicted recurring if not regular mass casualty attacks that killed many hundreds," and that hasn’t happened. On the other hand, the Boston bombing did result in many more injuries than either school shooting, and we think that most people would think an attack that indiscriminately injures 260 people, many with lost limbs, would qualify as "large scale." Indeed, the definitions of "large-scale" are sufficiently vague that there’s a lot of room for Obama, or his critics, to either burnish or damage the administration’s record on terrorism. There’s also a question of how much Obama can take credit -- or be blamed -- for the number of terrorist attacks on his watch. "Why would thwarted attacks not count?" said Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "That's like being a hockey goalie who has stopped lots of shots and then says, ‘Gee, they haven’t scored, so I guess the game must be over.’" Our ruling Obama said that since he has taken office, "there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States." Two attacks on Obama’s watch that might qualify as "large scale" -- the Fort Hood shootings and the Boston Marathon bombing. They caused substantially fewer deaths than the biggest terrorist attacks of recent years, and they are believed to have been carried out by "lone wolf" attackers with limited connections to large-scale terrorist networks. But where to draw the line between small, medium and large attacks is open to interpretation. Obama's formulation is plausible, but not the only one. We rate it Half True.

pomt-09079	"Sen. George LeMieux voted to let oil companies off the hook and overturn pollution rules."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/25/florida-conservation-alliance/florida-environmental-group-hits-lemieux-big-oil-v/	In late June 2010, the Florida Conservation Alliance -- an affiliate of the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group -- bought what it called a "substantial" amount of television time in the Tampa Bay area to run an ad critical of Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla. Here's the narration: "It’s the worst oil disaster in American history, and Floridians are bracing for the consequences. But at a time when we need leaders who will fight for Florida’s economy and environment, Sen. George LeMieux voted to let oil companies off the hook and overturn pollution rules. Senator, when you fight to protect our coasts, we’re with you. But when you stand with Big Oil, you let us down. Call Senator LeMieux. Tell him not to disappoint us again, and to support a strong, clean energy future." The visuals were almost exclusively tied to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- oil gushing underwater, soiled beaches, petroleum-soaked birds, the flaming Deepwater Horizon oil rig. In this sense, the ad reminded us of one we rated recently that had been placed in several media markets by Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group. In both ads, the focus on the oil spill -- in both the narration and the visuals -- suggested to us that reasonable people would assume that the vote "to let big oil off the hook" would have something to do with the spill itself, such as a vote to limit BP's liability for paying damages. In reality, both ads refer to a different measure in Congress -- one that has nothing directly to do with the oil spill itself. The vote cited in an on-screen footnote was on a procedural motion to take up a joint resolution sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. This measure would disapprove a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency that classified greenhouse gasses as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That classification would allow the EPA to act to curb emissions by big polluters that could be causing global warming. The resolution was the latest salvo in a fight between industry and environmentalists over curbing emissions. The EPA effort, blocked during the administration of George W. Bush, was revived after Barack Obama became president. The vote was seen as a key preliminary decision in advance of possible Senate consideration of a "cap-and-trade" emissions bill -- a major bone of contention between the parties. Major oil companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if the EPA acts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, since burning oil and other fossil fuels produces a lot of carbon dioxide. It's worth noting that the resolution failed, 47 to 53, so the Senate never really wiped out what the group terms "protections that hold polluters accountable." But there's little question that the vote was important. "If ever there was a vote to find out whose side you are on, this is it," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But was it related to the oil spill? Not really. And to us, that makes it an example of an ad that isn't wrong, but is misleading. The ad says nothing about the specific topic of the vote at issue -- be it greenhouse gasses, emissions, or global warming -- but it does mention the oil spill several times in the narration. And almost all of the imagery highlights the spill. To us, the ad's strong implication is that the vote had something to do with law or policy relating directly to the spill. In our earlier ruling, we gave the Americans United for Change ad a Half True, arguing that it overplayed its hand on the oil spill to such a degree that it risked misleading viewers about the nature of the vote being criticized. While the ad by the Florida Conservation Alliance uses somewhat different language, the message strikes us as essentially the same. We rate this ad Half True as well.

pomt-03635	Says proponents of a bond package for the Austin school district say the district has the second-lowest bond tax rate "among the Central Texas area school districts."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/03/league-women-voters-austin-area/guide-says-proponents-bond-package-say-austin-scho/	A guide to upcoming Austin-area elections says advocates of a bond package benefiting the Austin school district maintain the district hasn’t overly burdened taxpayers. According to the Voters Guide prepared by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, proponents of the $892 million bond package say: "The bond tax rate for Austin ISD is presently the second lowest among the Central Texas area districts." The guide was published April 28, 2013, a day before early voting commenced in advance of the May 11 election featuring the four-part bond package. By phone, league volunteer Nan Clayton, a former member of Austin’s school board, told us she believes the claim originated from a chart published next to an Austin American-Statesman news article, though she conceded she might have misread published information about the total tax rates of about 10 area districts. A slide included in a Feb. 25, 2013, Austin district presentation on budget issues indicates that this year, the Austin district has the second-lowest overall tax, of $1.242 per $100 in assessed property, rate of 10 Austin-area districts. This rate reflects the rate levied to pay for maintenance and operations plus a smaller share (sometimes called "interest and sinking") rate levied by districts to pay the interest and principal on district-issued bonds, usually for construction of facilities and other capital needs. We took this smaller portion to be the "bond tax rate" declared in the Voters Guide. This year, the slide shows, Travis County’s Eanes district has a lower overall tax rate, $1.2125 per $100 in assessed property value, than Austin. The slide shows districts with higher rates as Round Rock, Lake Travis, Hays, Bastrop, Leander, Manor, Del Valle and Pflugerville. But the Austin district has the lowest debt tax rate of these districts, at 16.3 cents per $100 in assessed property, with the Eanes district second at 17.25 cents per $100 valuation, according to the slide. Then again, the claim in the guide speaks to the lowest rates "among the Central Texas districts." So we launched our own review of area debt tax rates on the rates in about 30 districts across Travis County and neighboring Hays, Bastrop and Williamson counties. Upshot: The Austin district’s debt rate is lower than those in most of the districts. However, seven districts--those in Wimberley, Johnson City and the burgs of Florence, Bartlett, McDade, Granger and Coupland, a district with instruction through 8th grade that has a zero debt rate--have lower rates than Austin. Appraised of our findings, Austin district spokesman Antonio Lujan initially said by email that the districts with lower rates "are not considered Central Texas," while, conversely, the Austin district’s slide was limited to Central Texas districts. Historically, Lujan later added, "we have not been compared to the smaller districts you mentioned, even though ‘geographically speaking’ they may be in the central area of the state." Our ruling Bond proponents say the Austin school district has the second-lowest bond tax rate "among the Central Texas area school districts." Austin’s debt or bond rate is lower than the rates in most of about 30 Austin-area districts. But seven districts have lower rates--and while we'd agree these small, mostly rural districts should rarely rate direct comparison to the larger Austin district, they are indisputably in Central Texas. (President Johnson would guffaw at the notion that Johnson City is anywhere else.) We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True.

pomt-01208	Citing his efforts to secure the border, Obama said, "Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is the lowest it has been since the 1970s."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/nov/25/barack-obama/obama-says-illegal-border-crossings-lowest-it-has-/	During his speech to the nation about his executive action on immigration, President Barack Obama talked up his efforts to secure the border. Obama argued that those efforts paid off as the numbers of illegal border crossings are the lowest they have been in decades. "When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history," Obama said Nov. 20. Then Obama reeled off a few statistics, including this one: "Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts." We decided to check if those are indeed the facts regarding the number of illegal crossings. Number of illegal immigrants apprehended We can’t know for certain how many illegal immigrants have tried to cross the border. We can only examine data that show how many have been apprehended or managed to settle here. As PunditFact explained earlier this year, there is more than one way to measure the pressure at the border. You can look at total apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol, or you can look at changes in the estimates of the undocumented population in the country. Neither is perfect, but the first option of using apprehension numbers has the advantage of at least being based on actual reports of people detained by federal agents rather than surveys by the Census Bureau. Also, we can’t use the Census to evaluate Obama’s comparison to 1970 because it wasn’t until the 1980s that the Census began to track the number of undocumented immigrants. Another potential source is Homeland Security data, which combines apprehensions at the border and interior. Because Obama’s statement was specifically about the border, we will start by looking at Border Patrol data. The White House also directed us to these statistics. Year Border apprehensions 1970 231,116 1971 302,517 1972 396,495 1973 498,123 1974 634,777 1975 596,796 1976 696,039 1977 812,541 1978 862,837 1979 888,729 Source: U.S. Border Patrol As you can see in the chart, the number of annual apprehensions was 231,116 in 1970 and climbed throughout the decade, ending at just shy of 900,000 apprehensions in 1979. From 1983 through 2006, the number of border apprehensions exceeded 1 million nearly every year. The numbers began to dip before Obama’s first term. In 2007, the Border Patrol apprehended 876,704 people. That figure dropped over the next four years, but there was an uptick starting in 2012, with border apprehensions hitting 420,789 in 2013. 2009 556,041 2010 463,382 2011 340,252 2012 364,768 2013 420,789 Source: U.S. Border Patrol The AP reported that the number rose to 486,651 in 2014, but a Border Patrol spokesman could not confirm that number because the agency has not yet released its number for the 2013-14 fiscal year. It’s possible that the number for 2014 will be higher than 2013, but we’re going to hold Obama to the confirmed 2013 figure for now. By that measure, the number of people trying to cross the border is the lowest it has been since part of the 1970s. The last time it was lower than the apprehensions in 2013 was 1972. The numbers don’t tell the full story There are some caveats about the data, particularly comparing more recent years to the 1970s. In the 1970s, there were far fewer Border Patrol agents and no barriers, such as fences, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. That led to a lot of people crossing or attempting to cross multiple times. "Agents frequently reported catching the same people several times each shift," she said. "People would cross illegally just to go shopping and return home. Some would work for brief periods and come home for awhile and then go back." Why is that important? It means we have no idea, when using 1970s numbers, how many different people were apprehended, as some could have been apprehended multiple times. "So, 10 apprehensions might mean 10 people entering once or 1 person apprehended 10 times," Georgetown professor Susan Martin told PolitiFact. With the addition of fencing and more agents in more recent years, people use smugglers to cross the border, which is more expensive and results in less traffic. In the 1990s, the strategy changed from trying to apprehend as many people as possible to trying to deter them from entering in the first place, Martin said. Federal officials used sensors, cameras and other technology to identify recidivists and get a better sense of the actual numbers. Vaughan argued that the border situation is so different now from the 1970s that "the comparison is pointless." However, some of the professors we interviewed said we can still draw comparisons over time despite shortcomings about the data or changes in border strategy. In the 1970s, the country did not have have criminal penalties for those who were deported and then re-entered illegally, Cornell University law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr told PolitiFact. However, it is hard to know whether those penalties have a deterrent effect. "No historical comparison is perfect, in immigration or elsewhere," Yale-Loehr said. "In short, it is hard to compare apprehension statistics between one year and another to measure their effectiveness. In the absence of any other yardstick, however, I can’t fault a president for trying." University of Virginia law Professor David Martin said cross-decade comparisons are okay even though they are imprecise. "I feel pretty confident that the level of crossings is lower now than at any time since the 1970s – a great deal more of the border is under tighter surveillance and control, owing to a far larger Border Patrol, changed control strategies, and deployment of all sorts of technology," he told PolitiFact. Another thing to note is that enforcement isn’t the only factor in the number of apprehensions each year. In recent years, illegal immigration has declined from Mexico in part due to improved job prospects there and the recession here. Meanwhile, apprehensions of immigrants from countries other than Mexico are on the rise. "Moreover, the rate of apprehensions can’t be measured just by the number of Border Patrol agents at the border," Martin said. "Sometimes economic factors, such as the Great Recession of 2009, may play a large role in a decline in apprehensions." Our ruling Obama said, "Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is the lowest it has been since the 1970s." We cannot directly check Obama's literal claim -- which would include the number of people who failed and succeeeded to cross the border -- because those statistics are not maintained by the federal government. Instead, we turned to the data that most closely aligned with what he was trying to say. Using Border Patrol data, we found Obama is correct on the sheer numbers for the number of people caught trying to cross the border. In 2013, about 420,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended at the border. The last time it was lower than that was 1972. After that year, apprehensions steadily rose throughout the 1970s, ending at just shy of 900,000 in 1979. Experts noted, however, that Obama is creating an imperfect comparison because the border situation was far different in 1970 than it is in more recent years. In the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple attempts or excursions illegally across the border. On a final note, it's problematic for Obama to assume credit for the low numbers, as the trend started before he took office and the flows of immigrants across the border tends to correlate with economic conditions at least partially outside of the president's control.

pomt-09508	The stimulus includes "$7 million to build a bridge in Thedford, Nebraska, to help 168 residents avoid a 30-second wait at a local train crossing. Not one full-time job will be created."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/19/john-boehner/boehner-says-stimulus-includes-7-million-bridge-ov/	In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent. "I was still concerned -- Joe (Biden) and I were just talking in the back -- when this thing passed we said $787 billion -- somewhere there’s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent; $787 billion spent out over 18 months, that's a lot -- that's a lot of money," Obama said. "And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that, as Joe puts it, the dog, so far at least, hasn't barked." On the same day Obama made his speech, House Republican Leader John Boehner issued a press release saying the stimulus is "chock-full of wasteful government spending." And he attached a list of 19 "real world" examples. We took a look at several items on Boehner's list to see if they were as billed. In this item, we examine the claim that the stimulus includes "$7 million to build a bridge in Thedford, Nebraska, to help 168 residents avoid a 30-second wait at a local train crossing. Not one full-time job will be created." This one leaped to national fame thanks to a Jan. 28, 2010, report on CNN. Based on the population of Thedford, the reporter stated, "That means the project cost of $6.9 million breaks down to $41,000 per resident on paper." It's true that $7 million in stimulus funds was awarded to build a viaduct allowing traffic to pass over BNSF Railway tracks on U.S. 83 in Thedford, instead of crossing directly on the tracks. And it's fair to say, based on those quoted in the CNN report as well as in the Omaha World-Herald on July 19, 2009, that a lot of locals think it's a huge waste of money. But the two-sentence description in the Boehner release presents a slightly distorted picture. While the population of Thedford is 168, about 1,273 vehicles a day cross the tracks and about 60 trains a day pass through, according to the World-Herald. And while some locals say the wait for a train passing is sometimes as short as 20 seconds (or as long as 3 minutes), Nebraska Department of Roads officials cited safety, not convenience, concerns as the impetus for the project (though no accidents have been reported at the crossing). Nebraska officials told the Omaha World-Herald that U.S. 83 serves as a main route between two cities, and that a train derailment or track maintenance could shut the crossing down for an extended time. The nearest north-south route is at least 25 miles away. "It’s a project that qualifies under our rules and regs, and it's a good project. It eliminates a lot of exposure, and it provides some tremendous continuity to our highway system," Ellis Tompkins, rail and public transportation engineer with the roads department, told the World-Herald. We're not going to weigh in on the merits of the project, but we did want to point out one other distortion in the Boehner claim, that "not one full-time job will be created" by the project. The CNN report notes that only a few locals were hired as temps, including a woman who worked part-time for a couple of months for $10 an hour waving a flag. A Colorado contractor won the bid for the project and is using its own out-of-state workers. So locals complained that it wasn't creating jobs for people in Thedford. But that doesn't mean it didn't create any jobs -- only that those jobs went to people in Colorado, less than 100 miles away. So Boehner has the project and the pricetag correct, but we think it's misleading to claim the bridge only leads to a town of 168, when it is crossed more than 1,200 times a day. And the claim that it has not created any jobs is wrong. It might not create any full-time jobs for Thedford residents, but it will for those employed by the Colorado company that got the multimilion dollar contract. And so we rule this claim Half True.

pomt-08489	Said he "opposed every budget Republican and Democrat."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/11/jim-marshall/marshall-voted-against-budget-resolutions-not-nece/	Democrat Jim Marshall is in the fight of his political life this year in his Middle Georgia congressional district. Republicans have tried to unseat Marshall in the past. And they have always failed. But the GOP hopes a fired-up base this year coupled with GOP state lawmaker Austin Scott of Tifton, the Republican nominee for the 8th District, can finally topple the seemingly indestructible Marshall. A former Army Ranger and winner of two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart, the 62-year-old Marshall is firing back with a campaign video in which he attempts to distance himself from national Democrats and run-amok federal spending. "In Congress, both sides are addicted to deficits, so I’ve opposed every budget Republican and Democrat," Marshall says in the ad. That’s a bold claim. And it should be simple enough to check out, we at PolitiFact Georgia innocently reckoned. Then we waded into the morass of the federal budget process with all its nuance, double talk, triple talk and outright mendacity. Here’s how a couple of experts describe Uncle Sam’s budget: "The term ‘budget process,’ when applied to the federal government, actually refers to a number of processes that have evolved separately and that occur with varying degrees of coordination," said James V. Saturno of the Congressional Research Service. Said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: "There is no ‘The Budget’ when you talk about federal spending." Marshall spokesman Doug Moore said Marshall was talking about the annual "budget resolution," which outlines federal spending for five or more years. It is the blueprint for most federal spending. And Marshall has indeed voted against the budget resolution every year. "This [the budget resolution] is your only opportunity to weigh in on mandatory spending," Moore said. "If you don’t like the debt the country will take on, you vote against the budget. If you think that the priorities are out of alignment, you do it here." Moore points out that the budget resolution covers mandatory federal spending, or about two-thirds of the total budget -- everything from Social Security to Medicaid. Congress also votes on about a dozen separate appropriations bill every year. Those bills fund discretionary federal spending. They account for about one-third of the budget and fund everything from military operations to road building. Scott’s campaign manager, Joby Young, agreed Marshall has voted against budget resolutions. But Marshall has voted in favor of all but five federal spending bills during his eight years in Congress, Young said. Moore said Scott’s campaign is cherry-picking votes in an attempt to discredit Marshall, a co-founder of the Balanced Budget Caucus and a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative Democrats. The yearly spending bill is where the budget rubber meets the road, Scott’s campaign argues, and it is where Marshall should be held accountable. "The budget resolution is nonbinding and does not become law," Scott campaign spokesman Sam Ray said. "Jim Marshall has voted for 87 percent of the appropriations measures which did become law and spent trillions." Ray added, "He is voting against the playbook but running all of the plays." Congressional voting records show that Marshall voted for the $787 billion stimulus and the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. But he voted against President Barack Obama’s health care proposal and Obama’s proposed budget. So where does this leave us on Marshall’s claim that he has opposed all budgets -- regardless of the party proposing them? We talked to budget experts from think tanks of various stripes, from left-leaning to Libertarian to conservative -- the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the New America Foundation. The experts concurred that the budget resolution is an important part of the budget process. But they also concluded that strictly talking about the budget resolution without discussing the underlying spending bills omits critical context. Marshall’s statement is accurate, but it leaves out important details that could lead viewers of his campaign video to a different conclusion. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-12619	"The Notebook is finally getting a sequel. Producers of the upcoming film confirmed .... that filming will begin in Jacksonville, North Carolina this summer."	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/still-no-notebook-2-despite-fake-news-rumors-well-/	Fans of The Notebook have waited even longer for a sequel to the beloved movie than Allie waited for Noah. Some of them rejoiced recently when news broke that The Notebook 2 was already set to film on the North Carolina coast. "The very popular 2004 romantic drama film The Notebook is finally getting a sequel," reported the website WBN10. "Producers of the upcoming film confirmed the news today and announced that filming will begin in Jacksonville, North Carolina this summer." It later continues with some key details, sure to excite locals: "The film will take place primarily in the Jacksonville area and will film on location there as well. A casting call for extras will reportedly take place in the Jacksonville area in a couple of months." We were intrigued, and broke out a box of tissues just in case the tears started flowing. It wouldn’t be too crazy of an announcement. Sequels are all the rage in Hollywood these days, and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has said he wants to bring back the state’s tax credit for film projects – a campaign promise we’ve rated as In The Works on our Coop-O-Meter. What’s more, Nicholas Sparks – author of "The Notebook" and other popular books – lives in New Bern, not far from Jacksonville. Many of his books are set in North Carolina, and a few of the film versions have been shot here, too, including "A Walk To Remember," "Safe Haven" and "The Longest Ride." The state’s official tourism bureau even has a guide for a three-day trip around eastern North Carolina, which it calls "A Nicholas Sparks Tour of the North Carolina Coast." And Sparks has written a sequel to The Notebook, which is called The Wedding and hasn’t been made into a movie – yet. The stars seemed to align for this rumor. But sadly, it’s fake news. ' See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A quick search online led to something almost as good as a real movie announcement – a video clip of Conan O’Brien and Ryan Reynolds reenacting The Notebook’s famous kissing-in-the-rain scene, which they jokingly claimed was a trailer for The Notebook 2. This sequel, they said, would be starring Reynolds in the place of Ryan Gosling and O’Brien in the place of Rachel McAdams. So we were pretty sure his Notebook 2 announcement was a joke. But the article circulating about Jacksonville and the film was not nearly so satirical. It correctly named the director of the first film and the place in South Carolina where it was filmed, it gives a brief outline of the plot and has several quotes from unnamed producers from the unnamed company that was allegedly behind the film. The website does contain a disclaimer that it’s a satirical site, but it takes an extra click or two to find and isn’t immediately obvious. And just in case the website had accidentally stumbled onto the truth, we checked with the people who would know if there actually are plans for this movie in the works. Alas, they say, there’s no Notebook 2. "We have not been contacted by this production," said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission in eastern North Carolina. He would know; his office was in charge of collecting resumes from local crew members the last time a Sparks movie actually filmed in the area – which was "The Longest Ride" in 2014. And the N.C. Department of Commerce, which oversees the N.C. Film Office, said there was no Notebook 2 project anywhere in the state. "The Film Office is not working on/with any "Notebook 2" project," Commerce Department spokesman David Rhoades said in an email. Our ruling No, there isn’t a sequel to The Notebook being filmed in North Carolina. Not everything that looks like legitimate news actually is.

pomt-01294	A new Colorado law "literally allows residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to ‘collectors.’ "	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/30/megyn-kelly/megyn-kellys-errant-claim-about-colorado-voters-pr/	Fox News host Megyn Kelly began a recent show with explosive news out of Colorado, where she said "a new law has opened the door to possible voter fraud" just weeks before voters decide a crucial U.S. Senate race. Before you can say yikes, there’s more. This law, Kelly said, "literally allows residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to ‘collectors’ in what appears to be an effort to do away with traditional polling places." "What could go wrong?" Kelly asked before bringing on special guests Michelle Malkin and Citizens United president David Bossie to discuss their conservative documentary Rocky Mountain Heist, which details how the state turned from red to blue. In the days that followed, Colorado-based TV stations as well as The Rachel Maddow Show said Kelly’s segment was misleading and wrong. A reader asked for our take. In 2013, Colorado enacted a law (HB 1303) that moved the state to an "all-mail" absentee voting system, among other changes. Every active voter gets a ballot sent to his or her residence, and they can choose to mail it in by Election Day or turn it into a county clerk’s office. They can also still vote in person at a voting service and polling center. We repeat, the ballot is mailed to them -- they don’t print it out. Voters can also give their ballot to someone they trust to turn in for them -- what Kelly refers to as a "collector." That person is not allowed to turn in more than 10 ballots. The Colorado law, championed by Democrats and signed into law by Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, also authorizes same-day voter registration. Meanwhile, military or overseas Colorado voters have access to an online ballot they can fill out and send back to county elections clerks via email, fax or mail. Some military personnel who reside within the United States, or even station within Colorado, also have this option, said Rich Coolidge, Colorado Department of State spokesman. This was not a new change ushered in by HB 1303. But everyone else is on the normal mail-in system, which also exists in Oregon and Washington state. Kelly addressed the criticism about her original comments during her Oct. 27 show: "Last week, we said the new law also allows all voters to print out their ballots at home," she said. "That actually is not the case. Members of the military and some others, like Coloradans overseas, can indeed print out their ballots at home, but this is the case even before the new law passed." Our ruling In a recent segment, Kelly went after a new Colorado law that raises fears of voter fraud for allowing "residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to ‘collectors.’" That’s wrong, a fact Kelly later admitted. The big change in Colorado with the 2014 midterm elections is a universal mail-in system for active, registered voters. Those ballots are mailed to voters; voters do not print them out. The only people who have access to an online system are members of the military and Coloradoans who live overseas, and that system predates the most recent law. Kelly’s claim rates False.

pomt-00749	"ISIS camp a few miles from Texas, Mexican authorities confirm."	false	/texas/statements/2015/apr/17/judicial-watch/judicial-watch-says-isis-has-camp-mexico-and-near-/	A conservative watchdog group just declared terrorists active in Syria and Iraq and other parts of the Middle East also have a camp in Mexico--just a few miles from El Paso. In a six-paragraph web post, "ISIS Camp a Few Miles from Texas, Mexican Authorities Confirm," Judicial Watch said that according to anonymous sources including a Mexican Army "field grade officer and Mexican Federal Police inspector," ISIS is operating a camp around eight miles from the U.S. border in an area known as Anapra just west of Ciudad Juárez, which adjoins El Paso. Its April 14, 2015 post quoted the "same knowledgeable sources" confirming another ISIS cell to the west of Ciudad Juárez, targeting the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming. Scary stuff if so. Similar claims not substantiated We’ve found a lack of substance to similar claims. In September 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. found no independent or law-enforcement corroboration of a statement that "ISIS is present in Ciudad Juárez." National security experts advised it’s unlikely ISIS would operate in Mexico and stage an attack by crossing the border. The next month, we rated Pants on Fire a congressman’s claim that at least 10 ISIS fighters had been caught in Texas after coming across the border and there are "dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol." When we inquired, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, called the claim "categorically false." By email, Catron said the department "continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border." Judicial Watch: Identifying sources ‘would get them killed’ For this fact check, we asked Judicial Watch, an educational foundation that says it focuses on ensuring political and judicial officials do not abuse their powers, to elaborate on its post. By phone, Christopher Farrell, its director of investigations and research, told us the web post did not identify the two key sources because neither one was authorized to speak on the record and identifying them "would get them killed." Other authorities, government agencies see no fire Separately, we asked security experts about the claim. Daniel Byman, a Georgetown University professor, emailed: "It's hard for me to say there definitely isn't something there, though I'd be very surprised if this were true. You'd want someone from FBI or DHS to confirm/deny." We tried that tack; agencies signaled skepticism. Homeland Security’s Catron referred us to the National Security Council whose spokesman, Alistair Baskey, said by email: "There is no indication that this claim has any validity to it." Meantime, an FBI spokesman left a voice message with us responding to our inquiry. El Paso-based Michael Martinez said: "As far as we’re concerned, there is no credible information to support that." We also called Mexico’s embassy in Washington, D.C. By email, the embassy’s press office provided a denial evidently prepared the day Judicial Watch made its post: "The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies each of the statements made today by the organization Judicial Watch on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region, particularly at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua - El Paso, Texas." The embassy said "relevant authorities operating in the region have also confirmed the nonexistence of these activities with their U.S. counterparts, with whom they will continue to work closely and to exchange information at our common border." Texas Department of Public Safety: 'No credible information' In Texas, we reached Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, who said by email the agency "has no credible information to corroborate or validate this story." We were struck by the reaction of Monica Varela, a public information officer for the El Paso County sheriff’s office. After we summarized the Judicial Watch conclusion there’s an ISIS camp in Mexico near El Paso, Varela said by phone: "Holy Jesus Christ." Later, Chris Acosta, the department’s public affairs director, said by email the department couldn’t provide relevant information; after all, its deputies don’t patrol the Mexico side of the border. Also in El Paso, Victor Manjarrez, a former longtime U.S. Border Patrol official and associate director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, told us he didn’t find the Judicial Watch item believable -- in part because the described location of the camp is a suburb of Ciudad Juárez that’s modern by Mexican standards. Generally, Manjarrez said by phone, the group’s statement is "really silly." Judical Watch stands by its post We shared what we’d gathered with Judicial Watch. By phone, Farrell said the center stands by its item. He questioned the credibility of Manjarrez, who he described as retiring from the Border Patrol under a cloud. "He may not be the most authoritative expert," Farrell said. Manjarrez later said by phone he went to court in connection with his retirement to make sure he was fully paid for his service and ended up happy with the outcome; he said he also signed a nondisclosure agreement. Our ruling Judicial Watch said it confirmed ISIS has a camp in Mexico a few miles from El Paso. U.S., Mexico and Texas officials told us they had no information to validate or corroborate this bombshell. Lacking any on-the-record indication of the claim's accuracy, we rate it False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-02413	Says Vladimir Putin once said, "The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/06/john-bolton/did-vladimir-putin-call-breakup-ussr-greatest-geop/	Russian President Vladimir Putin’s handling of the uprising in Ukraine is not surprising if you look at telling comments he made years ago, says former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations turned conservative television pundit John Bolton. A Fox News host asked Bolton if he agreed with Ukraine’s prime minister who said the country is "on the brink of disaster." Bolton, who served at the U.N. during George W. Bush’s time in the White House, said it seemed pretty accurate. "I think Putin knows that he has the high cards, militarily, economically and politically, and he’s prepared to use them," Bolton said. "He gave us notice of his strategy seven or eight years ago when he said, in what is now one of the most frequently repeated quotes from his leadership in Russia, when he said, ‘The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.’ "It’s clear he wants to re-establish Russian hegemony within the space of the former Soviet Union. Ukraine is the biggest prize, that’s what he’s after. The occupation of the Crimea is a step in that direction." We wanted to know if Bolton correctly characterized Putin’s comments. We reached out to Bolton through his political action committee and the American Enterprise Institute, where he is a senior fellow, but did not hear back. Putin’s 2005 speech to Russians Putin, a veteran of the Soviet spy agency called the KGB, made the comments Bolton cites in an April 2005 state of the nation address to the country’s top politicians and parliament. A version is available in English from the Kremlin archives. Putin’s words vary depending on the translation, but the idea remains the same. From the Kremlin: "Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself." The Associated Press translation is a little differently, subbing "catastrophe" for "disaster," and calling the breakup the "greateast geopolitical catastrophe of the century." That language is a little more in line with what Bolton said. Whatever the word choice, it’s clear Putin believed there were problems created by the breakup of the Soviet Union. Putin, who had revived some Soviet iconography as president, focused the rest of his speech on developing Russia as a free and democratic country, though he promised to be tough on popular uprisings inspired by surrounding countries. His speech came as President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offered public skepticism of the country’s "managed democracy," leading Putin to declare Russia would "independently determine" its definition of democracy. Still, it was his lament for the dissolved Soviet Union that dominated news coverage. The remark was alarming to westerners, illustrating a deep contrast in perspectives of an event that many consider a glorious moment in time, said Dina Spechler, an Indiana University associate professor of political science who teaches Soviet and Russian foreign policy. Spechler said she did not find a problem with Bolton’s characterization, though she added Putin does not want a return of Soviet-era economic centralization. "I think it’s quite legitimate and fair, and it’s been true for some time now that Putin wants to re-establish Russian hegemony," Spechler said. "He calls it an area of primary Russian interest -- making sure that these countries remain loyal." Spechler does not predict a full-scale escalation of force by Russia in Ukraine, she said, but she would not rule it out given the crisis between Russia and Georgia in 2008. Ukraine is a large country with strong cultural links to Russia looked upon as a Slavic brother, she said. "What we’re seeing today is the most significant step Russia has taken, and it is likely to take a while, to fulfill the agenda that was heralded when he called the breakup a tragedy," she said. The "upshot" of the speech was that if the greatest geopolitical tragedy was the breakup of the USSR, the greatest geopolitical achievement should be the reformulation of a Russian superstate, said Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Heritage Foundation. He wasn’t pining for a new USSR That’s not the only view of Putin’s remarks, however. Other scholars we consulted say there is more nuance in the meaning of Putin’s words. Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin, a 2013 book by Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution, addresses the "often misquoted line" about the demise of the USSR: "Most references to this line have suggested that Putin was bemoaning the loss of the communist economic and political system," the book reads, "but Putin has since frequently underscored that he was talking about the collapse of the Russian state itself." Gaddy elaborated in an interview with PunditFact, saying Putin is not eager to re-establish the USSR, partly because it would be costly for Russia, which subsidized many Soviet countries during that era. He does, however, want to make sure surrounding countries are not used against Russia. Gaddy said Putin does not see Ukraine as a prize, as Bolton suggested, but as a potential liability and realm for anti-Russian activity. "His nightmare has long been that Ukrainian instability would be used to sap Russia’s attention and strength, or worse — that it would be used to entrap Russia into intervening militarily and getting bogged down," Gaddy said. "The nightmare is coming real." Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University’s history and government department, challenged Bolton’s assertion that Putin’s remarks in years past foreshadowed the modern events in Ukraine. It’s more complicated, he said. Yes, Russia moved aggressively into Chechnya, South Ossetia and Crimea, but it was not on a whim -- it was to prevent instability along the border after years of NATO expansions, Janda said. Plus, Russia would not have worked in recent years to stabilize its dealings and cooperation with Western countries if it had planned to invade Ukraine all along, he said. "All Putin meant when he said in 2005 that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a catastrophe was that it launched protests and uprisings and sectarian violence, which is true," Janda said. "Those of us in the West are okay with that because we saw in those uprisings the birth of new nations and greater freedom, but that doesn’t mean it came without cost or that the Russians were thrilled by it." Our ruling Bolton told a Fox News host that Putin once said, "The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century." Putin did say those words, or at least words close to that, in a 2005 address to Russian political leaders. Bolton went on to tell a Fox News host those words are evidence Putin wants to expand Russia’s influence to where it was in the Soviet days. The record there is not as clear. We found some experts who agree with Bolton’s interpretation, while others who say Bolton is extracting a quote that does not quite mean what he says it does. Bolton’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	John Bolton	None	None	None	2014-03-06T11:02:41	2014-03-03	['Soviet_Union', 'Vladimir_Putin']
