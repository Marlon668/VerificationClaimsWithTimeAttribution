The evidence with the title 'Exponent properties with products (video) | Khan Academy ' says Learn how to simplify expressions like (5^6)/(5^2). Also learn how 1/(a^b) is the same as a^-b . Towards the end of the video, we practice simplifying more complex expressions like ( 25 * x * y^6)/(20 * y^5 * x^2).
