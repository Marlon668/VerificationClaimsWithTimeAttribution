The claim with the title 'Fitzgerald: ‘ choice ’ schools outperform peers; experts say picture is mixed ' says In september 2017, Senate majority leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, released a statement about the Parental Choice Programs in Wisconsin, which are voucher programs that allow low-income students to attend selected private schools. Fitzgerald claimed that students in Parental Choice Programs across Wisconsin are outperforming their peers on the ACT, a college preparedness exam taken by all 11th graders in the state. Fitzgerald made this claim after the state Department Of Public Instruction released the results for learning assessments administered during the 2016-17 school year.
