The claim with the title 'Wisconsin leaders both praise and decry Foxconn deal; we examine their claims ' says On july 26, Foxconn Technology Group announced plans to invest $10 billion to build a new factory in Wisconsin. The unveiling of the plan was made at the White House, with Foxconn chairman Terry Gou along with president Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence, gov. Scott Walker, House speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and U.S. sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. In light of Walker’s 2018 re-election campaign as well as a national concern over the health of American manufacturing, the news was significant. State officials later negotiated an agreement calling for the Taiwanese manufacturer to receive up to $3 billion in state tax subsidies — an incentive that some elected officials, primarily Democrats, questioned as the tax breaks were written into law. The deal for the new LCD screen manufacturing complex has since passed the Legislature and was signed by Walker, cementing Foxconn as the largest foreign recipient of state subsidies in the nation. As the deal headed toward final approval, political leaders chimed in on the impact, both positive and negative of the plant, which is to be built in Mount Pleasant in Racine County.
