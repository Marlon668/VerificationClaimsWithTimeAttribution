The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: Minnesota’s child care costs ' says Earlier this week, gov. Mark Dayton unveiled a cornerstone of his second-term agenda: more assistance for people sending their kids to day care. Dayton wants to expand an existing child care tax credit to cover 130,000 Minnesota families. To make his case, Dayton’s administration said in a press release thatMinnesota’schild care costs are unusually expensive. “right now in Minnesota, child care costs $901 per month, on average – totaling $10,812 per year just to provide quality care for one child. These high costs makeMinnesotainathe 3rd-most expensive state in the nationforonachild care, based on the cost of infant care as a ashareof amedianincome (15.5%).” There are a lot of rankings and a lot of ways to measure the cost of care, but any way you look at it, Minnesota is among the most expensive places in the country to send children to day care.
