The evidence with the title 'Lindsey Graham on twitter: "i've known Chuck Schumer for years ... ' says Mar 1, 2018  ... Schumer will vote ' no ' on judicial nominee because he is white ... He is not a racist , but this was an absolutely shameful reason to vote  ... Frankly it is a massive step backward .  ... . Schumer's dance/ statements warrant only contempt.  ... Could you imagine if @potus or @VP said something like this ? ??
