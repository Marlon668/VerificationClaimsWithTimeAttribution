The evidence with the title 'Cutting the cord: PBS not included in most cable alternatives ' says Apr 15, 2018  ... Why is n't PBS included in the cable alternatives?  ... Offer fewer channels and cost one - third or more of traditional cable bills.  ... For TVs , tablets and phones, but all the shows are n't day and date viewing.  ... So i would love to cut the cord but @ youtubetv nor @directvnow have @pbs as alocal channel option !
