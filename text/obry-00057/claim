The claim with the title 'State funding for schools in the 94th assembly district: increasing or decreasing? ' says The candidates vying for a seat in Wisconsin’s 94th Assembly District addressed state education funding late august. After incumbent Democrat Steve Doyle said in an interview with News 8 that a lack of state funding over the last six years was forcing schools to use referendums to cover costs, Republican challenger Julian Bradley, of La Crosse, said that funding for local districts had in fact increased recently. “ people like to talk about the cuts, but we’ve actually seen increases. The La Crosse School District, the Onalaska School District, West Salem, Melrose-Mindoro, we’ve seen increases across the board in funding in all of those areas, i want to make sure those continue to happen, ” said Bradley to News 8 reporters. Is Bradley correct? It depends on when you start counting.
