The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: McFadden’s claims about Franken ad accurate ' says It starts to feel a little like the Twilight Zone when PoliGraph fact-checks a fact-check. But when Mike McFadden, who is seeking the GOP party’s endorsement to challenge sen. Al Franken in the general election, sent out a fact-check challenging Franken’s first ad of the campaign season, we couldN’t resist. Franken’s ad features a local business owner and touts Franken’s efforts to train workers for more technologically demanding jobs. Here’s what McFadden’s press release said: “ the ad highlights Franken’s ‘ Community College to Career Fund Act, ’ a bill that hasN’t received a single hearing in the Democrat led Senate Committee On Health, Education, Labor, And Pensions. ”It goes on to say: “ the ‘ Workforce Investment Act Of 2013,’ which includes similar language to Franken’s bill, has yet to receive a vote on the Senate floor. ”
