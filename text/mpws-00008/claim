The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: Erhardt’s bird flu claim is false ' says For some Minnesota poultry farmers this year’s massive avian flu outbreak is the worst they’ve ever seen. Nearly 3.8 million birds have died from the virus or were killed to prevent it from spreading. It’s hit the state’s $800 million turkey farming industry the hardest. In the midst of the crisis, legislators have discussed emergency funding to help poultry farmers deal with the outbreak, and have made a point to promote consumption of Minnesota turkeys. But one DFL legislator took to the House floor to give a bizarre speech about why he’s worried about the risk of humans getting avian flu. Rep. Ron Erhardt, DFL-Edina said that after eating turkey over the weekend “ he was all flu-ed out ” and referred to eating turkeys as “ possible poison, ” saying that there has been transference of avian flu to humans in the past.
