The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: truth elusive in state auditor claims ' says By now you have probably heard of Minnesota’s State Auditor. That’s because a change in the state auditor’s responsibilities was, at least for a few days, the main reason legislators hadN’t met yet for a special session. Because of a law that passed during the regular session, counties can outsource their audits to accounting firms instead of having the state auditor’s office do the work. Rep. Sarah Anderson, R- Plymouth, who sponsored the state government funding bill, which included the change, said the idea is to save counties money. State auditor Rebecca Otto says the change will gut her office, and she plans to take the issue to court.
