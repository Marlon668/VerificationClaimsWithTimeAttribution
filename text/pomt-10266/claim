The claim says "more than 12,500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the "DoN't Ask, DoN't Tell" policy was implemented, at a cost of over $360 million. Many of those forced out had special skills in high demand, such as translators, engineers, and pilots."
