The claim with the title 'Lead paint donations raise questions of pay-to-play politics in Wisconsin ' says State Senate minority Jennifer Shilling and Waupaca mayor Brian Smith recently criticized state sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, for allegedly participating in pay-to-play politics. On sept. 14, Shilling accused Olsen of voting for changes in the budget that would have protected lead paint producers from new and retroactive lawsuits. Those votes occurred around the same time that a major lead paint manufacturer donated heavily in support of Republican senators facing recall, including Olsen. Smith, who is running against Olsen for the District 14 seat in the state Senate this november, echoed the accusation on sept. 20.
