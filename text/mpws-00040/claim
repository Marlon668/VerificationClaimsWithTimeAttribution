The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: DFL claims about Ortman’s record mostly true ' says With the Republican endorsing convention more than a month away, the state’s DFL party still has a wide field of GOP candidates to target. Among them is state sen. Julianne Ortman, R-Chanhassen, who is seeking her party’s endorsement to run against Democratic sen. Al Franken. The DFL is using Ortman’s record as a legislator to paint her as out of step with Minnesota. Here’s what DFL chair Ken Martin said in a recent press release about Ortman after she was endorsed by former Alaska gov. Sarah Palin. “ [Ortman] is wrong on women’s reproductive health, voting for a bill that defunded all family planning programs in the state. She’s wrong on immigration reform, saying she would have opposed the overwhelmingly bipartisan Senate immigration bill. And she’s wrong on health care, promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take us back to the days when people with pre-existing conditions couldn’t get covered and insurance companies were allowed to charge women more than men for coverage. ”
