We check out Dave Considine’s estimates ' says As the state minimum wage rose toward the top of the policy agenda in the most recent election season, Wisconsin Assembly Democrats have indicated they will look to increase wages in the upcoming legislative session. During an aug. 29 interview with WisconsinEye, recently re-elected rep. Dave Considine, d-Baraboo, advocated for raising Wisconsin’s minimum wage to $15 an hour — more than double the current rate of $7.25 an hour — over the course of up to six years. Qualifying his statement, Considine said the change should include an age-based tier system in which the hourly rate is higher for adults than it is for minors. He also said that many employers already paid above the current minimum wage.
