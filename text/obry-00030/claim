The claim with the title 'Examining Wisconsin’s unemployment rates ' says When the United States was hit with a recession nearly a decade ago, Wisconsin was not spared from widespread economic downturn and unemployment. But in the years following the Great Recession, Wisconsin’s unemployment rates have been looking up. The Wisconsin Department Of Workforce Development released a report from the U.S. Bureau Of Labor Statistics june 22 outlining the state’s unemployment statistics. Four months later, now-sen. Tom Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, penned a column published in the Green Bay Press-Gazette boasting Wisconsin’s low unemployment rate statistics. “Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is at 4.2 percent and our state now has a record number of people working. Workers who want full-time employment are now having an easier time finding it,” Tiffany wrote.
