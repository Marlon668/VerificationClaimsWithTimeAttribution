The claim with the title 'Olsen accurately claims $200 million k-12 funding increase, but it’s not all going toward educating students ' says During a discussion at Ripon College on oct. 27, state sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, made the following claim: “ i’ve been fortunate enough in the Committee On Joint Finance to really work and push to not cut … but to increase the money for K-12 education in our state. This last budget we’ve increased it $200 million dollars more than the governor put forth. ”The Wisconsin Legislature’s Joint Committee On Finance – sometimes referred to as the Joint Finance Committee or the Committee On Joint Finance – is a bipartisan, 16-member committee responsible for reviewing all bills introduced “ for the appropriation of money, providing for revenue or relating to taxation. ”In 2015, Olsen served as one of the Committee’s vice chairs. Republican governor Scott Walker’s 2015-17 state budget proposal included a $127 million cut to K-12 public education funding in the first year.
