The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: Seifert misleads on campaign dollars ' says Marty Seifert has issued a challenge to gov. Mark Dayton: refuse campaign contributions from lobbyists. Seifert says he’s never taken lobbyist contributions and wants Dayton, whom Seifert hopes to unseat this fall, to do the same. “not accepting lobbyist contributions so far this election, and in all my previous elections, has made my campaign unique,” said Seifert in a press release. Seifert’s campaign finance reports don’t include lobbyist contributions. But that doesN’t mean he hasN’t taken them.
