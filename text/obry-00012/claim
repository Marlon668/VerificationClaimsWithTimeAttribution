The claim with the title 'Did Milwaukee’s old residency rule lead to lower quality city workers? ' says Republican state senator and U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir posted on Facebook on march 6 that the residency rule in Milwaukee “ prevented highly qualified teachers, police officers and firefighters from opting to work in the city ” and that “ removing these barriers helps Milwaukee retain and attract many valuable workers who were once discouraged by the residency rule. ”Her post was accompanied by a link to a Fox6Now story by Myra Sanchick on the impact of the removal of the rule. The Observatory fact-checked Vukmir’s statement. The residency rule required people who work for the city of Milwaukee to live within the city limits. The residency rule in Milwaukee was in place for 75 years until it was removed by a 2013 state law, which was upheld by a decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2016.
