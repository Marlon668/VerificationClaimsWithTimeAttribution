The claim with the title 'Promise check: clear the 30,000 backlog of asylum seekers waiting to be processed ' says A surge in asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat through people smuggling operations led the Labor government to suspend immigration processing for people arriving by boat in 2010 and again between august 2012 and july 2013. By the time of the september 2013 election, more then 30,000 asylum seekers were awaiting final determination of their cases.
