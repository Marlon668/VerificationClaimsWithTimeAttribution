The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: DFL correct about HHS budget ‘ hole ’' says A key piece of the budget proposal from Republicans in the Minnesota House is a bill to fund health and human services. It cuts more than $1 billion in spending, effectively allowing the GOP to cut taxes by $2 billion. The proposal has been controversial among Democrats, in part because $500 million of the savings come from ending MinnesotaCare, a health insurance program for the working poor. Democrats are also pointing to another cut in the billthat they contend amounts to a budget gimmick. They say the plan’s projected $300 million in savings from eliminating waste and fraud from Medicaid and other public programs would actually yield much less – around $16.5 million – which they say would leave a $283 million hole in the GOP budget for the coming biennium.
