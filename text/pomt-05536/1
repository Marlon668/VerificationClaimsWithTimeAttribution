The evidence with the title 'Martha M. Hamilton | PolitiFact ' says Fake 'Arizona border raid' a lie that won't die. A version of a chain email debunked two years ago makes fresh rounds â€” with a fresh date. "why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border?  ... Seizure was just five days ago . Right on the Arizona border!" Just five days ago? On the Arizona border? Nope.
