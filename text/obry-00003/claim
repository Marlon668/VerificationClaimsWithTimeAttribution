The claim with the title 'Wisconsin’s rate of lead poisoning worse than Flint, Michigan’s ' says Flint, Michigan, the city known for its contaminated water crisis, has something in common with Wisconsin — childhood lead poisoning. According to Wisconsin U.S. rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee, the proportion of children with elevated blood lead levels among Wisconsin’s children has risen close to those of Flint. In a letter to the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention, Moore said, “ the rate of lead poisoning among children in Wisconsin is nearly equal to Flint, Michigan. ”The Observatory decided to check this claim.
