The evidence with the title 'When someone at home has the flu ' says Please, keep your germs to yourself! Always cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze . • Use a tissue instead of a cloth handkerchief. • Place used tissues in the wastebasket and wash your hands right away . • Don't use your bare hand to cover your cough . If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper arm .
