The claim with the title 'Does Walker have a plan to fund UW’s fifth year of frozen tuition? ' says During a sept. 22 speech at Ripon College, Waupaca mayor Brian Smith expressed his disapproval of extending the UW System’s in-state tuition freeze through a fifth year, citing the decision makers ’ lack of a plan for dealing with the losses suffered from the freeze. On oct. 7, the Board Of Regents voted unanimously in favor of a resolution to the state budget that would freeze tuition through the 2017-18 academic year, but then raise tuition by a small increment for 2018-19. Republican gov. Scott Walker and the state legislature will ultimately decide whether or not to include the resolution in the final 2017-19 budget. Asked if he would advise against the freeze, Smith, who was unsuccessful in his challenge of Republican incumbent Luther Olsen for the 14th district in the state Senate, made the following claim: “ if you’re going to freeze tuition, then you have to find another way to fund education at the university level. And they (Walker and the Republican party) haveN’t come up with a plan. Except, the plan is to have massive layoffs – – of not only professors, but also to have layoffs of their assistants – – and increase class sizes. ”
