The evidence with the title 'LYRICS â€” caamp ' says Saving up to chase women in the college sun  ... But you 're scared of the dark i do n't care where you're from  ... And i know you like the women with their skin in the sun  ... And it 's clear that you can't see, you were wrong sometimes  ... I 'll get a job stacking bricks , stay at home with the kids  ... I ca n't help it now, autumn leaves .
