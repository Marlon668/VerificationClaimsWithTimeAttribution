The claim with the title 'Dem. Challenger claims Wisconsin wages low under gov. Scott Walker ' says In response to gov. Scott Walker’s State Of The State address in january, Milwaukee attorney and Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn released a statement claiming that “ Wisconsin still lags behind the rest of the country in wage growth. Adjusted for inflation, median wages today are lower than they were before (Walker) was elected. ”The Observatory checked both claims by the Democratic candidate: that Wisconsin’s wages have grown more slowly than the rest of the country and that our median wages are lower today than in 2010. According to Flynn, Wisconsin’s wages are not growing fast enough to match or surpass the U.S. average. Reviewing data from the Census Bureau shows that the since 2010, the median wages in Wisconsin have lagged behind the U.S. median wage.
