The claim with the title 'Testin addresses “ same failed leadership”in video advertisement ' says Republican Patrick Testin ran against Democratic incumbent Julie Lassa for Wisconsin State Senate in District 24 and won the election by just over 4,000 votes. Testin released a video advertisement on november 2 entitled “ Raise The Bar ” where he stated the following: “ we’ve been weighed down by 18 years of the same failed leadership, but together we can lift our communities back up. ”This advertisement employs broad and ambiguous terms, such as “ we, ” “ failed ” and “ communities ” without context for what those terms are defined as in relation to the campaign. While unspecified terms can potentially appeal to a wider audience, it also doesN’t answer any real policy issue questions or explain what Testin would do as a candidate if elected to public office.
