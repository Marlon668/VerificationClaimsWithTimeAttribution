The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: several GOP gov. hopefuls want to end MNsure ' says A political group called Compete! Minnesota released itsfirst ad this week in support of potential Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Honour. The ad has a lot of nice things to say about Honour’s personality and business background. Compete! Minnesota has personal ties to honour. But the part that stuck out to PoliGraph was this statement about Honour’s stance on the state’s health insurance exchange, MNsure, as it compares to what the other GOP gubernatorial hopefuls are saying. “ only honour wants to scrap the whole program, ” the ad states, quoting a blog post from Politics.mn, a website run by former Senate aide Michael Brodkorb. Honour is hardly alone among Republican candidates for governor in wanting to get rid of MNsure.
