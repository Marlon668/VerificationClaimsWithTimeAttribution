The claim with the title 'Holbrook ties VanderMeer to massive UW cuts ' says Mark Holbrook, Democratic candidate for Wisconsin’s 70th assembly district, claimed on his campaign website that his GOP opponent was complicit in a $250 million budget cut to the UW system pushed by gov. Scott Walker. Holbrook said, “in addition, our representative (Nancy VanderMeer) voted to preserve the $250 million cut to the UW System And Colleges: one of the highest cuts to higher education in the country.” Lawmakers voted 52-46 to pass the 2015-17 biennial budget, which included $250 million worth of cuts to the UW system over a two-year period, alongside the removal of protections for tenured faculty.
