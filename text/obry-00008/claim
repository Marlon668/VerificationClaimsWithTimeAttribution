The claim with the title 'Sensenbrenner makes sense: the U.S. banned guns in schools 20 years ago ' says Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, who represents the Fifth Congressional District in southeast Wisconsin, said in a town hall meeting in Watertown on feb. 25 that, “ there has been a law on the books for over 20 years that makes it illegal to carry a firearm within 1,000 feet of any school in the country. ”The Observatory decided to examine the different elements of this claim — that the law has existed for over 20 years and that it is illegal to carry a firearm within 1,000 feet of any school. Sensenbrenner’s office provided The Observatory with information that this claim was in reference to the gun-Free School Zones Act (GFSZA) of 1990 (Senate Bill 2070). The legislation was part of the Crime Control Act of 1990.
