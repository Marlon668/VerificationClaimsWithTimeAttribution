The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: Gruenhagen climate claim doesn’t hold up ' says During a state House debate on a jobs and energy bill this week, Democrats offered an amendment that would put the Legislature on record saying that climate change is real and that humans are causing it. Late in the debate, House minority leader Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, quizzed a number of Republican representatives on their views on climate change. Among them was rep. Glen Gruenhagen, R-Glencoe, who has said in the past that he’s skeptical climate change is real. Thissen asked him if he thinks climate change is caused by human activity. “ i believe there are eminently qualified scientists who would disagree [that climate change is caused by human activity], and i agree with those scientists, ” Gruenhagen said. Gruenhagen has a right to his opinion, but his comments – and comments made by other Legislators during the debate – suggest the scientific community is divided on the topic.
