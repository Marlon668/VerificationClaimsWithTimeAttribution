The evidence with the title 'Valley Forge - Wikipedia ' says Washington and his troops had fought in early december what was the last major engagement of 1777 at the Battle Of White Marsh (or Edge Hill). He devised to pull his troops from their present encampment in the White Marsh area (now Fort Washington State Park) and move to a more secure location for the coming winter.
