The claim with the title 'Testin addresses the “ average ” Wisconsin college student in his Wisconsin Education Achievement Initiative ' says Patrick Testin is the member-elect of the Wisconsin State Senate for district 24 after defeating incumbent Julie Lassa in the nov. 8 election. Testin’s plan for state education reform, the Wisconsin Education Achievement Initiative, proposes to limit the number of general education requirements, change the “ staff dynamics ” in the UW System, link tuition increases to the Consumer Price Index, increase competition through better education and offer refinancing options to fiscally responsible students. In his Wisconsin Education Achievement Initiative, Testin claims: the average student earns an undergraduate degree in six years that costs upwards of $150,000. This hefty price tag exceeds the annual household income for an average family.
