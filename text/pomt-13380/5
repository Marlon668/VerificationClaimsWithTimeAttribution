The evidence with the title 'Hillary Clinton on Free Trade ' says TRUMP said, "you called [TPP] the gold standard of trade deals. And then you heard what i said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it. " Clinton responded, " i did say i hoped it would be a good deal. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out." THE fact checker: Trump is right.
