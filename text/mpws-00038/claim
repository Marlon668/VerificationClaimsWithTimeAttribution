The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: Dayton’s tax cut claims leave out context ' says Gov. Mark Dayton is touting a package of tax cuts he signed into law recently as evidence that his administration is out to help middle class Minnesotans. Democrats say the cuts were possible because the state has a surplus. Republicans say Democrats are trying to make themselves look good during an election year. “ this session, the governor signed into law $508 million in tax relief for middle class families and Minnesota businesses, ” says a primer on Dayton’s tax cuts. “ these new tax cuts benefit middle class Minnesotans, including seniors, farmers, teachers, working families, and small businesses. ”It’s true that Dayton signed a bill that lowered taxes by about $508 million, but he also raised taxes by $2.1 billion in the previous session.
