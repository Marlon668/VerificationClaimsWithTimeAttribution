The claim with the title 'Bewley: state economic development spending low in northwest Wisconsin ' says Since its inception in july 2011, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. has offered nearly $2 billion worth of financial awards, such as tax credits, loans and grants, to support economic growth in the state. However, state sen. Janet Bewley, d-Ashland, asserted in a statement on feb. 9 that WEDC financial awards aren’t equally distributed throughout the state’s regions. “ since Gov. Walker and Republicans created the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) in 2011, Northwest Wisconsin has received less than 5 percent of the award dollars WEDC has distributed, ” Bewley said. “ but our businesses stepped up and created over 10 percent of the new private jobs. ”
