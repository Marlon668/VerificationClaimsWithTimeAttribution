The claim with the title 'Green Party BDS controversy: 'a little baloney' In claim resolution process is 'very different' ' says " the (green party's) resolution process is very different from other parties. Members come up with resolutions independently. Neither the leader nor anyone in the executive of the party can reject resolutions that comply with submission guidelines, nor does the party know ahead of time what resolutions will come forward. This grassroots process is a testament to the democratic values of the party."
