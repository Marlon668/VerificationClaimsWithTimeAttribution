The claim with the title 'Has president Jacob Zuma’s government done ‘ a good job’ ? ' says “ South Africans have continued to trust government with their taxes. South Africa’s budget in 1994 was r135.1-billion; by 2004 this had doubled to r370-billion and r834-billion in 2009. The minister of Finance recently announced a budget of r1.3-trillion. This means that since 2009 we have added more than the equivalent of the entire budget of 2004 and seen a 1,000% increase since 1994. ”
