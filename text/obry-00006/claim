The claim with the title 'Drug dealers vs. children: who is crossing U.S.-Mexico border and why? ' says Congressman Mark Pocan recently responded to a letter that Wisconsin gov. Scott Walker wrote to president Donald Trump supporting the president’s “ aggressive actions to secure America’s southern border. ”The Wisconsin Democrat Pocan wrote that, “ president Trump is not sending troops to the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico. It is clear that his goal is to apprehend migrants, many of whom are children fleeing violence in their home countries. ”While we are unable to accurately assess Trump’s motivations, The Observatory decided to check the claim that many of the people coming across the southwest border who are unauthorized are children and that they are fleeing violence in their home countries.
