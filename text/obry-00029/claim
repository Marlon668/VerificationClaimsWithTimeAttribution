The claim with the title 'Are transfers of profits from the King Veterans Home hurting veterans ’ care? ' says In an oct. 26 op-ed for the Cap Times, state sen. Jennifer Shilling, d-La Crosse, criticized gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-run Legislature for failing to address a range of problems at two state-run facilities, including the King Veterans Home. Specifically, Shilling attributed the king nursing facility’s poor conditions and staff shortages to profits transferred from the home for other uses. “ instead of approving $18 million in facility repairs and upgrades, the governor diverted $12 million from the veterans nursing home fund to backfill budget deficits. Republican leaders are set to raid another $18 million from king over the next two years, ” Shilling wrote.
