The claim with the title 'Did gov. Scott Walker add $638 million more in K-12 spending to the current budget? ' says “ our governor cut $1.6b from education is (sic) his first budget, now is putting back $638 million. That’s not progress, it’s an insult, ” Mahlon Mitchell, Democratic candidate for governor and president of the state firefighters union, said in a march 17 tweet. We decided to check how much aid for K-12 education was cut in gov. Scott Walker’s first budget and how much was added to the current budget. Walker proposed an increase of $649 million in education spending in the 2017-18 school year. However, the Legislature approved a budget that brings the boost down to $639 million, by spending less than what Walker proposed on rural schools and high-performing Milwaukee schools.
