The claim with the title 'Portman claims Strickland ineffective in Congress, as governor ' says Incumbent Republican senator Rob Portman is continuing to apply pressure to former Democratic governor Ted Strickland in the Ohio Senate race. In a recent Facebook post on his campaign’s page, Portman made numerous claims pertaining to the effectiveness of Strickland’s political history. “ after 12 years in Congress, Ted Strickland was ranked as one of the most absent and ineffective members of Congress and never authored a single bill that became law. Under governor Ted Strickland, Ohio lost over 350,000 jobs and ranked 48th in job creation, ” said Portman. Strickland served as the representative for Ohio’s 6th Congressional District from 1993-94 and 1997-2006. According to GovTrack — a nonpartisan, open data website that tracks the work of the U.S. Congress — from january 1993 to december 2006, Strickland missed 364 out of 6,954 roll-call votes. Strickland missed 5.2 percent of the votes held during his congressional career, noticeably worse than the 2.9 percent lifetime average among all the representatives serving during december 2006.
