The claim with the title 'The extent of budget cuts to Wisconsin public education ' says Jeff Wright, the District 51 Democratic candidate for Wisconsin’s State Assembly, uses the hashtag #thenextvoteisours to encourage voters to not forget about the decisions made by the adjourned Republican-controlled Assembly. On his campaign’s #thenextvoteisours page, Wright makes the following claim: “ our Republican-controlled Assembly voted to continue its cuts to public education— from kindergarten through college— threatening programs in communities of all sizes that strengthen our democracy and our economy. Since 2011, K-12 education has been cut by over $1 billion, the UW system has lost nearly $800 million in state aid, and the Wisconsin Technical College System has lost over $200 million in state aid. ”Wright is running against incumbent Republican rep. Todd Novak, who was elected to the Assembly in 2014. Novak also supports investing more in Wisconsin public education.
