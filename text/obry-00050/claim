The claim with the title 'Just how much has the UW System lost since 2011? ' says Cuts made in 2011 to the University Of Wisconsin System and tuition freezes have made higher education funding a topic of debate between the two political parties, and 2016 is no different. In an oct. 5 speech to the UW-La Crosse Student Association, state sen. Jennifer Shilling expressed concern about cuts to higher education in Wisconsin. The incumbent Democrat is facing a challenge from former Republican state sen. Dan Kapanke. “ i worry about the state of our university, ” Shilling said. “ since 2011, $250 million have been cut from the UW system with an additional $11 million to (uw-La Crosse). ”
