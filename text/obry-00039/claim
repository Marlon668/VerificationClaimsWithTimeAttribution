The claim with the title 'Democratic challenger accuses incumbent Toomey of conflict of interest ' says While campaigning against Pennsylvania sen. Pat Toomey, Katie McGinty, a Democrat , accused her Republican opponent of acting on a conflict of interest while serving on Senate banking committee. Toomey won reelection by less than a two-percent margin. McGinty claimed that Toomey used his position on the committee to oppose consumer protection measures while owning over half a million dollars in stock in a bank that was engaged in controversial foreclosure methods. When asked by reporters with the Philadelphia Inquirer, McGinty could not point to any direct evidence supporting her claim. “he opposed consumer protections to prevent predatory practices. Now we know why,” McGinty said in a phone call with the Philadelphia Inquirer. McGinty is implying that Toomey, who repeatedly voted against legislation to increase consumer protection from predatory bank practices, did so because of his personal stake in a bank engaging in practices considered controversial.
