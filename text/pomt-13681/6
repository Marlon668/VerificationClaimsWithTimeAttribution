The evidence with the title 'Donald Trump says Democrats are trying to "rig" debates ... ' says Jul 30, 2016  ... In the ABC interview , Trump did allow that three debates were "fine" and that he'd rather have three than one. As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) july 30, 2016.
