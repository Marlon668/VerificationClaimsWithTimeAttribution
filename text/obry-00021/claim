The claim with the title 'Wisconsin Assembly leader: Most school shooters pass a background check. We check it out. ' says In a feb. 21 tweet from his personal Twitter account, Wisconsin state Assembly majority leader Jim Steineke, r-Kaukauna, responded to FOX6 Milwaukee political reporter Theo Keith, writing, “ the truth is school shooters almost exclusively have passed background checks. ”The reply was in response to a tweet that Keith wrote, linking to a story from Fox6Now describing the passage of a bill in the Wisconsin Assembly that will pay for armed guards in schools. According to Fox6Now, the bill’s passage followed a “ raucous debate ” in the Assembly, during which GOP leaders rejected a proposal by Democrats for a mandatory background check on all gun sales. The truth is school shooters almost exclusively have passed background checks. Background checks aren’t likely to prevent the shootings while additional security measure may.
