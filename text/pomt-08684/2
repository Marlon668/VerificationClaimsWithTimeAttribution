The evidence with the title 'Statements from Peter Kilmartin ' says Peter Kilmartin Â· "in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined."  ... " when the mayor of Providence's brother wrote over 100 grand in bad checks to the city, Joe Fernandez didn't have the guts to prosecute him. He let him off the hook.".
