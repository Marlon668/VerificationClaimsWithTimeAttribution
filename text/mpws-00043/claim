The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: checking Senate Office Building claims ' says Get ready to hear a lot about a proposed Senate office building this election season. Republicans are using the project as a way to highlight wasteful spending among their DFL counterparts. Senate Democrats say the space is badly needed to accommodate members of the chamber. Because it’s shaping up to be a major campaign issue, this week’s installment of PoliGraph will look at two claims made about the new construction. First up, this statement from Republican state rep. Kurt Zellers, who is seeking his party’s endorsement to challenge gov. Mark Dayton this fall. “ the $90 million dollar Senate Legislative Office Building and parking ramp the Democrats snuck through the legislature last year is a disaster zone of reckless spending, and governor Dayton and the DFL-controlled legislature think it’s a good idea, ” Zellers wrote in a fundraising letter. “ we’re already one of the highest taxed states in the U.S., and yet governor Dayton just keeps adding to the tab by allowing our tax dollars to be used to build a $90 million complex that won’t even hold all the senators it’s being built for. ”
