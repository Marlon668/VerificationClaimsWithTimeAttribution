The claim says "when i became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As i left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72."
