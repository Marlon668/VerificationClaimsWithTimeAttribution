The evidence with the title 'Fraud and misconduct by new york city school custodians ' says The Board. Although a custodian is a public employee, he is allowed to operate at a level of independence that sets him apart from any other New York City public servant. The individuals the custodian hires are the custodian's, and not the Board's, employees. They are selected by, paid by, and supervised by the custodian.
