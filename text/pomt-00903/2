The evidence with the title 'Electric field direction (video) | Khan Academy ' says The direction of an electrical field at a point is the same as the direction of the electrical force acting on a positive test charge at that point .  ... Therefore , you would n't have to have a constant velocity to calculate this, only the velocity at that specific moment .  ... Someone let me know if iunderstood this wrong :) I hope i helped .
