The evidence with the title 'FALSE: Military can't say 'christmas' per obama order ' says Nov 16, 2015  ... President Obama has not issued an order banning U.S. service members from using the word " christmas ." ... I recently saw an article that states president Obama told the military that they can not say “ Merry Christmas ” anymore. Is there any truth to this? Such bullshit. Obama continues his war on Christians.
