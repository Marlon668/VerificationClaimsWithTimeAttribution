The claim with the title 'Vinehout: act 10 has damaged teachers, education in Wisconsin ' says Wisconsin state sen. Kathleen Vinehout, a Democratic candidate for governor, published the following statement on facebook on march 14, 2018: “ after act 10 teachers left the profession. Young people going into teaching changed their majors. Now we have a teachers ’ shortage. We must repair the damage done by Act 10. We’ve got problems now and they are only going to get bigger. ”The Observatory decided to check. We examined her statement as three separate items. The first being that after the enactment of Act 10, there has been an exodus of teachers in Wisconsin. The second that there are fewer young people pursuing teaching degrees. Lastly that there currently is a teacher shortage in the state.
