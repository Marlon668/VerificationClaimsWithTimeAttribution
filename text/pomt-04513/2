The evidence with the title 'About Mitt Romney's $5 trillion tax cut ' says Oct 4, 2012  ... What i 've said is i won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one . So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if isay i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan . Okay. Now we know that gov. Romney 's tax plan does not call for a $5 trillion tax cut.
