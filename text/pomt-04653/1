The evidence with the title 'New dollar coins and 'In God We Trust' ' says IS gone!!! Who originally put 'In God We Trust' onto our currency? My bet is that it was one of the Presidents on these coins. All our U.S. government has done is dishonor them, and disgust me!!! If ever there was a reason to boycott something, this is it!!!! DO not accept the new dollar coins as change.
