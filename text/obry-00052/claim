The claim with the title 'The debt trail for Wisconsin college graduates ' says Julie Lassa, the Democratic incumbent running for district 24 State Assembly Of Wisconsin, published an op-ed in the Wisconsin Rapids City Times on sept. 9. She discussed student loan debt and a bill called Higher Ed Lower debt. According to Lassa, the bill would create a Wisconsin Student Loan Refinancing Authority, which would allow individuals to refinance their loans through the state. According to Lassa, “ the typical Wisconsin student who graduates with a bachelor’s degree will make student loan payments of about $388 per month for almost 19 years. ”According to the Institute For College Access And Success, an independent nonprofit organization focused on college affordability, the average student debt for a Wisconsin student is $28,810, which Lassa also stated in her article.
