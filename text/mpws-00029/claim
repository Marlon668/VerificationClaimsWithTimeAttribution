The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: McFadden ad exaggerates ' says In his latest ad, Republican Senate hopeful Mike McFadden is employing a classic campaign tactic against sen. Al Franken by linking him to an unpopular president. The ad features a Franken look-alike unsuccessfully backing a boat into a Minnesota lake. “ Al Franken keeps missing the mark, ” the ad states. “ Franken has a 97 percent voting record with president Obama, over 40 votes for higher taxes. And Franken cast the deciding vote for obamacare. ”
