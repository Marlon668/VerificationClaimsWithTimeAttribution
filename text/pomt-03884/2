The evidence with the title 'Stop the blank check to Israel ' says $10 million a day to Israel just doesn't make sense! ACT: sign a "blank check" calling on Congress to end aid to Israel  ... Help us put up more billboards !  ... To other countries on its behalf cost Americans nearly $ 7 million more each day and  ... U.S. support goes far beyond the $ 10 million per day in financial aid that we give it .
