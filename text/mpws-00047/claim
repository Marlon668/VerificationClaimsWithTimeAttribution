The claim with the title 'PoliGraph: AAN Nolan ad mostly accurate ' says If a recent special election in Florida tells us anything, the health care policy will be front and center in the 2014 elections. Republicans won a Florida congressional seat in part by hammering the Democratic candidate on the Affordable Care Act. The same themes are already playing out in Minnesota. Take a recent ad paid for by the American Action Network, a conservative group spearheaded by former Minnesota sen. Norm Coleman. The ad is running in the 8th Congressional District, which is represented by democrat Rick Nolan. It centers on cuts to Medicare Advantage plans, which are offered by private companies approved by Medicare. Messages about the program are meant to resonate with elderly voters, who tend to show up on Election Day. “ for the second year in a row, the Obama administration has proposed deep rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage seniors rely on. Call rep. Nolan and tell him to fight the president’s april 7th medicare advantage cuts, ” the ad states. Meanwhile, flashing across the screen is this statement: “ Rick Nolan voted against repealing Obamacare. ”
