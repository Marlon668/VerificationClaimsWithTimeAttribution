The claim with the title 'Though missing context, Ron Johnson right on minimum wage ' says During an oct. 4 interview with U.S. sen. Ron Johnson, r-Wis., the Beloit Daily News brought up minimum wage, an issue Johnson hasN’t spoken about much during the past two years, despite the issue’s appearance in a recent Senate debate. The article said that Johnson responded by saying if the minimum wage was increased to $10.10 an hour — as president Obama has proposed — it would lead to a half million to a million jobs being lost, but if the minimum wage was raised to $15 an hour, more than 6 million jobs would be lost.
