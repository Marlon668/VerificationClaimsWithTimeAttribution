The claim with the title 'Sen. Ron Johnson wants troops at the Mexican border. Do we need them? ' says In a television interview in april with Fox News, U.S. sen. Ron Johnson, r-Wis., emphasized a need for more help to patrol the United States ’ southern border with Mexico. Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said, “ we do need increased manpower. Part of our problem is our attrition rate is higher than our hiring rate, so we don’t have the number of Border Patrol agents. So i think that’s one of the reasons that’s really prompted the president to call up the National Guard. ”The issue he referred to was president Donald Trump’s recent request to send up to 4,000 National Guard troops to the southern border to help the Border Patrol curb illegal immigration and stop drug smugglers.
